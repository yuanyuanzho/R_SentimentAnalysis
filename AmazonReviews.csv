"1","Earlier this month, my TV entertainment included Dish 200+ channel satellite TV, 20Mbps turbo internet, Netflix, and Amazon Prime. After doing some research, I bought 3 Amazon Fire Sticks with the voice remote, cancelled Dish, upgraded to 30Mbps internet, added Sling 25 channels, added standard Hulu, and CBS All Access. Guess who still gets 96+% of the channels watched, added Prime Music and several hundred shows (that networks don't play) to all the TVs in the house, and saved over $700 per year compared to what I paid this past year? I did. I never thought of ""cutting the cord"" until I really looked into it all. Getting Amazon Fire Sticks are worth it and they work well....and once you get used to knowing what show plays where, it's a no-brainer. Just like how you originally had to figure out how to use a smart phone back in the day. After a while, it's a breeze. I highly recommend everything I listed in this review. Seriously....take a couple hours and make a spread-sheet listing the must-have shows that people in your household watch. Then make a comparison to what's available on the streaming services. If you're like me, and you don't watch 80% of the channels you pay for, it's so worth it."
"2","I didn't really know what to expect so when I got the Firestick it was really easy to use,Alexa is great and very dependable. It was easy to hook up and get started watch movies. And I even bought a TV sound bar to improve my watching experience,TV Sound Bar, Meidong Bluetooth Soundbar with Built-in Subwoofer, 36 inch 2.0 Channel Home Theater Speakers, Wireless and Wired Bluetooth Audio for TV/PC/ Phones/Tablets/ Echo dot (2017 Model) it is a really good partner with my old TVs,also recommend.The original software is still there so you can use it with your Amazon Account too. Simply follow the instructions normally to install it on your TV. I had kodi installed and can stream more content than I could ever watch. I can't compare this against the old stick but this is fast, no buffering for me. The layout on the screen is easy to use and navigate. The remote is very tactile and responsive. I love that you get the hdmi dongle as my tv has hard to access ports. I'm planning on buying another for my son's tv soon.I found that the included power adapter isn't really necessary as long as you have a powered USB Port on your TV to plug it in to.I did notice that if you are using the 2.4GHZ wireless on your Wireless Network it does affect the speed especially if you have COMCAST/XFinity-, or other Cable provider as they are throttling the 2.4GHZ bandwidth to 25Gbps. They are doing that to pretty much force people to upgrade or update their devices to the 5GHZ bandwidth. If you don't know for sure run a SpeedTest and find out what your download speed is- upload is not at Full Duplex so it will be slower on both bands. Recommend if you have the 5GHZ band to use that band so you can use the Firestick at the optimal speed. Yes, the Firestick has 5GHZ band! Love the Firestick.What do you need to make it work?====The Stick attaches to an HDMI port on your TV or projector. It comes pre-loaded with your Amazon account details, so the only setup you need is to plug it in and enter your WiFi password, using a simple on-screen prompt. There's no need to go hunting for obscure settings.Power is supplied by a small USB wall adapter, but you can power it from any 1A USB socket. My TV has a USB port, but it doesn't supply enough power for the Stick.You need a decent WiFi signal in the location you intend to use the TV. It’s essential to have a decent internet connection (I’d recommend at least 5 MB/sec), and preferably an unlimited data package (otherwise, video streaming will burn through your data allowance in no time).A short HDMI extension cable is included, which is handy if your TV has awkwardly-positioned ports. As with the previous-gen Stick, the extension cable also seems to boost WiFi reception a bit.The Alexa Voice Remote====Despite the new name, the Alexa Voice Remote is identical to the previous Fire TV Stick voice remote. It’s small, but fairly hefty, and is comfortable to hold. It has the usual 4-way navigation pad and media controls, but no volume buttons - you’ll need to keep your TV remote handy for that. It connects via WiFi, not infra-red, so you can safely tuck the Fire TV stick behind your wall-mounted TV and it will still work fine.The remote’s major selling-point is the built-in mic, Unlike with the Amazon Echo.Fees====You need a subscription to Amazon Video ($8.99/month) or Amazon Prime ($99/year) to stream movies and TV shows. Note that whilst there is lots of free-with-subscription content, some items still require a rental fee, especially recent movies (rentals are $3.99 in HD). Some new-release movies are purchase-only."
"3","The Amazon Fire Stick is an amazing device. Television services are moving away from cable and satellite and are moving toward internet based streaming formats. These internet based services work from apps (software packets) and the AFS (Amazon Fire Stick) provides you with these apps. In fact, it provides you with every kind of app you can think of and the AFS does it at an affordable price.The AFS plugs into the HDMI jack on your television and also comes with a power adapter that plugs into the wall. The AFS is controlled by a remote control that comes with the device. In order to receive signals, the AFS requires WIFI or a local hot spot with speed requirements of around 5 Mbps for HD broadcasts. Movies and shows displayed by the device are typically in HD quality with good picture and sound quality. It is easy to set up and use and I was up and running in minutes.Many television channels you receive through cable or satellite services, like the History Channel for example, offer programming over the internet. In order to watch these shows on a television, you need a hardware device that converts these shows into a format the television can use (HDMI plug). It also has to be loaded with a software packet for the particular channel you want to watch. The AFS is a device that provides you with both the hardware and software needed to watch such shows and it bundles everything together nicely so it is extremely easy to use.Shows available to watch on the AFS vary how they can be accessed for viewing. Some apps (channels) are free and they offer limited programming on demand from shows they aired in the past. Others require monthly fees. Some apps like Sling, Hulu, PlayStation Vue, etc. offer multiple channels all on the same app. PlayStation Vue (the one I signed up with) offers bundled packages of channels just like cable or satellite services and they are live broadcasts! PS Vue displays a guide with many channels to choose from and comes with a DVR recorder so programs can be recorded and watched later. The amazing thing with Vue is you can go into the guide, pick a show that was aired, say, two hours ago that you missed and watch it in its entirety! The AFS gives you the tools you need to receive such programming.Another sweet thing about using the AFS for television viewing is no installer has to come to your house to set up your equipment and when you’re finished with their service nothing has to be returned. All you need is provided by the AFS. Also, no service contracts are required and services can be cancelled at any time with no penalties.I hope this was useful. Many of you took the time to write reviews and they were extremely helpful to me. I wanted to return the favor."
"4","I know why most of you are here. So before I get started, YES. The All-New Amazon Fire TV Stick DOES work with KODI. I repeat, you will STILL be able to sideload Kodi onto this device!Now that we have that incredibly important piece of information out of the way, I will start off by saying the All-New Amazon Fire TV Stick picks off where its ever so popular predecessor left off, offering you one of the most inexpensive ways to stream HOURS of content to your TV.The package itself includes:- The Fire TV Stick- The Remote control WITH Alexa voice control- A Power adapter- 2 AAA batteries (by Amazon basics)- an HDMI extender if the Fire TV Stick does not fit into your TV’s HDMI port.The device itself couldn’t be easier to use. Simply plug it into your TV, and you’re good to go! With this device, you’ll be able to use apps such as Netflix, Pandora, HBO, and even Amazon prime (provided you’re a prime member). You will of course need accounts for all of the previously mentioned apps, but if you do not, you can also use YouTube through this device, which has hours of content on it by itself! If you’re an Amazo Prime member, you will already have access to thousands of TV shows and Movies… just in case you didn’t know!The All New Amazon Fire TV Stick features some changes that are worth mentioning, but if you’re not too tech-savy, just know that this stick performs faster than the older model. This is due to a stronger processor, a 1.3ghz quad core processor vs a 1ghz dual core processor from older models. I WAS a bit disappointed to see that the All-New Fire TV Stick did not upgrade to 2gb of Ram. While 1gb is plenty for streaming in most cases, users may find occasional lag on the home screen, especially when first booting the device up. I’ve found that if I turn on my firestick, and go do something else for a few minutes, or just allow the device some time to boot up, I do not run into this issue. While there has not been an update in ram, I have noticed that navigating the fire stick is MUCH quicker than previous models, which will make anybody happy.Perhaps the biggest change from the previous Fire TV Stick is the remote control. While all of the buttons are the same, you now have a “Voice Control” button on top of the remote control. By pressing this button, you are allowed access to wide range of commands that take all of the grunt work out of browsing your streaming device. For instance, you can ask Alexa to “Find horror movies”, “play music from pandora”, “fast forward 5 minutes”, etc. This feature is ESPECIALLY useful given the difficulties surrounding the use of streaming devices with a remote control that doesn’t have a keyboard or mouse. It is also worth mentioning that the buttons are now made of a soft rubber material, and are easier to use.To conclude, If you’re looking for a portable, depdnable, and easy to use streaming device, this is it. At just under $40.00, It’s hard to say no to perhaps the least expensive streaming device on the market. While I do wish that this model featured 2gb of ram for quicker browsing, 1gb is plenty for what most people will be using this device for; streaming. All in all, I would very much recommend this device!IF you have any questions about this device, please feel free to comment. As somebody who uses Amazon almost daily, I’ll get back to you very shortly."
"5","I am SO GLAD I bought this Fire TV Stick with Alexa.  It has literally made my life happier.  As I write this review I'm listening to ""soft classic rock"".  All I had to do was say...""Play soft classic rock"" and music started playing.  For people like me who are elderly, tech illiterate, perhaps disabled, and who love music, movies, and TV shows, let me explain a few things.  I've been looking at this stick for some time now but was scared to buy it.  Then one day I said...the heck with it...I'm not stupid...I can read instructions...if it doesn't work for me I can send it back...I have nothing to lose and it's affordable.  So I purchased a fire stick...yea me...lol.This is NOT complicated to hook up AT ALL and there are very clear instructions that anyone can understand. The box you get includes power adapter, a cable, and extender cable, the fire stick, 2 batteries for the remote, and an Alexa Voice Remote.  It's as simple as can be.  First of all the instructions say the extender cable is to improve WiFi and remote performance so I used it.  Why not..better is always better..lol.  So...I plugged one end of the power cable into the power adapter and the other end of the cable into the fire stick.  Then I plugged the fire stick into the HDMI extender cable and then plugged that into the TV.  I have a wide screen Sanyo.  When you stick your head around the left side of our TV you see three places to plug ""things"" into. They're called ports...lol.  Mine are marked HDMI 1, 2, and 3.  I just plugged the stick into port HDMI 1. Last, I plugged the adapter into the wall socket and that was it. That's it.  THAT'S IT!!!!  That's ALL I had to do.  Read the short instructions to connect this fire stick. Turn on your TV and then follow the instructions that appear on your screen.  The Fire Stick does the rest.Obviously you can watch movies and TV shows as explained in the description but there's so much more.  Ask Alexa what the weather is for the day in your home town or where your kids live across the country.  I love music but somehow got away from listening to it over the years. Not anymore.  There's always music in our house now.  Just turn on the TV and tell Alexa what to play.  This time I pressed the button and said...""play soft rock"".  Alexa said...""here's a station that plays soft rock"".  The first station didn't appeal to me so I pressed the button again and said ""next"".  I got another soft classic rock station that's been playing for over an hour now. I've been listening to songs I used to love and haven't heard in a long time.  How I love ""Hotel California"". They call them stations but it only plays music...no commercials or chatter...one song plays after the other. Also a box shows on the screen that gives you the name of the song playing and the artist.  You can ask for any kind of music from classical, to rock, to alternative, to show tunes.I'm still learning.  I know there's more I can do with this and it will get easier to find exactly what I'm looking for as I play around with it.  I bought mine during the introductory promotion for the ""All-New"" version...think it was $29.95.  Now it's $10 more but still worth every cent.  Don't hesitate to buy it because you think it's too complicated.  They really made a good little device here and it's very easy to use for anyone who has a TV and WiFi which you probably have if you have a computer."
"6","I own both the new Fire and Roku stick (3600R), below is a short review and honest (personal) opinion on both products.User Interface: the Fire stick has essentially the same UI as Fire TV (which I also own), it is largely divided by content category (Home, Video, TV, Movie, Music, Games, Photo, Apps, etc.), and integrated seamlessly with Prime eco-system. If you are already a Prime member, you will have better experience with Fire stick than Roku. Roku’s UI has the advantage of integrating more contents (Google Store, My Feed, News, etc.). Roku also allows user to make certain changes in Home screen (add/remove/move tiles), unlike Fire stick. However, both UIs are well designed, smooth. It comes down to personal preference.Hardware/Streaming Quality: as far as I can tell, there isn’t much difference, both are powerful devices, almost no lags with either device. One of the attached pictures is a screenshot of streaming YouTube 4K content from Fire stick, the picture quality is stunning (output as 1080p).Remote: I personally like the Fire remote, it is simple (only 7 buttons with a navigation ring), but provides all the functions you will need. I find it is both slimmer and easier to use than the Roku remote. In addition, Fire remote has a voice function, which you won’t find on Roku, this is a big plus. Also note that the Fire stick remote will work with Fire TV but you will have to ""unpair"" it first (please see the comment made by RoadDog on this review).Voice Search/Alexa: Amazon has greatly improved the search function. One of the main complains of earlier versions of Fire TV/Stick is that Alexa only search Amazon contents, but not 3rd parties’ (Netflix, etc.). However, with the latest software update, the search results now show both Amazon and 3rd party. You can choose from multiple ways to watch a movie (and whether the option is free of charge is clearly indicated).Power Cord: the USB cable came with Fire stick is about 4 feet long, it also comes with an adapter. However, I am using a 3rd party wall charger (iClever BoostCube+ 30W Dual USB Wall Charger with Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0), and it worked well. In one of the pictures you can see the Fire charger output = 5.0V + 1.0A, iClever output is sufficient. It is a benefit in case you travel a lot, so that you won’t need to bring two separate chargers. One charger with two output slots will be enough for both your phone and Fire stick.App Quality: one of the main reasons that I bought the Fire stick after I bought Roku is because the quality of Playstation Vue app on Fire system is MUCH better than Roku, from my experience there is simply no comparison. Vue app on Fire gives you much easier access to your recorded shows, live programming schedule and channel switching. Roku doesn’t have live programming schedule, and some of my recorded shows are missing. However, quality of other main apps (Netflix, YouTube, ESPN, etc.) are more or less on par between Fire and Roku.Price: Fire stick is ~$9 cheaperHotel/Travel log-in: with Roku, you will need a separate mobile device (phone) to connect to a specific WiFi network established by the stick, then open up a browser and log in (normally with room# and last name). Often it took me several tries to establish the connection. With Fire stick, no need for a separate device, you will go to ""Settings/System/Network"" and press the ""option"" button on the remote, an on-screen cursor would appear, which allows you to log in as if you are using a laptop. I found the ""Fire"" way simpler and more intuitive.Physical Appearance: in fact, this is the only category I’d put Roku on top of Fire stick. The new Fire stick (1.2 x 3.4in) is much larger than Roku (you can see from the picture), it is even larger than the first generation Fire stick. This really surprised me as I thought the trend is to make them smaller. I also prefer that Roku put the power slot at the end of stick, while Fire stick put it right in the middle, which is really awkward.In short, if you are a Prime member and use Playstation Vue, I’d highly recommend the new Fire stick."
"7","Set this up for a friend and found it very simple. It attaches to the amazon account that purchased it initially. So i created her an amazon account and was able to link it to her new account instead. All i had to do was pug it into the back of the tv (i had to use the little extender because there wasn't enough room at the back for it to sit next to the other HDMI plug), then plug it into a power source and switch the TV input. Then the screen prompted me to choose the network, enter internet password, and so on.  You will need to have a form of payment on file to download any ""apps"", even if they are free... Just so you know. You will not be charged anything to use this product, there is a lot of free content, but should you want to purchase it is easier for everyone if there is already a card on file so you can watch immediately.Very impressed with ease of use, worth the wait for it to arrive. Friend loves it! She is not tech savvy at all, but with practice is working her way through the jw broadcasting app and really enjoying the programming.Another side note, I noticed some borders (top and bottom) were cut off on her tv screen, including the top menus. If this happens to you, it can be changed by adjusting the display settings on your actual TV. In her case, I left as is because she liked the way her screen displayed on the regular for tv and movies. She has just memorized which tab goes to which content, and if all else fails, just click it and see and if its not what you want, click the next one, right?Also the Alexa feature is nice to pull up any app!!Hope this was helpful for anyone wondering about purchasing this or setting it up"
"8","We have two of these fire sticks in our home so far, and we are extremely pleased with them. Eliminating cable and streaming instead has been life altering in an amazing way for us, in our family of four. By far, I would rate this the greatest, and most used gadget we have purchased.Since this works off of wifi and internet, yes you will have those occasional little spurts and lags you get with any internet connection and streaming devices, but as a whole this great little stick has performed over and over again for us also making it the best gadget for a family on a budget.If you're new to concept of this, or on the fence, trust that it is not in any way difficult and you will successfully set it up, and love it!"
"9","The 1st generation firestick had an option to calibrate/resize the picture so that the edges don't get cut off.  The 2nd generation firestick adds ""Alexa"" as a new feature, but they also took away the option to calibrate/resize the picture.  Instead that screen says to adjust your TV so that the picture fits.  My TV has absolutely no display setting that is compatible with the firestick!  So I am stuck with the edges of the screen being cut off.  Reading a bunch of forums about this where other people complain about the same issue, evidently Amazon was aware of this issue at least 9 months ago and they told customers that they were going to release a fix for this problem in an upcoming release.  Well 9 months later, there still is no fix for this problem, despite the fact that they did release new firmware, which basically re-arranged the menus on the firesick from the left to the top..  This picture size issue won't affect everybody because every TV renders the screen differently, and I'd like to believe that most TVs may be able to resize the screen after you go through the menus on the TV so that the video signal from the firestick fits the screen.  But I have a TV made by Sharp that just won't fit the screen properly from the firestick.  The people who make the Firestick certainly had to have known that this would be an issue, because they had the feature to calibrate/resize the picture in the 1st generation firestick.  Why is that useful and nescessary feature missing on this 2nd generation firestick?  So I give it ONE STAR... until Amazon pushes out new firmware that fixes this problem."
"10","This was purchased as a gift but i also own one myselfThis is s 85.9mm by 30mm by 12.6mm stick that plugs into the HDMI port on your TV, and if it's already registered to your Amazon account, there's little to do other than switch it on and connect it to your Wi-Fi router.The Fire TV Stick is n example of turning dumb machines into smarter ones: the TV which I tested the Fire Stick on is at least seven years old from my college days, 19 inches, and wasn't top-of-the-range even then.The Fire Stick can't do much about the quality of the display but it does make my old TV smart enough to prolong its life by a year or two, maybe even longer, by allowing me to use video streaming services like Amazon's Prime Video and other services like Netflix and HULU.The Fire version of the Alexa service is launched by holding down the microphone button on the remote control and making a request.And because the TV -- unlike the Echo, which i also own- has a screen, you'll get more information, or at least a bit of text, with your weather forecast and other skills.For those who already use streaming​ video services, the voice control is a fun addition with plenty of potentials.-I hope you find this review helpful--- Sandra Awodele-"
"11","Great product..several pre-installed apps and tons to download. If youre looking for a cheaper alternative to satellite/cable tv, this may be it.  If you have a Roku, this is essentially the same thing with a different name and interface.  Im not sure exactly what other differences there are but theyre likely minor.  They both function practically the same.  Just make sure if you have a big household and you want to use more than one of these (or similar) devices at the same time, that you have sufficient bandwidth.  They have recommendations, but Im sure 30mbps for 2 of these should be enough for simultaneous 1080p streaming.Now why did I take off a star?  The REMOTE.  Its sleek, yes, but a bit TOO sleek.  When you attempt to install the batteries, the back of the remote is INSANELY difficult to remove.  Usually, remotes or other devices have a small slot or tab where you could stick your fingernail in and pry off the door/back.  This has neither.  Theres a hollow ""dip"" where you can put your thumb(s) to slide the door down, but its still very difficult to do.  Horrible, novice design by Amazon and Im sure theyve heard feedback on it by now.  Yes it was that frustrating that I took a star off.  Of course, the difficulty will vary from person to person, but for me it was a headache."
"12","We had a Fire TV stick version 1 for quite a while and it worked great. With voice remote, it would be even better. Or so we thought.We tried everything to get the voice remote to work with our HDTVs and existing wifi router, but there was no way to resolve the issue; we worked with customer service for several hours over several days. Nothing they suggested worked. I reinstalled the version 1 unit.I had already decided to upgrade my router and cable modem but wasn't interested in buying over $100 of equipment to solve a problem with a $40 device. In due time I bought the new router and replaced the cable modem. All of my devices connected without issue.When I tried the version 2 Fire TV stick - the voice remote worked as advertised. I initially believed the problem to be a server issue but it appears to have been a bandwidth problem. As I was able to buy the router on Balck Friday at a discount, the Fire TV stick ver 2 and the router came in at the original price of the router alone, I'm happy."
"13","I purchased this with one thing in mind, my frustrations. I have just about every gadget and doodad imaginable, it’s electronic overload over here. That being said, I was super annoyed with having to air play from my iPad to my Apple TV, and the lag time was frustrating - sometimes things wouldn’t even load at all. Another big reason for my purchase was that I didn’t want to have to login to my Chromebook to rent a movie from Amazon Video... I wanted the ability to rent instantly, and now I can! The apps are more extensive than Apple TV so far, I purchased this one at a great Cyber Monday deal for $24.99, and the voice automated feature is pretty cool but I will say it is kind of annoying that you have to hold a button to use voice control but this is fairly minor and will probably be fixed in generations down the line. I’ve had smart TVs with Apple TV, Chromecast, Blu-Ray smart apps, etc. but so far none of them beat this stick. The best part? There is no learning curve at all, and just took me under ten minutes to setup from start to finish!"
"14","I know why most of you are here. So before I get started, YES. The All-New Amazon Fire TV Stick DOES work with KODI.

As somebody who uses Amazon almost daily, I’ll get back to you very shortly."
"15","What can I say? I LOVE my Fire TV Stick - But I HATE Spectrum's lousy UBEE modem with built in Wi-Fi. I called them up and they agreed something was amiss with my two Wi-fi signals. I was told to bring the modem to their office location for a swap out. They gave me an even newer version of their UBEE modem with internal Wi-Fi. I was happy. Happy until I tried to stream Netflix and Amazon Video over the 5gb signal. Within a half hour I can ""Connection with problems"" as my Fire TV Stick likes to call Spectrum's connation. I've had to keep jumping from 2.4 to 5 every half hour or less just to watch a two hour film. If you're here to buy a Fire TV Stick you should also pick up your own Wi-Fi router - I've read that Google has a new one that can't be beat."
"16","Having the previous version of Fire TV Stick and hoping the new Firestick TV with Alexa was going to make everything ""hands free"", I'm disappointed. First, voice searching is confusing. When making a request, some commands work and others are either ignored (start, pause, resume videos) or Alexa says she can't do it. Second, when searching, I get confused which app I'm in (eg, in Amazon Store, I asked for a item and I get video suggestions from Amazon Prime Video.) Grantedl, there are added features that are useful but the learning curve is so steep, I'm frustrated and disappointed at the same time. If wasn't for the sale price, I would not have switched from the previous Firestick"
"17","I have 3 of these and have had no issues at all.  I use the stick for Netflix, DirectTV Now, and Prime Video.  I like how easy it is to setup and the remove works well.  I have had no buffering issues when streaming video.  I do have a mesh wireless network in the house which improves coverage and streaming, and I have 200mb Xfinity internet.  The Fire TV Stick is always response when moving around the menus.  For the price, this is a great way to stream video to any HDMI TV.  I like how I could, if I wanted to, take this on a trip without issue."
"18","So, I have both a Chromecast and a Fire TV stick. Coming from an avid Google fan and a previous proponent of the Chromecast, I have to say that I am loving the Fire TV stick. I would say the main difference is: you do not need a separate device to cast from, which makes everything just a little easier. For example, I usually use my phone to cast Netflix onto my Chromecast and for whatever reason, seeking (rewinding by sliding the play bar) is unnecessarily difficult and inaccurate. The Amazon Fire TV is a little more expensive, but it must be because it has everything built in and has its own remote, which means you don't need a phone, laptop, or tablet to use or control the applications and menus. I never realized how annoying casting was was until I got the Fire TV with the handy remote, which also brings me to compatibility with Amazon Echo. I just purchased the Echo Dot and although the hands-free voice control for Fire TV is a nifty feature, I think the physical remote is the most practical when on the couch. It's another matter entirely when you forget to pause before you casually wander to the kitchen, in which case, you can call out to Alexa and she has your absent minded back :)"
"19","I was really excited to try this... Unfortunately the remote will not power on..tried new batteries and all the troubleshooting possible. Amazon said it is rare but does happen once in awhile and said they would replace it with next day shipping.. but when I checked my orders...it shows as not being shipped for another week. And no...no discounts for inconvenience or having to wait for a working one. So as it stands...I have a NON WORKING FIRE STICK and hopefully get a working device 2 weeks after ordering.I will change my review of the product if the next one I get actually works...if I ever get it."
"20","I've been putting off buying a smart tv because my current one is still in perfect condition. I came across this product during the Black Friday sales and decided to give it a shot. I love it! I can watch Netflix on my tv which was my main goal. I also love that I can watch Prime shows, which I've been neglecting. It was easy to install. The only thing I didn't like was that it needs to be connected to a power outlet and there isn't one close enough, but I made it work. Very affordable compared to the price of upgrading to a smart tv."
"21","It is rare to hear about a product that lives up to the hype, but this is definitely one that does. I am so happy I bought this! So easy to set up and a much clearer connection than I had been getting using a cable from my computer or a connection through my wii. I'm a little mystified by the absence of an on/off switch, but it always seems to work, and it's fun to just talk to it and see how well it can follow my commands. This was recommended by a friend, and I'd like to pass that recommendation along. Not even expensive!"
"22","Upgraded from previous generation Fire stick that did not have voice remote. This fire stick is much faster and the added voice remote is nice (plus this Fire stick works with Alexa). We are big fans of the fire stick devices because they work with so many different services and the UI is good as well (especially for those with Amazon Prime). Our main uses for this device are Playstation Vue, CW app, Netflix, and of course Amazon Prime Video."
"23","So I bought this for my 95 year old grandfather who always says their is 900 channels and nothing on. He likes westerns, so I gave him a crash course in how to to use the fire stick and surprisingly he has picked it up pretty well. Now he can watch all the new and different series or western he wants. I like that I can also watch Netflix or HBOgo on it as well, essentially turning a non smart TV into a smart TV."
"24","Really like this unit. I recently decided to cut the cable from Dish Network. Their prices were headed towards the sky, so I bought this Firestick to replace it.Since I needed to replace Dish, Directv Now was perfect for us. I got their largest package for $70.00. I we get almost every channel we always watched. I did also already have Amazon Prime so we get a bunch of movies and shows."
"25","I got one since they were on sale and needed another one for a TV in the basement.  I have 3 Roku's but wanted to see how the Fire Stick was and now I wish I had all Fire Sticks.  I like that I can get apps right from the menu unlike Roku where I have to go to my phone.  Not a big issue either way but just a little more convenient.  I really like it because the layout of some of the Apps I use are a lot better then with the Roku (Playstation Vue for one)."
"26","So I had the Roku for a long time as a matter of fact it was the first gen 720p one, and as long as it wasn't broken I wasn't worried about when it stopped upgrading and not showing Netflix at all I knew it was time to try something new so I upgraded to the Fire TV Stick and I have loved every moment of!!!!!! When we upgrade to a 4K TV we will be getting the 4K Amazon Fie set top box!!!!"
"27","Talk about a game changer!  We were having to use our old xbox 360 to watch digital tv.  We bought the fire stick after a few friends suggested it and boy are we impressed.  So impressed we bought a second!  We love how easy it is to use and how  my younger child can use the voice controls to put on shows since he can't use the controller properly."
"28","Really easy to install, makes every tv seem like a smart tv. The apps that update do not take long, I never have a space issue either. I have had it for a year now and I can gladly say this product did not disappoint. Worth every cent. Has plenty of games for fun as well as educational games for kids!!"
"29","Purchased in Nov 2016 but am having problems with the remote as of Mar 2017 and I hardly use it! Otherwise, I love it. Will seek to return it and will update my experience."
"30","This crazy thing turns the TV on when there is no one in the room!  It happens in the middle of the night and wakes us up.  I don't like to leave the house with this thing.In addition, we will be watching regular cable TV and this thing suddenly turns on by itself.  Right in the middle of the most dramatic moment, of course!  Then it's a big production to shift back to cable and get back to the program we were watching.I like the older version much better."
"31","fathers day gift, went over wonderfully. while he does not use the voice aspect, this gave my father the ability to watch netflix in his bedroom. hes not getting the full use out of this but its still perfect for what he needed. only bad thing i can say is that while being a prime member, this was ordered before fathers day and not shipped until after, and i was sent 2 instead of 1. not the end of the world but having this shipped on time would have made our fathers day gathering a bit better/"
"32","I'd give it a 10 if I could!  I guess I never really knew what the Fire Stick was about until I talked to a techy friend, so I ordered it.  Took it out of the box last night and within 1 minute I was in business.  So neat.  I love the Alexa feature......I never knew what I was missing.  So EASY to set up too.  So worth the money."
"33","Love the product and the versatility it provides and looking to cancel cable once our contract is up. The only things my I didn't like about the entire process is that UPS delivered it late :( UPS seems to always deliver my packages late and if I'm paying for prime two-day shipping, I expect to get just that. Anyways, another topic for another day! I love the stick and might just buy an extra for the guest bedroom."
"34","Alexa integration is not perfect, you can't search in the apps.  How cool would it be if you said play ______ and it found it in your Plex library or your prime library (or which ever app you own it in) and started playing it!  Now it just takes you to a rental page so you can rent it. I am sure with each update it will get better, but for the price you can't go wrong."
"35","I'm just streaming movies and mini series as fast as I can ... lol!!  I'm very pleased with the Fire Stick, it makes streaming a breeze.  Amazon's selection is on-going and I'm sure it will just get better.  I'm new to the Alexa commands, but having fun with it ... I think it might spoil me!!  Thanks Amazon for a great product!!"
"36","Love this product. As a truck driver it allows me to watch tv in my truck without buying a expensive dish. Thru this little device, I can watch Prime movies and also add Netflix, showtime, Hulu  to my app section. I can also add bluetooth speaker directly to the Stick. (My tv's speakers suck) To me, this is well worth the price."
"37","The death of cable TV!! I absolutely love my Fire Stick with Alexa Voice Remote. I previously did not use the Amazon Instant Video feature that comes with a Prime account, but that has all changed with the addition of the Fire Stick. It is an amazing device that is easy to use and comes with many features and apps (including the amazon instant video). While I do not use a ton of the other apps, it is an amazing device that you can customize to your watching needs (you can use it with Hulu, Netflix, prime, starz, HBO to name a few). The Alexa remote gives you a bunch of the features that you could with an Echo (you can ask it questions like what the forecast will be). In addition you can connect it with Bluetooth speakers! I travel a fair amount on business and always bring my Fire Stick with me. Well worth the money (also very affordable)!"
"38","Seems to work well.  The good: I purchased this item because my Samsung Smart TV's network card failed after 2 1/2 yrs.  This item allowed me to have my Samsung work with the wifi.  (Repair of the network card or replacement of a wifi receiver that works with the Samsung did not seem a viable alternative.)  The bad: The disappointment is the apparent paucity of free apps."
"39","Works well and as expected.  One down side is that when it first receives power it connects to Amazon and uses up all available bandwidth while it downloads...something?  If it's on all the time, not a problem.  But, if you plug it in occasionally, it's  a quirk to be prepared for.  Especially if you use a hotspot while mobile."
"40","I bought a Samsung HDTV in 2013. It had a 40"" Screen. I hsve it in my Condo in Maui. I also purchased late last year a 70"" 4K UHD for my home in Southern California. I was able to watch Prime Video on the newer larger screen at home. I most admit that from time to time maintaining a steady good picture was trying.  When I got to Maui this year, I was surprised to see that this unit was unable to download, stream , or see any Prime Video. I purchased a Fire Stick with remote, at a reasonable $39.99 and amazed at the Quality of the video on my older Samsung. So much so that when I return home shortly I an taking my Fire Stick with me and making it a permanent part of both of my Samsungs HDTV, 1080p, and 4K,,  Highly recommended if you are experiencing any problems with getting Amazon Video up and running on your HDTV,,,,"
"41","Good by cable.....works great....will be getting more"
"42","I've been having issues with it falling asleep while I'm actively watching a show, so I tried to change the settings and wasn't impressed by the options. It's an all or nothing seems like; either remove the sleep setting completely or risk it timing out during any program longer than 15 mins. This is incredibly minor. Otherwise, I've loved it so far. Easy to use!"
"43","Love my Firestick. Always had an Apple TV but like this more. It has Youtube built in which Apple TV does not, unless you mirror but that doesnt always connect like it should. I like to listen to music using You Tube. The Firestick is small and works even with my weak internet connection. I'm impressed. Easy to set up and use."
"44","The Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote is good product, changed our TV viewing experience on our older flat screen TV, however I am surprised that of all the APPS available the VUDU app is not included. Contacted Amazon Customer Service and was told that the VUDU App would not work with the Fire TV Stick, did not state why though. Would recommend the product for updating older TV units bringing them up to the digital age, I just hope that the VUDU App will be available for the Fire TV Stick very soon."
"45","I have two other Fire Sticks and the is the only one with Alexa Voice.  This Fire Stick arrived on time and I had it connected and streaming off the internet in just a few minutes.  This unit works great as expected.  By the way, I have placed the unit on a smart TV since there are greater available apps from Amazon. I like the Alexa feature."
"46","Best thing since peanut butter on slice bread!!!  We have four in the house.  Even better since they added BritBox to the apps.  Checked into dropping cable but they way it is all bundled, we would not save.  Hardly ever turn on regular tv except for local news and weather. No complaints at all except the range.  It will not pick up in the far bedroom from internet connection.  Too many walls I think.  I have had no trouble setting them up and I am only fairly computer savy."
"47","Being technology dinosaurs we have resisted streaming as a way to receive our visual entertainment. My wife's 71 year old cousin went nuts about Fire Stick and we decided to try it. We had our 16 year old grandson set it up and we are thrilled. Can't believe we waited so long. We did belong to Netflix's DVD club but now we are enjoying their streaming membership. Thanks for a great addition to our entertainment options."
"48","I've been using Apple TV for years now. Now that I have the Fire Stick, it's my default go to for movies, music and general entertainment. The movies are better picture quality and with the voice remote, it's much easier to use at half the price of the Apple TV. If you're thinking about picking up one these, don't wait any longer."
"49","I pre ordered the first fire stick and have been happy with it all along, no complaints. The new voice remote is even better, the voice recognition with Alexa is amazing. I don't know what's inside the stick, but the movies pop up a lot faster, and now there's no need to spend time typing in a movie. Just ask and there it is."
"50","I know it's early, but this is the best thing I ever purchased on Amazon. Kindle is second. I'm a prime member, and thought it just O.K. but when you put them all together-it's the perfect package.A few years ago, I looked into ""cutting the cable"". The bills got higher and the content less. Network news got partisan. with tragedies and wars they were only concerned with who got kicked off ""Dancing with the Stars"" last night. (not that that's a bad thing)Prime membership is cheaper than any discount cable (not to mention all the other benefits like music, books, and free shipping). the Kindles and Fire Stick are a one time inexpensive purchase.With thousands of books, albums, and video to choose from for under $10 dollars a month, how could one go wrong.Now I just have to avoid in-app purchases."
"51","I've been looking into different streaming devices for awhile now and I own a Roku express.By far the firestick out performs the Roku, the speed, quality and ease of use is so much better on a firestick, plus it's Bluetooth so I don't have to point the remote directly at the device.It hooks directly into a hdmi slot and is well hidden, it comes with everything you need right outa the box, even comes with batteries and a extension for your hdmi just in case the fire stick won't fit your tv, also comes with an hdmi cable.This is a must have! It had a ton of apps!"
"52","This is great! This does everything it says it does. I enjoy free movies from Amazon Prime with this. The voice remote makes it quick and easy to find whatever show or movie you're looking for. Netflix and Hulu also give you a free 30 day trial, then each is just $7.99/month. You do have to have internet for your TV for this to work."
"53","I have long been a ROKU fan because it was the only set-top box you could find without a bias against other content providers since they are not a content provider.The lack of updates to the excruciatingly slow YouTube app on the ROKU has been a thorn in my side for a long time.Once I discovered the Fire TV Stick would not only run YouTube but also Netflix, PlayStationVUE, Pluto, TWiT, and of course Amazon Video and Music, as well as apps from many other content providers, it was an easy decision.Kudos to Amazon for being confident enough in their offerings to allow other content providers onto their platform.As I also have an Amazon Dot which I really like, I have to remind myself the Fire TV Stick has an Alexa interface as well.I think Amazon has hit the ball out of the park with this one."
"54","Very happy with the stick,At first I was hesitant because it does not support 4k,because its a stick and not an android tvbut after having a bad experience with an android tv device I gave it a shot,guess what-I got a remote with alexa-bluetooth support to listen to my content in private if needed-wifi 2.4 and 5ghz support to get an even better speed and range for your internet- installed kodi to get all the channels that werent available-all others apps are a breez on this device and it works flawlessly"
"55","Easy set up, just have your wifi network password handy and your Amazon account signin.  Fast and better than expected.  I'm still learning how to use the 'voice control'... I think I have to 'hold' the button while I 'say my command', i keep letting go to soon.  Works better than my older Roku.  Very happy with my purchase."
"56","This thing is fantastic! I was a Chromecast user for quite some time, but Amazon sees to it that their video services don't play well with Chromecast. But I'm very pleased with the Firestick. It's more responsive and easier to navigate than Chromecast. I highly recommend this if you like to stream Hulu, YouTube, Netflix,  HBO,etc. This thing does it all."
"57","Not sure I like it better than the ROKU we use on another TV...I could easily access MSNBC and CNN on that one...just seemed easier.  But...it is still nice to access movies and other clear HD stations on a TV that is used in the guest room without requiring cable there."
"58","I love it - it is so easy to use and better than the Original Fire TV Stick - it just opens up a whole new world, at a time when we need it so much what with all of the hate and ill will on the regular network tvs.  Alexa does not seem to have a problem understanding my southern accent like Siri does and that is a definite plus."
"59","I love it. I live in an area where no internet is offered by phone company. I cannot use satellite because of no southwest sky location because of timber around me blocks my view. I’m down under a mountain which creates a worse problem. Tried the fire stick and won’t ever change because now I have direct tv now and other shows and networks if I ever need them without the big cost of satellite or cable service if provided which are not. Now with my wireless provider and my amazon fire stick I have everything I want without about 90% less cost of all other tv services with big cost. Would highly recommend it and oh by the way you can carry it with you everywhere you go and I really like that because my husband and I are truck drivers. 100% satisfied!"
"60","At 66, I was able to get this up and running fairly easily.  I did have to turn off and on our wireless router to get the process started.  It feels like we just joined the 21st century.  When showing my husband how it works, I pushed the microphone to talk and said, Luciano Pavarotti, his picture appeared and I was prompted to play music for free with my Amazon Prime.  Just speak the name of a type of film you want to see or a TV show and up it comes up and you can see which you can rent, which you can buy and which you can watch for free with your Amazon Prime membership (which I highly recommend, by the way).  With Prime, there is a ton of free content.  We will be discontinuing our paid services on our cable like HBO because everything costs less through this product.  Amazing and so much fun.  If you don't have one, get one!"
"61","works great .....happy to have it."
"62","The Fire TV stick with Alexa voice remote is great! Go back, forward, start over and search using simple voice commands is awesome. The remote is very simple to use too. The updated on screen interface is better but I'm hoping it continues to improve. I'd like to see all the services I already own listed first then offer the additional cost selections. I feel like I'm constantly being SOLD something new. It's very frustrating when you find something you want to watch and it's an additional cost. Where is all the Prime content? I'm finding very limited content on Prime. I'm still spending way more time on NetFlix.Enjoy some great flavored nuts while you watch you movies or relax and listen to music.Honey Toasted Cashews - Rich Full Cashew Crunch and Flavor Wrapped in a Delicately Sweet Honey Coating (8 oz)"
"63","I bought one for my bedroom TV and loved it so much, I bought another for the living room, replacing the Apple TV controller I had. So easy to set up and use. I subscribe to Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Netflix, and there's plenty of great movies and shows to watch on there that I hardly ever watch the regular networks any more."
"64","LOVE IT!! GREATEST INVENTION YET!! I HAVE TWO, BUT LOST REMOTE TO ONE OF THEM... REMOTE WORKS FOR JUST ONE FIRE TV STICK. BOTH ARE DIFFERENT TYPES, ONE I BOUGHT RIGHT WHEN CAME OUT (LOST REMOTE), SECOND, I JUST BOUGHT LAST MONTH... THINKING OF JUST BUYING ANOTHER FIRE STICK?!BUT YES... A DEFINITE TEN STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"65","This had got to be one of the best purchases I ever made! I don't know why I didn't get one sooner! I would cancel my cable if I could,  but my provider insists just purchasing Internet is more expensive. I literally just plugged the USB into my TV and got started with the Fire Stick right away. It's not difficult to learn,  which can often be the case with new technology. As a Prime member,  I have access to a variety of TV shows and movies. I love that I can use apps,  such as Pandora, through the fire stick! I also took advantage of the Netflix free trial and am now a loyal customer! I highly recommend the new Fire Stick,  and the price is excellent for such a great product! I actually didn't expect much from it because of the low price,  but I was pleasantly surprised. I haven't had any issues with it freezing, or skipping,  or anything!"
"66","Being the only one with cable at work, i decided to buy a firestick, I am glad I did. At times streaming is slow because of too many internet usage on many devices. I will be saving money... for once!In addition my 8 yo uses it all the time for his shows and youtube. I will be buying a few more, dont like sharing :)"
"67","Excellent remote. It starts my TV, and takes me wherever I want and I can name the program (in Netflix, Amazon Video, etc.) by using a voice command. Only thing missing is that I cannot adjust the volume with it. I am giving it 5 stars because of its quality. I hope that they will add the volume control in a future update. Strongly recommended."
"68","Excellent item although the batteries in the remote went dead after just 5 minutes of using it.  I thought the unit froze-up but after spending an hour or longer turning my TV on & off and unplugging the Fire Stick & plugging it back in I finally went to YouTube and found that quite a few people were having the same problem and eventually replaced their batteries in the remote and everything was fine after that. So thankfully I just purchased some new batteries the previous day.  Everything is fine with the unit but the Instructions with the unit are absolutely Useless.  I guess if you are a computer nerd the instructions work somewhat well.  There are absolutely no instructions on how to navigate the programs once you get to them.  Plus there is No Written Instructions on How To Turn the Damn Thing Off or On for that matter."
"69","This Fire Stick is much better than my old one. Very user friendly. Easy to set up. Excellent quality streaming. I can tell a big difference between this one and my old one, with the same internet connection even. Plus it's cool talking to Alexa. She's a sweet chick, especially when you're too lazy to press buttons yourself."
"70","I had the Amazon Fire in one room and decide do get the new Amazon First TV stick for my living room and I'm glad I did.  It still has all the same features, but I can notice an improvement in performance and speed.  It's great for apps as well as streaming all of the excellent Prime content (all the better to watch Mozart in the Jungle)"
"71","I am trying to downsize my satellite bills, so I decided to try this. the only problem is everything you decide to try, you have to download the app and it starts out free, then when you go into it, they all want to start charging you for all the programs in it. we added some of the outside programs and they work out a lot better."
"72","Received this as a Christmas gift from my brother. I followed the instructions to the letter and it works perfectly. I set it up to go to my amazon prime account, input my Wifi password and it worked perfectly the first time. I then unplugged it and plugged it into my husbands TV which is in an entertainment center and it works just fine. In fact we've watched two Amazon Prime movies already. The only thing I don't like, you're limited as to how many items you can put on your watchlist. Nowhere can I find information on exactly how many shows you can add, but beware as you're in adding things to your watchlist and then you go back and find things you added are no longer there, that's why. I have searched many blogs and seen the same complaint, but no responses. Small issue for me and not enough to take it down from a 5 star."
"73","nice to talk to Alexa and she get's right to the business so I like it definitely a step up from Chromecast I really like the fire stick I just need to jail break some other variety of movies I actually like horror movies and classic tearjerkers. So while I using my new Singer sewing machine that I purchased from Amazon I watch my fire stick movies good job Amazon you rocccck!!!~!"
"74","I have only had it a week so I am still different things to do with the Firestick but I love it. The picture is amazing. It is very simple to install. You are given many choices of Wi-Fi types and you just choose yours. Next the password screen comes. Next your trying to figure out what you want to watch. Worth every penny!!!"
"75","I got rid of mg ps4 because I had no use for it anymore I can watch movies from Amazon prime I can use my Hulu and Nexflix account so I so happy with my purchase u should have done this year's ago and the picture quality is excellent I love my fire stick I recommend everyone in the world to get one the possibilities are endless u will be entertained from the moon and back I would give it 50 stars if i could"
"76","This was very easy to install. Easy to use. I am already a Prime member and have a Netflix membership so I don't ever see running out of things to watch. I use this in my bedroom where I only watch a little tv at night before I go to sleep. I was so happy to return the obnoxious little box I had to rent for $7 a month from Comcast just to get a few basic tv channels that I never liked anyway."
"77","Love it, super fast and small. Only complaint is that the remote connection is pretty bad. Needs to have a better wireless connection. Because the stick goes BEHIND the tv in the hdmi port, it’s connection is a little blocked but it works if you’re close enough to the tv. Other than that it’s great. Fix the remote Amazon!"
"78","Amazon Fire TV / Fire Stick is excellent when loaded with the ""right app builds"". Look for a "" liteweigt "" (low memory, processor usage build/apps), a lot of the user made apps available are not useful on a Fire Stick, they use entirely too much memory and requires too much processing power, find a great ""lite"" build/apps and you will love this thing."
"79","This is a great little device!  I never used my Netflix account because it was a pain to get to my Wii, which is how I connected to Netflix previously.  Alexa helps me find movies that I would like.  Also, if I want to watch something from my Prime playlist, Alexa will help me out with that too!If you're on the fence about getting this, get off and order it!"
"80","Don't know why but it will only work on the TV it was originally set up on. I changed my mind and moved it to another TV in my house but I couldn't get it to work so I returned it to the original TV where it works perfectly. It only came with a quick set up instruction card so I don't know if I'm doing something wrong? ? ?"
"81","I recieved this free for signing up with DirectTV Now. There were quite a few bad reviews of the DirectTV Now application so I was apprehensive of where the problem rested; was it a hardware problem with the Fire TV Stick or was it a software problem.My Fire Stick is connected to my TP Link AC router, a great router, using the 5 Ghz radio. It works great and I have no problem receiving DirectTV Now or any other channel on the Fire Stick. My positive experience has led me to the conclusion that the problems stated in other reviews may be due to the speed of the wifi connections being used. While I'm positive on the Fire TV Stick, I have to ding DirectTV Now for being dependent on a fast wifi network for its streaming service. Most people have 2.4 Ghz routers so DirectTV Now should be optimized to work with them."
"82","We cut the cable and got a fire stick. Paired with Sling TV we couldn't be happier. Goodby bloated cable bill and Hello to an extra $100 dollars a month spent, or saved, more intelligently"
"83","I have never owned anything close to one of these so I was very skeptical..And for starters I paid for this myself, and this is my own personal review..I hate reviews that are made up, paid for, or compensated for.Item was packaged well. Upon opening it was self explanatory of what went where, but I followed the directions for once in my life.Plugged the fire stick into one of my tv's and went thru all the steps. I then signed into my accounts I have and it was good to go.It provides a very clear and great picture, so many things to choose from such as tv shows, movies, music :), and apps..I am very satisfied with my purchase and may buy another for my shop tv..Even though this is portable."
"84","My third purchase for the house. Second one was sent back because the remote was defective. Went through tech supports directions even though I knew it was defective. (Had to take batteries out  each time I had selected a button!) I'm not that technically stupid, but followed their directions anyhow. Still a Great product!"
"85","I absolutely love it! We had gotten rid of our cable as they wanted 100  bucks a month for basic cable! So, we bought antennas, didn't work to well-we already had Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime but it was always freezing, buffering or just not playing. Once we got the stick all that changed-we can now watch hours of CSI, OITNB and Prime Videos with no problem!!"
"86","I already have a  Fire Stick for the living room.  So I decided to treat myself to one for my room.  I have to remind myself that it has the Alexa voice option.  It's nice to have a quicker way to get to some of my shows especially if I'm tired and don't have my glasses nearby.  I know at first I thought ""how lazy have I become?""  But having that option is nice at the end of a very busy day.  I'm very pleased with this product.  I like how quick and easy it is to hook up and start using."
"87","I was truly torn on whether I should or should not buy Fire TV for months and whether I needed it.I can tell you I am so glad I did !  I truly enjoy the options Fire TV Stick has provided especially at Christmas when the holiday classics are a tradition in our family.If Prime does not have it, Fire TV Stick will find who does have it via other providers such as Netflix etc..Fire TV Stick has a short term goal of cutting way back on my cable and a long term goal of leaving cable for good.I am not a big TV watcher and Fire TV Stick allows me the flexibility to watch what I want when I want...Pro's1) Diversity2) Price3) Ease of Setup4) ""Take it with you"" MobilityCons1) None Identified since Thanksgiving purchase (I will update in 6 months)"
"88","As for turning my HDMI ported ‘dumb’ TV into a smart TV, it works great. The shows that are available are up to individual tastes. If you like older movies, or missed one a couple years ago that you wanted to see, it’s good for that. My question is, all the talk about ‘jailbreaking’ one, which just in the term alone sounds quite illegal (though some say ’nah, not really’). I already had a Netflix account that I now stream, but the Amazon Prime looks pretty good too “At an added cost”. In conclusion, I have an opportunity I did not have prior to purchasing this device, the device does work extremely well, it is reasonably priced and (in my opinion) it’s mission is to entice you to buy programs. A far as jailbreaking, I don’t believe I will go down that road, it just sounds criminal (but I’d sure like to know if it isn’t)."
"89","Having other devices to connect to streaming content, we purchased the Fire Stick to use when we traveled. The size seemed ideal for slipping into a briefcase or backpack and it is.  Though our intent was to use it on occasion, it's become our go to device.  The ability to search for content across multiple services speeds the process of locating exactly what we're looking to find. Using the voice activated Alexa feature can be spotty which causes a bit of frustration (talk about your first world problems, right?!), but that is the main, if not, only flaw we've encountered.  It's easy to sign-up for trials of premium channels and easy to unsubscribe before getting charged.  The Fire Stick is easy to set-up and easy to use.  Would certainly recommend those looking for an inexpensive yet uncomplicated streaming experience."
"90","We decided to ""cut cable"" a month ago and the Fire TV Stick has made that very possible.  With just a little additional tweaking we are able to watch all of the shows and movies we want.  I have not missed a sporting event I follow either.  Best decision we made regarding technology in quite a while.  It is incredibly easy to set up and use.  Navigation is a breeze.  We are still trying to make the ""voice remote"" work consistently, but much like talk to text that is just translation issue.  A must own."
"91","I really enjoy the fire stick. Opens up new things to watch.This Review from a year ago.I know, call me dumb. But after using my first Fire Stickfor a year, and having no problems. I bought a second one for bedroom. Set up was easy and I am glad I bought it. I know there is talk about Fire TVand the Fire Stick. But the Stick works perfect for me."
"92","It's okay. After plugging it onto my smart TV, it screwed up my other apps that's preinstalled into my smart TV. I find it frustrating to use it sometimes bc there's just not enough buttons on the remote to make navigation easy. I get that too many buttons are not good but not enough buttons on the remote is just as bad!"
"93","We finally decided to go with Amazon Prime to not only to get expedited shipping but most if not all of our favorite streaming video on Hulu was available through Amazon Prime. When you start watching it you discover that Amazon Prime video will not stream through a Google Play stick nor on our smart TV. Consequently we had to purchase the Fire TV stick. It works great though, easy to set up and the voice prompt works well - although with my English accent, sometimes gets it wrong with somewhat hilarious results."
"94","When my Fire TV Stick stopped working, I needed a replacement. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Fire TV Stick with Alexa was the same price I paid for my original Fire TV Stick! The only drawback was that it was out-of-stock, and I'd have to wait for it. I received it sooner than expected, and it is simple and fun to use! Thank you, Amazon, for keeping a satisfied customer happy-again!!"
"95","I cut the cord about 8 years ago. And have always used Roku's and Chromecast. Decided to try the Amazon Fire Stick and have now determined that this is my favorite device. Setup is the same as the others. Plug into HDMI, then plug into power source. Amazon already had it programed with my information so once I turned it on, I was off and watching videos. The best part so far, instead of having to search Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and Amazon prime. I just ask Alexa to find the show I want to watch. Simple, fast and easy."
"96","I've used it only a few times. However, it works surprisingly well. I hold down the Alexa button and say something like, ""TV shows,"" and up they pop on the screen. I can use Alexa to fine-tune my search. And, then, when I'm watching and the phone rings with a must-take call, I push pause and it stays paused ... even if the TV times out. The Prime selections are pretty broad. The prices for new movies are fair and way less than what it takes to go out to a theater. I've been ill and needed to stay home, so the Fire TV Stick has been very useful. So far, I like it. Perhaps as I use it more, I may find things I don't like. However, I'm looking forward to taking it when we travel because we try to get accommodations with wifi, and then we'll have a great selection of entertainment and information if the weather is terrible and we stay inside."
"97","I bought one of these and loved it so much that I bought another for the tv in my bedroom. I have a Vizio Smart TV, but this is much more convenient to use with Alexa voice control than the vizio remote. It even understands my 4 year old’s voice when he asks it to play his show. The only other streaming device that compares to this is Apple TV, which is very expensive. You can also use the Fire TV app on your phone instead of the remote. Who wants to fumble through a bunch of remotes when your phone is always in your hand? If you use a lot of different Apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon to watch tv, this is a great place to conveniently use all of them without a lot of effort switching from app to app."
"98","I had issues at first with the fire stick at first and wasn't happy. It was buffering all the time and wasn't responsive with the remote unless I'd move position from my usual nesting spot and get close up to the TV.  So, doing some research I found that some people used a male to female hdmi cable to bring the media stick out from behind the tv where most ports are located.  Since I've done that everything is working like it should and couldn't be happier.  I like the fire stick better than the roku 2 I've been using.  It does come with a little pigtail adapter but wish it could have been longer.  I took 1 star off because of an extra 10 bucks to purchase a cable it should have came with in the first place.  I suppose it's all about competitive pricing, but I would have paid the extra for an out of the box ready gadget."
"99","Love my fire tv stick.me and my fiancée wanted to save money and reduce cable so I bought the fire stick. It was easy to set up and we had access to Netflix and several other channels. Be advised if your internet is not fast the other apps such as abc will not stream properly but if that is not your issue. You will enjoy it. I don't use Alexa voice too much but it's a cool feature to have."
"100","Someone bought this for us to try out.  They set it up, but we have no idea how to really use it.  The few shows we tried to find, were apparently not available.  So, we can't return it because we didn't buy it.  And honestly, right now we don't have time to play with it to figure it out.  In the long run it may work, but right now we are not using it.  So 3 stars is a neutral vote for me."
"101","This thing is awesome! I love it. I used it to watch the Championship game last night and it worked flawlessly! Compared to other casting devices, it had way less issues with glitching and having to re-load live sports (which is always a pain in the butt when you're invested in the game!).Recommendations are great and cross referencing actors is super cool. Also voice control is nice: if you know what you want, it'll get you there now!Totally recommend to anyone. We like it a lot more than our Chromecast, and we really like our Chromecast."
"102","I have a Smart TV in my living room and find I watch Amazon Prime more than network TV, so I wanted to be able to watch it in my bedroom, as well. My fire stick with voice remote turned my older TV into a smart one. I can listen to Prime Music, watch movies or original series and more in two rooms now. Love my Fire Stick."
"103","I was a bit sceptcial to buy this but good word of mouth convinced me. I connected the stick to the tv with the supplied dongle since my tv is wall mounted and I did not have enought room to plug it directly in to the HDMI port. It took all of 3 min to set up the stick as in came in all ready synced up to my Amazon account. The software is very easy to navigate and the Alexa voice remote makes it even easier. The Fire stick blows away the Roku i.m.o and I plan on getting a couple more for other tv's in the home."
"104","Had the original fire stick and went to visit my son and his 'smart' tv wasn't smart enough to do Sling.  Ordered this with Prime, got it before noon the second day and fell in love with the ease of voice commands.  Maybe the other old fire stick in the bedroom will die soon so I can get one in there for the sleepless nights."
"105","I finally dumped any cable or satellite bills I had.  Picked up (on Amazon, of course) an antenna for local channels and the fire stick for most of the rest.  While you have to put a little more thought into what you're doing, I am really glad I made the switch.  Will save me over 100.00 a month.  The fire stick is so easy to install even a bonehead like me had it done in less than 10 minutes.  I signed up for Sling TV, Netflix, and a couple of other available apps and I am good to go.  The picture is great, choices are good.  I like it so much I got another one for the bedroom TV.If you want to get away from all the overpriced cable and satellite companies, this is the way to go. You will loose things like a spelled out program guide, but to me this is the best thing I have done for my budget for a long time."
"106","I really like the voice activated Fire Stick.  We had the first one that came out and it was kind of a pain trying to find shows and the streaming wasn't good.  This is a huge improvement!  My only complaint is that we watched one of the Amazon original series,""Good Girls Revolt"" on the stick and we LOVED the show.  It was the story of the women that worked at Newsweek in the late 60's and their lawsuit for equal treatment and opportunities.  Couldn't wait for Season 2 and we looked it up and found out that it was cancelled.  From what I have read, an exec at Amazon decided he didn't like the show even though he admitted that he didn't watch it.  I also read that there were no women at the table when this decision was made.  I hope this doesn't happen very often or I might have to cancel my Prime Membership."
"107","Have had this since 9/01/17 and it works great except the speaker button has stopped working after one month of use. Will contact someone for assistance.P.S. Selected settings, devices and re-start and now the voice works again. I have now purchased two and have suggested this product to friends and family."
"108","I got this for a bedroom television.  I was worried a bit because I had heard it was slower than the Fire TV box.  The box is faster, but the Five TV stick is plenty fast, and quite a cheaper.  I'm happy.  Only thing I wasn't a fan of was having to go into all of my subscription accounts and download the channels, then sign in.  Would have been nice if it would have recognized our content and sign in info from the Fire TV box.  I guess that's a minor gripe.  I'm happy with the purchase, and may buy one as a gift."
"109","The remote is a great size and so easy to use. This is so much easier than Chromecast, which we also have.  It is also compatible with more products. We have both, but now typically use just the Amazon Firestick!  This is a great product! I wish I had not waited so long to purchase one!  Thanks Amazon for another great device!"
"110","I am in LOVE with thus firestick! I have never found a piece of technology that I have used so much.I can get EVERY SHOW ..EVERY MOVIE its AMAZING. I can not say enough good things about this item. It was inexpensive and it is easy to use and best if all I will never miss another episode of any show ever again. Also I may never have to waste my money spending 20 plus dollars for one movie ticket going to a stuffy theater because so far I have been able to get every single movie either the day of or the day after release in theaters. I couldn't be more pleased. I HIGHLY recommend this item and so far I have bought two..one for each suitable room in my house. Its so easy to use even your kids can use it and no worries mom and dad because parental controls are available! I give this item ten stars and two thumbs up!!"
"111","I'm impressed.. what a steal and what a piece of hardware.. awesome!!! The voice control with Alexa, controlling playback and my smart home devices..mind=blown.. amazing Amazon. U did it. Roku killer and I don't need cable. Just got Direct now..with another  free 🔥 stick for bedroom. Throwing my old Roku out.. super fast interface and response times to voice search and Alexa commands..No 4k, I'm ok with it...Voice doesn't work across all apps, only Amazon apps"
"112","I Love it. I now have two. So very easy to use. I just wish it came with more loaded channels. Like local channels. Maybe in the future. I have watched some great shows and movies on it so far. I have cut cable and satellite television services so i am happy so far. I really like that it includes Netflix.A"
"113","I'd give this a 4.5/5 if I could just deduct a half star.We're happy with the the new Fire TV stick. The stick can load every streaming service and media player we typically use including Netflix, Sling  Kodi.  The new Alexa Voice Remote works great and does a good job of understanding our voices and queuing up what we intend it to open.The only issue I have is quad core processor still isn't powerful enough to run some simple games like Crossy Road. Tried to load it for the nephews to play over the holidays and it was unplayable with constant stuttering and remote input lag.  We don't intend to use it as a gaming device but that was a slight disappointment.With that said, for a 1080p media device, the new Fire TV stick does the job well and I've already recommend it to others."
"114","The fire stick has been good... It freezes from time To time, and it keeps losing connection to the internet. I've been running a roku side by side and the roku stick doesn't freeze at all. The only issue with the roku Is its boring... Alexa is starting to feel like a family member. So yes I'll be sticking with the fire TV (although I might trade in the stick for the box) because there's simply more content on the Amazon units, however I do believe the roku performs better overall.  Roku streams better, and doesn't lose internet connections, but the Amazon product has wayyyyy more content."
"115","The fire stick works great always has a good connection to wifi and it's amazing how intuative the remote is I thought it would be a hastle because it has so few buttons but the menus are laid out so well everything is just one or 2 clicks away.  I haven't used Alexa on the remote much yet though so I can't give any feedback on that."
"116","Upgraded my old Roku player for this wonderful device!  I love this much better than the Roku, even though there were channels on the Roku I cannot use anymore because they are not on the Fire TV Stick.  I can live with that though. :)  All the TV Shows I keep up with are easily found on Amazon anyway, so there is not much of a complaint in that department.  It is simple to use, and quite honestly, it is also a ton of fun to go through everything on this TV Stick!"
"117","I am absolutely loving my new Firestick, easy setup and works great. So many options and things to watch that I decided to cancel my cable tv and now I am saving almost a hundred bucks a month. I am so happy with it that I just bought another one last week for my other television. I highly recommend it and hopefully you too can have the pleasure of telling your local cable company to go F themselves, I was so sick of getting ripped off for years and now you have a great option."
"118","I have no idea why there are any one star reviews.  I have multiple fireTV devices gen1 stick fireTV 4k and the 2nd gen stick.  I have absolutely no issues with any of them never have.  My internet is 60mb and I often run 2 of them at the same time with many other devices on my network.  Alexa is great and the new interface is great.  I do hate the banner ads, Amazon really should get rid of this or make it optional in the settings, or give the stick away for free, since the ads should pay for it.  This is why it is 4 star not 5 NO ADS on something I pay full price for!  Gen 2 stick is great for streaming and cord cutting with DirecTV now, Sling, and PSvue.  And the prime amazon content fills in some gaps for entertainment.  It would be nice to hide items on or rearrange the home screen but its a nice solution."
"119","Yesterday, I met someone, she's called Alexa & I'm certain I'm in love.  We haven't done much together yet, but just our initial introduction has left me smitten. She's bright, easy to look into her depths and easy to understand...All of this and we haven't spoken together yet, not a word has passed between us, I just looked through all she offers, but today...we'll talk!I realize, that like the rest of us she likely has flaws, who doesnt? However, I'm hoping those will be minor and I'm willing to overlook them.Should I need to make any major adjustments to these first impressions I'll return to this forum to repost, but I won't be surprised if you don't hear from me again about my new love.HA HA! SHE SPEAKS! My girl! Very clearly and quickly...LOVE is IN the air!  THANKS AMAZON!"
"120","Works great. I feel like we have a new upstairs TV now. I just honestly wish Apple and Amazon would get together to have apps for each other's content, but I also know that unicorns don't exist. I burned that bridge down long ago. So I'm withholding a star, because people (companies are people now I guess) need to get along."
"121","Set up was easy. I did have to Google how to change the format for my TV. No worries, I was done in less than 5 minutes including google time. I like that if I cannot find the remote, I can cast off the app to the TV. My son hijacked the fire stick as he loves asking the TV Alexa random questions. He thinks it's funny because I'll always answer on command being Alexa is my name as well. He says its the only Alexa he and Dad can boss around! Hahaha!!!"
"122","My favorite thing about the fire stick is that it is so much more reactive to the remote, if that makes any sense? Comparing it to my existing streaming devices, Chromecast and Roku. The responsiveness of when I click buttons on the remote is so much more sensitive on this product. Which makes for a better browsing experience. It also offers for streaming options then it's competition, and if you buy it at the right time, costs the same price. Needless to say, it also is a great product for using ""certain"" movie apps which may be frowned upon. ... but YOLO."
"123","I'm a big fan of Amazon and I buy most of my movies in a digital format now days so I thought this would be such a good idea. I like it, especially the Alexa feature, but I am also disappointed with it. I've had it for 2 months and I've already had issues with it not loading to the point where I had to unplug it from my tv for several hours in order for it to reset. I naturally assumed it was my internet, but every other device was working fine. I downloaded the remote app for my phone and if I leave the app, or my phone locks, whatever I am watching will stop. Most of the time everything is fine, but I am starting to wish I would have just got another Roku instead."
"124","I am immensely pleased with this. I bought it to replace the older streaming device that was part of my Blu-Ray player. The Fire Stick is far easier to use and to access. I'm an old lady, and it was very easy for me to install and understand. I was afraid it would interfere with my Echo, since Alexa is included on this, but since I don't have to say ""Alexa"" to make the remote work, it does not interfere at all. VERY happy with this purchase. Best $29 I've spent in some time -- I bought it on special."
"125","Ive had my firestick for a couple months now and love it! There are no kinks. After setting it up how you want, you can grab it and plug it in anywhere and it will work just like it does at home. When I was babysitting I could take it from home and put it in the TV at my sister's house and it would work without me having to reconfigure anything."
"126","I really didn't expect much with this and have actually heard some pretty bad things.I use this in my business location mostly for YouTube. However I was pleasantly surprised and how much is on this! More options than I have on my Apple TV at home.I think I will be ordering one for my house soon!"
"127","Firestick, best way to repurpose an older tv without a more expensive console. Could come with a universal remote, so buy one that controls your tv at the same time of purchase.  Streams very well in low signal areas of a home, did not dig into it to find out why. The video may start off alittle grainy but usually clears up in a second.  Draw back?  Sound quality! You can troubleshoot for hours or simply switch it to another hdmi port, problem is usually solved."
"128","I have purchased a few sticks and I'm very happy.  I love the Amazon videos and they have a nice variety of channels.  I currently subscribe to Starz and Anime Strike.  Very convenient for watching Netflix and Hulu.  I will most likely upgrade my Hulu subscription or subscribe to DirecTV Now and get rid of cable altogether."
"129","Noticeably laggy as compared to the Fire TV, but got it for the screen in my work out room and for that purpose you'd be hard pressed to find a cheaper or more elegant solution to cable cutting.  My new Vizio TV has a USB port, but it apparently doesn't pump out enough juice for this thing, but it isn't a bother, comes with a decent length power cord."
"130","Awesome device! I've cancelled my cable and use this with Prime Video as well as Netflix and Hulu. I dont have time to watch everything i'd like to watch anyway, so saving money by streaming vs. cable is a great option for me. I purchased this one for my mom and i've had one for months. She cancelled her cable as well. Well worth the money and works flawlessly so far."
"131","Holy cow!  What a change to our household's viewing pleasure.  We are ""free to stream"" now, and are loving it, especially with our Amazon Prime membership.  It was so simple to install and start using, and we have had no, none, nada, operating problems with it since.  I just love this little invisible device."
"132","I just set the fire stick up for my parents, they are enjoying watching movies.  Its easy for them to work and its a lot more affordable for them to have this instead of purchasing an expensive cable package.  I would recommend the fire stick to anyone looking for a economical way to watch their movies and tv shows"
"133","I love this, I showed my husband how it works and I was listening to music at the time while I was putting on making in the bathroom of our master bedroom, I hear Alexa's voice come saying the search she was performing I never heard my husband say anything but her was the one who did, and then I heard out again after the first song he requested was done and asked for another! Amazing we had such fun with two days of playing our favorite music together! We've been married for 21 1/2 yrs now and been together total of 26 1/2 yrs , this was definitely a bring us closer together item I never expected.YEAH. Enjoy!"
"134","After researching streaming devices I decided to go with the Fire Stick. I am so happy I waited for it to become available - it was definitely worth the wait.  It is VERY easy to set up and the voice remote works well.  Based on how many have sold and how many stars it has it appears others feel the same way!.  You cannot go wrong with this  device!!"
"135","Like the Firestick, BUT for some reason I keep getting programs I did not order. First was an order for the movie Logan (I had already seen) along with showing ""recent"" shows I did not watch (Animlal Kingdom, VEEP...), and opening a Amazon Prime account.. Amazon was quick to remove charges and sugested I set my account with a pin required. I did this and removed credit card account info so charges could not be made. Now, I find I signed up for HBO. Once again it was removed, and I found out the pin is not used with online subscriptions. They say my account has not been hacked, and might be me accidently clicking on orders. Could well be, but I feel I am careful and it should not be that easy to do. Anyway, just putting this info out to make people aware..."
"136","Far better than the bother of linking TV to computer.  Must have Wii Fi in your house to operate.  I found it so easy to set up didn't even need the instructions.  Perfect for viewing all Prime premium content and to listen to all music in the Amazon cloud.  I am unlikely to order pizza with it.  Only problem is once in a while Alexa misunderstands me probably due to my accent."
"137","I had the first generation and hated it. This one has a much better wireless radio and a better processor and it actually works without having to be right on the router, and it will run the Netflix app much more smoothly and consistently. I am glad the first one finally gave out. This upgrade (at a lower price than the original) has saved me loads of frustration."
"138","Pretty cool little device. I am not a huge user of the TV or new technology, but it was easy to set up and easy to use. The talk function on the remote is cool, but I have not figured out how to make it work during my other applications. So it is frustrating if I am on YouTube and try to talk/search and it automatically redirects me to Amazon."
"139","Have been a Prime members for several year and when we switched cable companies we lost all the free movies.  Looked into the Fire Stick and talked with others that use it and decided to get one and give it a try.  I will be buying another, since I keep moving it from room to room depending on what is happening in the house.  Spare room for workout videos, Living room for family night, Bedroom for sappy love stories that no one wants to watch with me.  Haven't tried the Netflix (etc.) app or purchased subscription to Starz (etc.), will go through all the ""free"" stuff first..."
"140","Pretty much makes your TV a smart TV.  Also it is great because you can download 3rd party programs.  The amazon fire tv remote app will not do anything more than the remote that comes with it does.  It cannot be used as a mouse either.  Get the app Cetusplay for a mouse feature.  The only way to navigate showbox."
"141","there's a learning curve , but i really enjoy the ease of just saying launch Netflix etc and i am on my way to watching whatever i want. all the Apps make it well worth the price. if your into streaming tv, movies, news etc and want it to be easy don't pass this lil gadget up! arrived quickly and was a breeze to set up ( but read the instruction book first)"
"142","I enjoy using the voice remote and a majority of the time it is accurate. The only thing that prevents me from giving 5 stars is because you have to buy another Fire Stick USB cable that allows you to use your T.V.'s USB outlet for powering the stick. You are given a cable but it only works with a 120VAC adapter. It would've been nice to have been provided with the right cable but I guess they gotta get a few extra dollars out of your pockets. :-/"
"143","My wife is enjoying Amazon Prime on the bedroom TV over our LAN - it is set up so that I construct the watch list from my computer and she accesses it with the fire stick in the bedroom - pretty cool. We may be picking up CBS access and Netflix Apps  at some point to be added to the fires tick App menu - Too much entertainment is not enough"
"144","I thought nothing could beat the Amazon Echo till I received the Amazon Stick ! It has given me so many movies to pick from so much to watch I love my Fire Stick it is the best! I have a limited budget and this gives me a way to enjoy watching TV and no cost to the cable company ! Thank you Amazon for the Fire Stick !"
"145","Before purchasing this device, I had to hook up my laptop to my TV with an HDMI cable in order to watch Netflix or to stream ABC shows.  It was cumbersome, the wires were a mess, and it didn't have my quality HD viewing that I desired!  This device has been my saving grace!!  It worked beyond my expectations and is perfect for non-Smart TVs!  The Firestick is quick to respond to my commands.  It holds the WiFi very well; I have not needed to reconnect it since I first set it up!  The remote is intuitive and easy to use and I love that it has strong clicks in the circular selection button.  You will love using Alexa to maximize the capabilities of the Firestick.  You will not be disappointed!"
"146","Got this on Black Friday at a good price as a backup or in case we needed a gift fast. Have not used this updated 2016 version yet. The old Fire Sticks just keep humming along. We really enjoy our Fire Sticks. We have given 3 or 4 away as gifts, already using 3 fire sticks and 2 Roku Players. Roku is just not as good, IMHO."
"147","This is great. I have grandchildren and was tired of paying high cable costs. I have a smart tv but when the grandkids come over, they want to watch what I don't want to watch so I put this on the tv in the other room (it's not a smart tv). They can now watch their shows on Netflix, Hulu, etc. without interrupting my tv time. I can even set parental controls. It doesn't need an app on your phone like some of the other streamers. Highly recommend this product!"
"148","Gave me the ability to switch to Hulu TV AND enhance my Amazon viewing too...I would highly recommend this. One thing to note...I am not a fast product adapter, and having just turned 60 yrs old, sometimes some of this tech revolution experience can be very overwhelming. The fire stick has been one of the easiest and useful tools I have found, in the area of TV and cutting the cord. Great product."
"149","This fire stick works fine. I already own the older version, which I tend to gravitate toward simply because the Alexa feature does not work. I also can not for the life of me download hulu on this stick. Still, good buy and functions well with everything else"
"150","I was expecting to have to fiddle with it a lot more than I did. Instead, I plugged it in, switched the TV's input mode, and everything went smoothly. The remote worked after I held the home button down for 10 seconds. The wi-fi password worked the first time. Hulu and Netflix and Spotify were easy to find and quick to install. Hulu was even able to sign in from my desktop computer seamlessly. Amazon's ""Alexa"" was able to understand me THE FIRST TIME when I asked it to find the show Gotham, and there was an option to play it from Hulu right there on the home page.Prospective buyers: If you're looking for a smart TV but don't want to pay the price of a smart TV, this is a fantastic alternative. Very intuitive layout.Note to Amazon: Give your engineers a pat on the back or a bonus! They designed a fantastic little device."
"151","I love this devise. It's quite easy for a 74 year old technology challenged person like me to use and what I can't figure out my 8 year old grand daughter can."
"152","We had the original firestick - last about 3 years before it started to overheat.  We probably should have unplugged it sometimes to make it last longer but we can still use it in the guest bedroom for peeps who visit. The new one is awesome with the Alexa option to search for a movie or show. Very happy with it!"
"153","This is fabulous.  It was very easy to set up, even for me and I'm no techie.  It works perfectly.  I am enjoying my tv more than I have in years.  All the netflix and Amazon series are terrific.  I can't believe this costs so little for what you get.  My highest recommendation.  Don't hesitate - this is perfect!"
"154","i find it difficult to find clear instructions (even on line) on what the fire stick can or should do.  also i cannot find a text search option which i would value at least as much as alexa as the searches in netflix, amazon and hulu always list the requested title in amid a list of several titles which may be relevant in case you remember a title incorrectly, plus often is a way to suggest other titles."
"155","I was looking for a streaming device that came with good recommendations and here it is. I love my other streaming devices as well, but this one is minimalist and streams consistently with no buffering, which is what I was after. Might have to retire some of the other devices in the house and get the Fire TV box next ..."
"156","I love the fire stick. I got one for my dad for father's day. We loved it so much we got one too. I think my sister is going to get one now. Everything is in one place. Before you had use the Play Station for Netflix and on demand for HBO Go etc. Now its all on one device and the voice remote is so cool. Just press, talk and it just pops right up."
"157","There is just so much football, History Channel, and testosterone-related ninja and steel cage wrestling an old girl can take on the big screen TV sitting in the family room and with sound level somewhere in the stratosphere.Along comes the Fire TV stick, and I hook it up to a TV in a remote bedroom.  Sunday afternoons, Monday nights (and any other nights for that matter) are saved. I can watch a movie in peace, listen to music, follow a favorite TV show, watch a cooking channel, and still have the old guy enjoy whatever he wants to watch (yes, with sound in the stratosphere). I'm not particularly savvy when it comes to anything electrical or electronic, but I followed the instructions and installed it myself.  And, I get control of the remote : )  It doesn't get much better than this."
"158","Screw you cable! I'm a Netflix and Amazon Prime subscriber, so this was perfect. Plugged in with no issues, and I no longer have to suffer through endless commercials. I chucked the cable box in the lake out back. :)"
"159","Plugged device into rental apartment TV, pressed the button on the Amazon remote, and we were up and running!  They had one of the HDMI's blocked but we simply removed the TV from the working HDMI and it was fully functional.  This is a lifesaver since cable content in the rented apartment was only the most basic.  This wa a great purchase!"
"160","Love this soooo much more than the Apple TV I already had.  The Fire Stick remote is much more solid feeling than Apple's, which requires a swipe.  Fire Stick's remote ""clicks"". No more swiping past the intended channel or function. No more touching it by accident and changing the channel (too sensitive). I've already ordered a second Fire Stick for another TV. Very happy."
"161","Great product. Works Fast and works well. Sharp video and Alexa Voice Remote is quick and easy to use. The voice remote brings up whatever you're searching for on the included apps that come with the Fire Stick. The voice remote doesn't seem to work as well with any extra addons you might put on the Fire Stick."
"162","I purchased several of these that were on sale before Christmas for gifts to our children. Fire Stick's are very reliable and easy to use. If you are looking to run KODI, it is very easy to side-load on a Fire Stick. Don't pay extra for a 'jail broken' model. They aren't 'jail broken', someone has simply side-loaded KodI on the Stick. There are many, easy to follow videos on YouTube that will take you step by step thru the process. Why doesn't Amazon block side loading? Because there isn't anything illegal about side loading Kodi. However, there is a problem with adding add-ons to Kodi to stream movies, but that's another story and we would never do that. I also have an Apple TV, which is similar but I never found a way to side-load it. Had a Roku, Firestick is far superior, I gave my Roku away."
"163","Perfect.It runs with just power from my LG TV's USB so now less wires behind the TV.It works fine with LG SimpLink, so I can use the same LG TV remote for most commands. Just can't do fast forward/fast rewind. The 10 seconds fwd/rwnd works.It's Android. Installing external apps is easy enough by using Apps2Fire on my Android phone. A little bit different steps to install Kodi but still, easy enough.There's also a remote control app for Android. The FireTV Stick also supports screen mirroring from my phone.Performance is beyond my expectations. I have more expensive Android TV boxes, but FireTV Stick beats them all when it comes to streaming.All in all, I think this is the best Android TV below $100... and it's less than $40."
"164","Love it!! I did have to call in a 15 year old to set up.  I couldn't, even after reading instructions numerous times.  He had it up and running in 5 minutes without even looking at directions.  I suggest if you have trouble setting up find a teenager.  They will know how.I have not tried the voice control.  Got this so I could watch prime and Netflix on my television."
"165","Bought Chromecast a year ago but returned it because it dropping my signal. The new Firestick has no such problem. Voice recognition is great and the family loves it. So why only 4 stars? I like to watch YouTube to learn, and while I can get to YouTube easily on the Firestick, I cannot search for YouTube videos by voice. I have to type to search which is a major pain. Don't know if this is due to a technical issue or it is Amazon trying to make competitor access harder but it is not good. If due to a technical reason, perhaps they can change by allowing me to use voice to record search strings and save them, and then use a saved search string after getting into YouTube or any other application. If not for this one missing feature (voice search of YouTube) --- I'd give this 6 stars (if I could)!"
"166","Got this for my parents for Christmas. It made me jealous because I have a ROKU. I will definitely be purchasing on of these for my own home. My parents love it. It's so easy to use. The home screen is a little bit overwhelming but the search function works perfectly to pull up exactly what you're looking for. Highly recommend. The voice control blows people's minds.."
"167","I was having trouble with my first generation Amazon Fire Box TV which was causing a green screen with the new HULU app so I ordered this with the help of a great Amazon support tech and since I installed it is working like magic.  It's fluidly is excellent and it is adaptable to other apps as well and I am totally happy with it.  There are 2 firesticks. This one is the new one and it is excellent."
"168","Love it! The fire stick is amazing. I have a TV in our grand kids room that is not hooked up to cable since they are only here to visit. When I plug in the fire stick to that TV it instantly streams cartoons, kids movies and educational programming to that TV at no additional cost. I love it so much I bought an additional fire stick and another TV to put in my home office so I can watch shows while I do my computer work."
"169","It's great. For anyone that's wondering about comparisons: It's basically an Apple TV with Android like accessibility. Does all the functions of an Apple TV (except it doesn't synchronize with all of your apple products) for cheaper. Layout is beautiful, easy to use and navigate. Remote is comfortable and simple. LOVE the Alexa voice feature. So easy to use! Love the product. Will be looking into more Amazon products in the future because of this."
"170","ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS! One of my better purchases. This thing truly does whatever you want.I have a smart tv in my living room and wanted one in my bedroom but didn't feel like buying a new flat screen. A friend of mine purchased the Fire Stick and sang it's praises. After researching it, it provided all the benefits of a smart tv upgrade without the cost. At $40, what was there to lose. Nothing. All benefits on my end. Love it and am purchasing two more for my children's rooms."
"171","In initiation, I have only had this device a few days thus far, the Fire TV stick has performed flawlessly.  It arrived on time and as a bonus was already set-up for use with my prime account.  The only tasks I was coerced to perform was to plug the device in to the a proper hdmi device and connect to wi-fi.The only areas I see possible for Mr. Bezos et al to improve upon such simplicity would be for he and his team to engineer the Fire stick to unwrap and install itself.At this time, current understanding of physics and availability of lastest known technologies as consideration, I can not allow myself to deduct a star for the aforementioned missed opportunity of improvement.In closing, job well done to the Amazon engine, top to bottom.  Well engineered, well executed from design to delivery."
"172","Love it! Why did I wait so long to buy this? Simple to set up and gives me access to Prime shows and videos on my big tv.The remote is hard to open but I googled how to do it and added the batteries. Love the Alexa voice commands. We now enjoy watching Grand Tour and look forward to season 2.You don't have to be a techie to set this up so don't let that defer you from buying it. Very happy with it."
"173","This works as advertised. It was easy to set up, easy to connect to the internet, and start watching. I was surprised at how fast I was able to get this up and running - literally a couple of minutes. I've seen products that say ""fast and easy set up"" that are NOT genuinely fast and easy set up BUT this actually was fast and easy set up. I like the remote even without the voice. I like the way the remote works manually but the voice command is a nice feature. I would definitely recommend this product."
"174","was nervous, would our wifi be strong enough?  It's great. We have completely dropped our satellite service. We are experimenting, Am Prime $11 mo., Sling $20.00 mo., Netflix $9.99 mo., Hulu $7.99 mo. and CBS on access ( which gives us some local news) $5.99 mo. seems to provide more viewing choices than we can watch. Big thing, no commitments and less than half the cost.  Everyone's tv tastes would be different. We are loving the firestick."
"175","I'm loving the upgraded Fire TV Sticks... The larger memory, upgraded quad-core processor, and doubled RAM (over the 1st gen units) really makes the difference!  We've been known to binge-watch shows using the FireTV stick (1st Gen), and after 18+ hours, it will sometimes reboot or lock-up, or cut out sound... especially when streaming video through KODI (from my media server), but these second-generation sticks do NOT have that problem.  I left it running through all seven seasons of Star Trek Voyager, and the last episode played as flawlessly as the first... no reboots, no sound issues, no problems!The remote is fantastic... the upgraded size and built-in Alexa voice-control make it very easy to find what you want, rewind, pause, etc. without fumbling through the remote's controls."
"176","Love this! Simple to use, lots of useful features, and at a great price!One design qualm. The remote was poorly executed in terms of user experience. Many people reach for the remote blindly (or in the dark). This remote feels and looks almost exactly the same in both directions. I often find myself using the remote backwards after reaching for it. It seems like a nit picky thing, but trust me, it easily becomes quite annoying --especially when most other remotes avoid this exact issue."
"177","I love the product and find it dose have a lot to offer. It works as advertised and I'm very happy with what I have viewed to date. The fire stick has worked perfect and I have had no issues at all and for me it's has been plug it into my TV, input the required info and watch as you please.Nice product."
"178","i think people should be aware that there arent volume buttons on the amazon remote. so you wither have to continue to use your tv brand remote or you can buy a seperate universal remote for the fire stick. for me it wasnt a really big deal but it did catch me off guard when i recieved my box and hooked it up"
"179","Love my new fire stick the voice control is easy to use, it links up with my netflix and hulu and thousands of prime shows to watch for free it so much better than cable and cheaper ,in my case at least I was paid 85.$ a month for cable with the fire stick tv is costing me bout 20$ a month huge savings for me"
"180","I love it!!!  I had all the movie channels with directv and canceled them because I can way h them on my fire stick. Also NBC is no longer being shown in directv so I was missing all the shows I used to watch on that channel. Now I dont miss them at all,  i watch them inn my fire stick. Awesome buy, I suggest every one get one!!"
"181","We got rid of our Dish service once the price rose to $115/month and we got tired of it not working during heavy snow (unless we climb up a ladder to the roof and clean it off) and rain.  We got the Fire Stick and use Playstation Vue for our streaming service as well as several apps.  It works great, although moving between channels/apps is a little slow.  We have two TV's and will probably get the $89.99 Fire TV for the other one next time, as it will probably be a bit faster.  Other than that I love that we get all the channels that we were watching before for less than half the price of Dish.  We use the Alexa Voice Remote on occasion and it works great, faster than scrolling through channels or apps.  I highly recommend using the Fire Stick if you are planning on ditching Cable or Dish."
"182","I was hesitant about buying this because I don't have a large internet plan or one that is unlimited. But, the ease of setting this up and using it has made me wonder why I waited so long to get one! I have never 'binged TV' before but can see how easy it would be do that!  I bought this mostly because it was on sale and I wanted to watch Downton Abby.  And, to my surprise, I have THOUSANDS of so many things I can watch with this stick. I have never had burping/delay in my connectivity. I love the remote control features. I've used the remote voice feature only a few times because I'd rather view the images/select the kinds of things I want to watch. But, it has come in handy when I didn't know the name of a movie and with Alexa, it found it right away!  This really is a cool thing to have!"
"183","The Fire stick is excellent it worth money Amazon was excellent costumer service help set up  it easy to use and get lot thing with fire stick my family love it to excellent price amazon is the best I would buy this fire stick I like  better any other one  I would tell my friend to fire stick Thank you amazon"
"184","We have the original Fire Stick too and wow this one is such an improvement! So much faster to respond to selections, loads better, like the size and shape of the remote better, buttons are easier to click too. This one was more expensive but wish I could have bought this option before instead of our other one."
"185","This is my 4th stick. I have one on each tv I own. I love that it has allowed us to ditch cable and not miss it. Easy to set up. This particular stick has worked better then one or two of my others. Sometimes the others' remotes don't respond well but I've downloaded the remote app and that never fails to work!"
"186","I was hoping for a little more. I chose Directv Now as my sreaming service and Firestick was the most reasonable choice. ( Directv Now wasn't available on Roku at the time ). It's fairly easy to set up. There just aren't as many good streaming apps on the firestick, the thing freezes up and has to be rebooted on occasion. Amazon pushes their Prime apps.  Now that my service is on Roku, I will probably switch."
"187","The AFS was perfect the first time I used it, so I got several more for gifts and another room.  It was easy to set it up and use the first time, then later everything fell apart - when I went to the Amazon support website, I read over all the ""fixes"" for the device, tried everything suggested, and nothing I did worked.  So I have a bunch of useless devices that won't work for me.  Very disappointing!"
"188","I've tried a lot of different devices like this and absolutely love the simplicity that amazon had incorporated. The fires stick is my favorite device to date no I have one on every tv in my home. We also do a lot of camping so it's very easy to take one off of a tv and take it with us as we head out the door for our next adventure. The apps that are available are more than adequate and amazon prime if excellent."
"189","Trying to get rid of cable. Be aware that a subscription is still required for several apps (ex. Fox sports, hallmark, lifetime, etc...) Which is why I've taken away a star; advertising on several is misleading. However with my Netflix and Amzn Prime services, there is plenty to watch. I am also able to get some local channels free via app. I still purchased an antenna ($18) to get the remaining network stations. I do like the versatility of being able to take the stick anywhere although I'm sure I'll order one for each tv in the house"
"190","I love this. I had the google chromecast but disliked that I could watch Amazon prime through it.Personally, I loved the packaging of the product. Very sleek and efficient. Not that it matters to the quality of the item, but it makes me feel like I bought something with a much higher price tag. The fact that it comes with a remote is great. Not just a remote, but a voice activated remote. Can't say that about my google chromecast.The stick didn't fit easily into my tv, but Amazon had that covered. It includes a little adapter to fix that. The software was already setup with my Amazon account when it was delivered which meant I only had to enter my wifi password. And, I didn't have to download any apps on my smartphone to finish installation unlike with my chromecast. Easy setup!"
"191","For my use-case this is not the ideal product.PROS:* It's fast and cheap, sure, and has a cool remote, yeah.* Additionally, incredibly easy setup.* Can actually play Amazon content natively, which Chromecast cannot do, which is ultimately what led me to check this out.CONS:* Inexplicably I cannot tell an Echo device to play something on the Fire Stick. This seems like a massively missed opportunity.* Cannot ""cast"" programs to it like you can with Chromecast and Roku. This is the deal-breaker for me.* Seems to draw more USB power than either Chromecast or Roku, and gave me constant warning about insufficient power until I just connected it to a 110 outlet instead.Looks like we'll use both Chromecast and Fire for now."
"192","The fire stick is awesome! Everything you could want is easily available and with alexa voice control it makes it easy to find.  I used the hdmi extender then velcroed the stick to the back of my tv to keep it out of the way. It only gets about 10* above room temp and haven't had any buffering issues yet.Alexa can answer anything, well almost! Ask her to find a show or movie and its done quick. Ask her to spell a word and it is said and spelled on screen, math problems no matter how big are solved quickly. Weather in your area is shown quickly and accurate. The Alexa on this isn't listening all the time, only when you press the microphone button does she wake up and listen, So you don't have to even say ""Alexa""If you have a Prime account you should have the Fire stick!"
"193","I am  really happy with my Fire Stick with Alexa Voice Remote. Coupled with Amazon Prime and all the streaming media available, I couldn't be happier. Amazon Prime movies and series can fill your day. And there are many other Apps, some free and some pay, that stream music and/or video to your TV. Thumbs Up!"
"194","The first Fire Stick to arrive was a dud...technical problems...I called Amazon and they arranged to have a new one sent, scheduled to arrive the next day. It arrived in less than 24 hours. I plugged it in and it works like a charm!!!I have had Apple TV for years. I love this Amazon toy! It's terrific!"
"195","The remote quit working after one week. I have replaced batteries and everything else recommended and the final solution was to use my phone app as the remote. While effective, IT IS AN UNSATISFACTORY SOLUTION. By viewing the internet traffic on this major problem with Fire TV it is unbelievable that Amazon allows this to continue without a permanent solution."
"196","I absolutely love our fire stick we could do so much with it and I'm so happy that I'm saving $150 a month on not having cable… We bought a Roku and a fire stick and my husband loves the Roku but the Fire Stick is my absolute favorite and it's actually growing on him. I take it with me  every time I travel as well!!!"
"197","The best thing since sliced bread! Is seriously so easy to hook it up to your hotspot or home internet connection and watch tons of movies or TV shows. I already subscribe to Hulu and Netflix, plus with my Amazon Prime subscription I have tons of options. This really cuts out the middleman, no more cable for me!"
"198","Love the Firestick! It works well, good connection to wifi throughout the house and fast enough processing power that it's very comparable to the Fire TV box (I own both).I'd buy this over the Fire TV because it's very comparable overall and the price is much more affordable. I would definitely buy this again!"
"199","Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote is a great product. Installed with virtually no difficulty and works exceptionally well. Actually, it exceeds my expectations and is very easy to navigate and understand as compared to other products that are difficult to install and maneuver. Definitely recommend the Fire TV Stick."
"200","Replaced with right version. Very happy"
"201","Package came, smaller than I expected, and I unboxed  it and was able to plug it up in a breeze. My amazon prime account was already linked to it when I received it. It had some preparing to do but after about 5 minutes or so I had access to all of the movies available from amazon prime. 10x easier than using my PC or tablet to stream to my tv. Alexa recognizes words extremely well.  I was also not aware that it wasn't just for movies/tvshows..... you can check your weather and also play some games on it and more.... Definenyly worth the price of it and prime compared to paying for the expensive channel packages through the cable provider.I only wish there was a local tv type app to stream certain channels I like to watch like weta U.K."
"202","Good price, fast delivery and it works with many useful free apps that are downloadable. Our son installed the stick and it only took about 30 minutes to get it up and running with a lot of those free apps. He also installed a free app on our smart phones to control the stick. We really like using the smart phone to control the operation of the Fire TV Stick."
"203","Alexa is great addition to the new fire stick and super easy remote. No training needed just plug into tv and voila! Also I love my channel subscription like HBO with the amazon account. no need for many password / login account. Best of all channel subcription are super quick/easy to cancelled with amazon."
"204","After my cable company (which I have been with for eight years) wanted to raise my bill over 30 percent, and had no interest in trying to keep my business, I canceled my subscription. Since then I have bought an HD antenna and a FireTV Stick for my tv's. With the antenna I can get the local network channels and with the FireTV stick I subscribed to Playstation Vue where I can get nearly all of the other channels that I and my family watch.  I am saving over 45 percent what cable wanted to charge me (which includes still paying for Internet service).  This is a great option for anyone fed up with paying too much for cable."
"205","I already knew this is the perfect player stick for streaming Amazon prime content and rest of streaming services such as Netflix.But my focus was rather on playing local Bluray contents using kodi.  Oh  My I was a believer of raspberry pi for kodi until I found out today that this one costs 2/3 of fully build pi 3 and plays 45 Gb Bluray rip file beautifully over its 802.11AC support! Raspberry pi3 does not have AC support. This is not ideal for a home theater use as it cannot bypass TrueHD & DTS-HD MA signal to an AVR but you can build invest in a chromebox to boot as Openelec or other equivalent OS for a better Kodi playback for Hi-Fi gearsIn summary, firestick is the best option if your primary use involves prime contents and for Kodi use, look no further! Ditch your raspberry pi"
"206","The FireTV stick with Alexa is great, it works just as well as my FireTV box, although the box is slightly faster due to the more powerful processor. But the best thing about the FireTV stick is it's portability. It is easy to move it from TV to TV and simple to connect. I always pack my FireTV stick for out of town trips and plug it into the TV in the hotel room as soon as I check-in. The FireTV is the only streaming device that will work with  hotel WiFi authentication that usually require you to open a webpage and enter your name and room number or a code after connecting to the WiFi. It is so nice not to have to mess with the stupid hotel TV interfaces and pay per view channels, just fire up the FireTV stick and all my Amazon content and other subscriptions are available to stream."
"207","I ordered this to use with my BenQ projector for home cinema. Previously I had to connect my laptop with an HDMI cable and adapter and the remote situation via iPhone was not ideal. The Fire Stick has made everything so much easier! It also connects perfectly via Bluetooth to a portable speaker, so I only have to use the one Fire Stick remote for everything. Very intuitive and easy to get started. Obviously, Amazon seems very confident that the Fire stick will meet with approval, because the fancy packaging - while not blister yay! - was difficult to open so that it would still look good in case I wanted to return the Fire Stick. But I will not return it!  I am totally thrilled and can only say: even if your set up works now, I heartily recommend this Fire Stick to make it much better!"
"208","The easiest streaming device on the market in terms of both setup and use.  It really is plug and play, unlike my roku that required me to set up an account with a credit card.  With Amazon prime video, Netflix, foxsports and espn you have virtually unlimited entertainment. Getting a great movie or the big game to my projector for my outdoor theater is a breeze.  The voice search (Alexa) works great.  Last night we were in the mood for something scary, asked Alexa to find 1408; BAAM there it was.  I purchased the Jackbox Party pack download through Amazon.  Jackbox is different interactive board games which are really great for family game night. The user interface is great and easy to navigate. This is the best streaming device in its class on the market; you will not be disappointed."
"209","This little device is so cool to have! I got it as a gift for Christmas and I Love it!  The only thing is this: If you dont have an Amazon account you have to create one while setting it up, and Amazon lets you sign up for their ""Prime"" service free for 30 days which is cool too because you get to watch More movies, tv shows, and series! You can even download games like ""PacMan"" on Fire tv without needing a game controller. Lastly, you'll have to have wifi in order to enjoy it, and it's very easy to set up. I actually told ""Alexa"" (the voice remote) ""Play Creed"" and the movie just came on! Lol... What a Great Gift!"
"210","Works great, I just bought another one for the other TV in my home. I do not have a smart tv and did not want to buy one just to stream videos from Amazon, Acorn & Netflix as the TV's I have work great.  The Best Buy salesperson suggested the Fire Stick and the cheapest solution.  I am very satisfied with the way it works."
"211","I really like that I can get the shows my grandson loves and we found some we didn't know was out there.  Like spiderman with tractors.I thought it would be good for my husband because he always complains that its nothing on TV, he doesn't use it of course, but still complaining.I would recommend it."
"212","OMG!!  This thing is terrific!  Not kidding.  So many choices.  I'm so glad I purchased the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote.  I am still playing with it to see all the stuff available and am having a ball doing it.  You MUST get one if you can and start your discovery of TV.  You will not be disappointed."
"213","I will start by saying that I don't watch a great deal of television, so I may not be the best person to review this. I use this on a smart TV for Directvnow and Amazon service after ditching cable.  It works great for me and what I need. It also gives access to Netflix, Hulu, etc.  The set up is simple and it is very user friendly."
"214","So far so good!!! I actually like the variety of free tv shows & movies available through Amazon prime! I also like the ease of signing up for free trials, if necessary. Some complain about Amazon advertising for their shows, short films, etc... Honestly, it's not a hassle at all. The only complaint I have is my TV's HDMI port and antenna outlet are right next to each other, so it causes interruption when my firestick is plugged in (my local channels don't come in like they should, however, on my other tv, it's not an issue since the hookup isn't close together). On 1-5 scale, I'll give it a 4!!"
"215","This is a superb product. It is my first time using a streaming device and had to learn the streaming way, but after I got the hang of it I very much liked it. I am still in that learning groove, but it has provided me with much entertainment and I am sure more to come. I would by this again in a heartbeat.... Pat"
"216","Awesome Device.  Not sure I care for the USB power cord, but it does enough magic to overlook that.Note:  You MUST use the Power Adapter AND the USB cord supplied.  Otherwise you are setting yourself up for failure.  I have tried using alternatives and most of the time I had issues with the device rebooting or becoming stuck in boot loop. I read negative reviews describing boot problems as well as reliability issues and I duplicated those problems by NOT using the supplied hardware."
"217","Amazon has done it again.  This Fire TV Stick is a great upgrade to the previous generation.  Having Alexa comes in handy for quicker rewinds or fast forwards without having to hold the button down.  I have used it everyday and have experienced no problems.  Simple games are also fun on this little device."
"218","1st let me say, the idea and concept is pure genius, very entertaining and I love the entertainment. In fact, we use this as our primary sense of TV viewing. For no reason at all today, the unit has just stopped working. I have reset to factory settings, changed batteries in the remote, tried different usb power sources and plugged directly into tv without HDMI adapter. All the things that people said might be the cause of a frozen screen or a restarting unit. I am able to navigate the menu about 20 seconds before it completely reboots, over and over, and over again.  Amazon Fire TV reps have contacted me and made every effort to correct this inconvenience. I am very satisfied with the resolution and appreciate the amazon team. Thanks so much..."
"219","Update: Amazon was contacted and replaced the remote with no hassle. Great customer service and great satisfaction after product was fully up and running!I love the fire stick, however, the remote doesn't seem to work? I bought this as a gift, been trying to use it for 2 weeks hoping the remote would come out of it. Tried new batteries and it still doesn't work.  Would be a five star if I could figure out how to replace the remote for it without having to buy a new one!"
"220","Just arrived today. I was pumped because reviews and advertising said there was a VLC app - but there isn't!  Painstakingly searched though the apps (btw, why doesn't the ""search"" actually search through apps instead of just amazon movies/ shows? ) and it is not available!This is the MAIN reason for the purchase so, rather annoyed. (If you ask my husband,he'd use stronger language).Otherwise the interface seems nice, easily synced up Netflix account. No lag time."
"221","I really like this product, it makes navigating Amazon a breeze. Connection is quick and painless and the shows with Prime are darn good. The only thing I now regret was buying so many movies on Vudu, as you cant watch them with the stick.Image quality is good and the voice search is very nice."
"222","So it does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well. I am pretty happy about that. The voice activation part basically is useless and doesn't work well at all. Now I have read reviews that say they loved it for that but maybe I got a defective one, I don't know. Sometimes it works but most of the time it doesn't. I can't even get it to ""sleep"" which is a simple command, so I have to scroll through a bunch of crap to get it to sleep. So, I like it, it saves wear and tear on my PS4 but the voice activation leaves a lot to be desired."
"223","I am so pleased with the Fire TV stick and the added value for my TV. I could access Prime content previously thru my Blue Tooth, but endured constant buffering and having to re position my router to get signal. With the Fire stick, the access is immediate and seamless. Has opened up a whole world of new viewing opportunity for me and added value for Prime Membership. I could only wish that it would be view-able to all TV's in household."
"224","If you have an older tv, don't buy this.  Amazon disabled the ability to adjust the overscan to allow the display to fit your tv screen.  If your older (2008 or older) tv doesn't have overscan calibration, (it doesn't) then the edges of the video will be cut off.  I will be returning mine."
"225","I purchased the Roku for one tv set and I tried the Fire Stick for another. Having compared both I would say the Fire Stick is much more user friendly. The opportunity to speak into the remote has saved so much time and clicking around for what I want. Glad I cut the cable and glad I chose the Fire Stick to do it with."
"226","Read descriptions and comments about all of the streaming devices out there.  With amazon originals entering the field of what to watch choosing the fire was a great choice.  Still navigating the waters of how to cut the cable cord but this gets us a lot closer.  Can't wait to hear amazon has its own internet."
"227","It has a better picture and it is faster and the voice option is convenient. It would be a perfect five star rating if it worked properly with my living  room TV, for an unknown reason there is no audio if I try to use it with that TV, the old Fire stick works fine with it and I can use the new Fire stick just fine with other TV's."
"228","I'm obsessed with my Fire Stick!  It's the only streaming stick I could find that allows me to play content from Amazon Prime Video.  It's super fast and greatly portable--I took it home to my parents' place and was able to access everything after I just connected to their wifi and plugged it into their TV.  The only thing is that you sometimes have to get pretty specific when using the Alexa search, like searching for a movie on, say, Hulu, because it defaults to search Amazon first.  It works very quickly and it's super reliable--it's a great substitute to having cable or plugging my computer into in my TV over HDMI."
"229","We made the switch from cable and couldn't be more satisfied with the decision. This device gives you the ability to use just about any streaming app you can think of we use it primarily for ps vue. It streams ps vue without any issues we do own the ps4 and it obviously has more features but the fire stick does almost everything the ps4 does. I would and have recommended this to many people who are on the fence for 40 dollars it's a inexpensive way to try out cutting the cord without too much of an investment."
"230","Love love love our new Firestick! We're able to sync our apps together in one place and stream movies and shows from one location. The Alexa voice remote is pretty neat, not necessary but a cool feature. Very easy to use and the package had everything in it to get us started... including remote batteries!"
"231","I love my fire stick. This is my first one and I'm planning on purchasing one for each room. With the fire stick and add ons downloaded from you tube I have no need for cable any more. I've gone from $160 monthly to $39 one time fee. Even if it only works 1 month it's paid for itself. I love it. Would recommend it to anyone paying for cable or those that don't want to pay, the fire stick is the way to go."
"232","With my 18 year old daughter's assistance, I had the firestick up and running in no time. (I couldve figured it out myself by reading the directions, but why when you have a teenager at home?)  it has been great to be able to watch Netflix again since the aforementioned teenager confiscated the Xbox to her room. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to stream and not have to fuss about bringing the game system back to the living room."
"233","I’ve had a Fire TV Stick for a little under a year now. While it was great for the first few months and I initially wrote a very positive review, in the past few months it’s become highly erratic. Certain apps are extremely buggy (HBO Now crashes once every single time before then working fine, Hulu works only sometimes and often logs out randomly, Netflix freezes up a lot when navigating menus, etc.). Our internet is incredibly fast with very few outtages so that’s not the issue. Restarting the device, clearing data/caches, reinstalling apps, and so on do not seem to do much – this device seems to work only whenever it feels like working. When it does work properly it’s pretty great, but it’s just glitchy enough to be extremely frustrating. Maybe the box version is more stable, but at this point I’m unwilling to spend any more money to find out."
"234","This little guy is a wonderful streaming device. It is easy to use, easy to install and easy to set up.  It is very versatile.  The only complaint I have is it sometimes gets ""lost"" and doesn't show up on my input list.  It seems to shut off, but there isn't really a power button to start it back."
"235","Amazing service, especially when combined with Amazon prime. Movie selection choice is far superior to cable and satellite tv services. There are enough movies available for free that I really want to see that will keep my evenings busy for years!Combined with other applications included with the firestick and mobile devices, the age of a la carte TV has arrived. Why pay a $150 cable bill for garbage you never watch. With certain apps, you can purchase content you wish to view and ignore stuff you don't like. Basically, you pay only for what you watch, and it's a lot cheaper than cable. Amazon prime has you covered for movies on your schedule. Firestick is the way to go. I have it and Hulu and another app my wife wants. My bill for TV entertainment is now $35 monthly."
"236","Iam a women, age 74 and followed directions and had no trouble installing the fire stick. Am enjoying the service and movies we get to watch. I do not like that we have to pay more money to get certain shows. Already pay for Prime and of course paid for the fire stick, other than that am enjoying this purchase."
"237","Not sure I'd recommend this. Its easy to navigate and much cheaper than apple TV and the like but so extremely slow that I usually just end up watching on my laptop instead. I even use the adapter that is supposed to pick up wifi signal better and it does not help. Switching from one app to another is nearly impossible. I've tried using sleep in attempt to restart the fire stick and that doesn't help either. I was really excited when this came in but I am mostly disappointed."
"238","The Amazon Fire TV Stick might be the best purchase I've made on 2017. It is an inexpensive option to plug into your TV and use apps such as Netflix, Crunchyroll, ESPN, TED, and the like. The user interface is friendly and easy to follow.I like the intuitive controls, and the fact that it's extremely portable. The controller is a nice matte black plastic.The only complaint I have is that I live outside of the US and there are many apps I cannot use, hence the 4 stars instead of 5"
"239","For 40 bucks, you can transform a non-smart TV into a smart TV.  1 star off because I can't load VUDU on it.  I know that is your competition Amazon, but seriously?  My whole collection is on VUDU.  At least give me the option to transfer my digital content to Amazon.  The voice remote is pretty cool too."
"240","It's awesome, but beware the FIRE TV ""STICK"" DOES NOT SUPPORT 4K.I'm gonna buy an actual Fire TV (the bigger one) because it supports 4K.That's what I get for not reading all the product specs. Otherwise, this thing is awesome. Works exactly as advertised with my 4K TV that I just bought."
"241","We made the switch from our Roku to this and in my opinion the fire stick is way better than the Roku. We had a lot of problems with the Roku remote. Half the time it wouldn't work and the response time was really slow. The remote for the fire stick is really fast and has the bonus of being able to do voice commands with Alexa. Also there are a lot more options with the fire stick over the Roku. We have Amazon Prime already so when looking for a new way to stream we thought we'd give the fire stick a shot. Overall we love it and highly recommend."
"242","We've had a Roku for years. We had the original model, and it finally died. The firestick has been a great change! It's easy to use, most of our apps are already connected to Amazon, so it'd more streamlined for us. I have five kids. My older kids love being connected to the vevo music video app. My pre-readers love being able to search for movies and music they know by using the Alexa button. I like that I can put parental controls on the device."
"243","Fire stick exceeded my expectations.  Easy to set up, easy to access my content on Amazon Prime and remembers where I left off with unfinished shows.  Also loads my ""wish/unwatched shows list"" to keep my library full.  Highly recommend although FireTV adds more capability by playing memory cards."
"244","We have enjoyed the lazy way to search for movies, weather, and even the time. Second only to the invention of the TV remote in home entertainment for the common family. Still find inability to get games/apps the Amazon site says we have, but then unable to find or manually receive through Fire TV Stick searched? But all in all fun to play with!!"
"245","Absolutely delighted.  Just plugged in and worked great right out of the box.  Intuitive controls and simple no problem instructions.  And Alexa understood my voice right away.  Simply do not understand some of the negative comments,  Even Alexa understood my voice right away.  Everything I expected and more - and a big plus: no longer need expensive cable channels."
"246","Amazon needs to join the android market.... there are certain apps offered via android that amazon does not have. This is annoying. I wanted to view specific things with my Firestick, only to discover that netflix and amazon prime movie options are basically he only thing available. I could have settled for connecting my laptop to my tv with an hdmi cord for all this trouble. I love amazon, but the firestick didnot meet my expectations. Amazon should offer more android apps!"
"247","How can I not love this!  Having Alexa at my fingertips is amazing and makes the fire stick so easy to use. Set up is easy and the selection is good."
"248","I received my fire tv stick today.  It was easy to install and the directions were very clear.  Once it was set up on my tv, I instantly went to my Amazon watch list, then I linked YouTube.  I love this tv stick.  Now I do not have to watch movies on my kindle fire 8 hd or on my lap top or on my desk top, I can watch them on my TELEVISION!!!!!!!!!  YEAAAAAA! This is a great thing to have especially if you love kung fu movies or classic movies like I do.  I have such a long watch list on amazon.com and on you tube.  Now I can watch all of them from my bed.  Alexa is great, the picture quality with the tv stick is also great.  For the price $39.99, this is a must have and I don't pay shipping because I am a prime member.  Highly recommend the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote!!!!"
"249","It works fine... once you can figure out how to install it.  I think the instructions in the box leave out some important steps for those who are not techies.  I had to go to Amazon's 'how to install the Fire TV Stick' to get better instructions.  Also, I don't care to use Alexa so I can't comment on how that works."
"250","Can't get enough of this thing and was happier than could be to stop paying fro my outrageous cable bill!!!  I was very hesitant to start streaming...but it has been a very easy transition and I will be ordering another stick very soon to have for our upstairs tv now that we know we can do without cable and can do this streaming business!!!!"
"251","Absolutely love the firestick! I bought a second one a couple of months later. Everyone that’s come over wants one now. Adding Kodi to it makes it a million times worth it! I have come to realize that the 1 gig of memory is a slight henderance and causing buffering. Im going to buy the fire tv next because of the added memory ability."
"252","The Fire Stick is great only one problem that I encountered was the batteries Amazon provided only lasted one day, the Stick notified me of ""Very Low Battery Level""  so I was prepared and bought some new AAA batteries.  I still rating it 5 star sine they did at least provide batteries to get started."
"253","I love this 95% of the time, but there are moments where the apps work slowly or the stick itself falls over itself. I think if I stick long term with Amazon Fire, I will upgrade to the 4k capable box. There is a decent app selection. The updates operating system is nice, but I wish we could set the power on position to be our favorite or most used apps."
"254","Great!  I had a Roku that was a pain in the ass to set up, and painstaking to use the remote.  This was so simple, and the remote, without Alexa is easy, but with Alexa is a breeze.  Alexa makes it so easy to say ""rewind 30 seconds"", which is hard to do when you are streaming on your tv normally."
"255","Great upgrade to the original Fire TV Stick. We've used the Fire TV for over two years now and love it. Most used apps for us are YouTube, Prime videos, Netflix, ESPN live, and Hill Climb racing game."
"256","My daughter LOVES this thing!! I am planning to get one for Our living room tv as well. The Alexa voice remote is awesome because you don’t have to try to push buttons through a bunch of screens to find something. You simply tell Alexa what to find or which app to open and it’s done. We love this thing."
"257","This is the second firestick in my home and I love these things. Kinda bummed the USB port on my Samsung TV isn't strong enough to power it and now I have to conceal the power cable behind the wall with my other cables, but it's not a deal breaker by any means, but this is more of a heads up for people looking to buy one."
"258","I cannot say enough things to recommend this powerful little helper!  I had a Roku before, and this is so much easier to use, and so much more powerful!  Easiest to set up, easiest to navigate, and easy to see prime photos, etc.  This is inexpensive, allowed me to cut the cable.  Highly recommend this!"
"259","I wanted to wait a good week to make sure I gave it a real work out.  I love Alexa.  I love saying Bubble Guppies and it pops right up or Hunger Games 2 and sure enough MockingJay part two is on the screen.  Ask for a weather update and hear it is....now I don't care for all the apps that are on there and will remove them.  I do not pay for more than Netflix and Amazon Prime.  I love loading the Amazon music and having it up on the screen.  The kids and I really enjoyed the lyrics being on screen. Super easy to use and navigate.The box is easy to pull all the products out and set up is less than five minutes as long as you know your passwords.  It prompts you right along and your watching programs in less than ten minutes.If your looking for an easy set up to watch your programs this is it.  The voice remote works great!"
"260","I have a love hate relationship with this thing and am debating returning it. I bought it mainly for my 4 year old to be able to watch some of his favorite shows, but apparently nick jr isn't available on the fireSTICK, only fire tv. Which is crap. Also having issues loading spectrum tv app, which was supposed to be supported but isn't. The plus side though is that the picture is amazing, it's pretty fast, I can search across apps for a show or movie, and the X-ray feature is pretty cool."
"261","I find this little device much better than buying a Roku Express stick or Apple TV and I own both.  Here is a list of reason why the Fire TV stick is my preferred choice.1. This comes with Alexa Voice Remote.  You can use this AI to search for movies or turn on and off your lights.  The potential is endless with home automation. The Roku platform does not have access to voice assistant, unless you side load it, and Apple uses the selective AI SIRI.  There are definitely more things compatible with Alexa than the Apple ecosystem.2. The Fire Stick lets you load a large number of apps and games, and runs them smoothly.  It allows you to have Kodi and many other entertainment platform.  Apple TV has less apps and games available, and you cannot load Kodi on it.  Roku does allow you to install a large number of apps, but I find it is a bit laggy when playing games.  The Fire Stick definitely is smoother than the Roku Express Stick.3. The Fire Stick comes with bluetooth.  I like how the remote is bluetooth so you don't have to point it at the device when you use it.  You can pair wireless headphone, bluetooth speaker, and even gaming controller to the Fire TV Stick.  The Apple TV 4th gen has bluetooth, but Roku Express Stick does not.Final Verdict.  Why 4 stars instead of 5?  I wish they would add volume control on the remote or on the user interface.  Something simple like that drives me nuts when i have to use a separate remote to adjust the volume.  Some wireless bluetooth speakers don't even have remote, so I know there are many frustrated people out there over this volume control thing.  You get more for your money, a lot more, when you go with the Fire TV Stick.  This is an awesome device."
"262","Absolutely one of the best products I've purchased this year. Easy to use.. Alexa can locate anything from weather to music. I've got Amazon Prime so there's SO much versatility in shows, movies and music. Also have Netflix and I'm totally satisfied with all the functions the Firestick provides. Best thing I did was cancelling my cable, and just keep my internet. Saving $110.00 a month and still happy with everything I'm watching. Purchased an HDTV antenna and can also watch my news channels. Who needs cable anymore? Not me.. Great purchase!!!"
"263","Love the firesticks.  Wish they had a little more memory than 8gb.  Give me a 16 or 32 and then we're talking.  Hate the remote.  How about making one that works like a mouse on the tv like the LG smart remote.  That would be worth at least 10-15 bucks more for each firestick.  But nevertheless I still love the firesticks.  I have 4 and getting ready to buy one for an outdoor projector.  Thanks Amazon"
"264","This is a WONDERFUL gizmo that will help your day to be joyful while relaxing at home. So useful. Limitless entertainment. Alexa is an added bonus."
"265","It was a fast ship and install was so easy it was a real surprise.1 Install stick in HDML port 2 connect to strip and boom it was up.Love it and yes i recommend to buy Amazon Fire Stick with voice remote.Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player"
"266","Sluggish compared to Firetv, especially using the Playstation Vue app but still usable. Mind boggling that this little unit does so much. I use a Denon reciever for our home theater, I read from another reviewer that the firestick had to be plugged it into the receiver for Dolby Processing, just FYI..."
"267","What isn't there to say about the awesomeness that is the amazon firestick with Alexa voice remote. Easy to navigate and watch shows/movies/music. I love everything there is about the firestick. So much in fact that I bought 3 more! One for each tv. Mainly because I'm too lazy to move one around, but at $40, you might as well. Cancelling cable tomorrow. Buy this, you won't regret it."
"268","Only had it up and running a few days but so far, it is working just fine.  My complaint is that, although to stream Netflix (which it does) and Amazon Prime Music (which it does), there is a good, working internet connection, there seems to be no way to browse the internet, i.e., there is no Chrome or Firefox application that I've been able to find. I've also not been able to find a ""search"" field. Finally, I've not been able to get Alexa to respond by pressing the microphone button.  Perhaps I'm just spoiled by the Echo/Dot devices which respond to a spoken ""Alexa"".It is streaming Amazon Prime Music as I type this and it sounds way, way better through my amplifier and surround speakers than just using my iPhone with a small bluetooth speaker."
"269","Works as advertised. Most of the really good things you need to pay a subscription for, but there are some nice free aps.Some you can get free if you are a cable customer like the TBS ap. Pluto TV is interesting. There is that other thing that can be side loaded. Lots of TV entertainment for $40."
"270","Love the Fire Stick and the Fire TV.  Cut the chord from Direct TV!Streaming is definitely the new way to go for video content.  Between Netflix, Prime Video and PlayStation Vue, I can get a ton of content for under $50 a month on 5 TV's.  Was paying close to $200 a month before the switch."
"271","Good specs on this device and works well but of course it's proprietary to Amazon so you get reminded of Amazon Prime shows/movies and I'm sure Amazon is doing a lot of data tracking when you use the device. I still prefer my Roku and Google Nexus to this device because of more channels and better features(I.e. being able to cast from my Nexus)."
"272","I am a loyal Amazon Prime member and buy nearly everything on here. I bought this fire stick in June, and have very displeased with it. DO NOT BUY THIS!! I had issues with it not loading videos, and had to restart the device every 5 minutes or so. It was not my WiFi connection as it would work every time I restarted it. I spent over an hour on the phone each time with amazon customer service, and chat. After having to repeat the troubleshooting tasks 3 times, they finally told me they weren’t unable to replace my device because it was out of warranty, after I was told I was always being transferred to someone who could “help me with my replacement”. I am very disappointed in their customer service, and the quality of this fire stick."
"273","Product isn't bad, except for ONE annoying problem.  SlingTV constantly freezes up (both audio and video), picture freezes up (I can still hear audio), or the whole app will close and go back Fire TV Stick home screen.  I've tried a couple work arounds, such as clearing out the cache, and it doesn't help.I previously had the old Roku Stick and NEVER had this problem (although everything was slow due to its age).And trust me (you'll just have to), my internet is not the problem at all.If the problem persists, I am going to have to get with Amazon about a return or something.  This is unacceptable, especially when some channels do not have a rewind function, etc.  And I will probably switch to the latest Roku Stick or try my chance with the latest Google Chromecast Ultra."
"274","The stick is reliable the majority of the time. It has all of the apps one could want, and it was working literally 5 minutes out of the box. The only con I have is the remote control signal. At times the remote signal either is not sent or received successfully, and I will have to move it around, while clicking, to get a successful response"
"275","I pre ordered the firestick and very glad with my purchase! It was shipped by the date stated on the pre order...a huge plus! It works GREAT & I would definitely recommend this item!!! It works wonderfully and we received our order on the date given.  Amazon did an amazing job at keeping us informed of when stock would be in."
"276","It works great, runs Hulu better than my Blu-Ray player and DirecTV Now better than my PC, but I have had a lot of trouble getting the Amazon Music to work on it.  No real instruction is available within the device, and as far as I can tell I do not need a separate Amazon app for it.  It is not much of a bother though because I have Pandora and Spotify I can use in its place.Also the ""App Store"" (for lack of a better term) is quite frustrating to use, because as far as I can tell I cannot type in a specific app name to find it.  I must go through the ""store"" and search through their categories.  Great solid product, but needs better tutorial/instruction for built in applications and a search function inside the App Store would be nice to have."
"277","pretty kewl except I had to buy a USB extension cord... and, I've been told the fire stick prior to this one came with such.that's a bit annoying.Overall, great product. . . . However, we'll see how long it lasts.It's now dependent on the extension cord I had to buy for it.(insulting)"
"278","It's okay.  I don't think i know how to use it to its full potential.  As long as u get kodi downloaded its pretty cool to have but all the other app on there u have to sign  up for or pay to use so kinda lame.  It's just cool cause u plug it in TV and watch on big screen.  Other than that it's not necessary  to have.  U can watch kodi  on ur computer."
"279","We have 3 now. Going to buy a 4th. We have smart tvs and I prefer the Fire Stick to any smart TV setup. It's great, easy enough my 5 year old can learn to navigate it, and if there are ever any issues turning it off and turning it back on again always seems to solve it. We've gifted one of these to my in laws and we plan to gift to my parents too!"
"280","I have one and I am still learning how to use, Since I have internet in my home I can get local station that I pay for. My son who I also bought  a fire stick for is a wiz at this kind of stuff. Just looking for a way that me and my husband can see everything that we like. It's there we just need to learn how."
"281","I like the fire stick but it uses too much data for watching netflix and CBS.  I just purchased it, and I've only used it two days due to the data it uses."
"282","This is pretty simple to plug and play. I've got the Google Chromecast and that is good for casting, but this has so many features built in that there is just no need to cast. I like the iphone app for it. So, pair that up with the Amazon Prime and it's a very cool deal."
"283","We had a first generation Firestick and gave it to our son when we bought this one. Absolutely love it! We have gotten rid of cable and use the Prime videos and music. Also love the apps you can download for tv shows and movies. No connection problems at all. Great alternative to cable or satellite !"
"284","Best smart TV device for so little money.Perfect match for projector or non-smart TV, because its small and powered by USB.For advanced user, once you install third party market by remote in APK to install, the sky is the limit, so many app is available to do stuff you want, such as sing karaoke."
"285","The Fire Stick has become my go to media device. Much better than the chromecast I had been using. chromecast just sits unplugged these days. I have gifted 4 sticks to family and will be purchasing two more for use on the road and for another TV in my home. Get it now!"
"286","My husband and I purchased this with high hopes! We are huge lovers of Amazon products so we just knew we would love the Firestick! Well the first couple of days we had zero issues, by the third day it kept resetting itself. I wasn't sure why it was doing that but it was. It's only done it a couple of times. One thing I do love is that you can cast shows/movies on the firestick just like chromecast. Also the Firestick remote app is so useful."
"287","It's all good, except you can not adjust the screen thru the Fire Stick's software anymore.You need to adjust your TV screen setting on the TV now to accommodate the Fire stick.This will change the look on your TV for your cable or satellite.Not good.I wish they bring back the Fire stick adjustment for the screen."
"288","I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  It's so incredible!  We can't get satellite or cable out in the sticks where we live but our local phone service did get an upgrade to fiber optics.  I only have 4megs but it's just enough to stream videos and movies from Amazon.I love how I can get all my music apps (even my Spotify playlists!) to play on my TV.  It has a changing screen so I don't need have to worry about any images burning into my TV.  I love this, especially on house cleaning days ;)I haven't figured out the Alexa feature yet.  Occasionally I'll say something and she'll do something with my TV.  I don't understand it but whatever.  I haven't played with it much but my 3 children have it all figured out pretty well.  Even the 6yo."
"289","Easy set-up, very user friendly. Picture is excellent with a wide selection of apps. I enjoy watching news stories from around the USA and thisDoes so very well. Alexa voice is a great improvement and using our Prime movies and music is a breeze. Connection time to play movies or music is very quick and stability of feed is excellent. Would definately buy again."
"290","Better than Apple TV as you can get all the features of prime and the voice search feature makes it super easy to navigate and pull up what you are looking for.  The only thing I don't like is that Alexa won't search apps that are not amazon apps for things you are looking for.  For instance I know current episodes of Hells Kitchen are on Hulu which I have downloaded but if I ask Alexa to pull it up she takes me to the prime website and tries to sell me past episodes even when I already have Hulu open."
"291","Simply amazing. Coming from a chromecast this is where its at. I love the Alexa function. Had it for 2 weeks now and still discovering new options and features. Was real surprised at picture quality. Especially seeing it is at the end of my wifi range on a very outdated wireless N router. Get my new AC router Sunday and cant wait to see what it can do with that. Side note: Thanks for allowing the ability to side load apps. Chrome is awesome on here for web browsing and will be nice knowing I can add my routers app so I dont have to go downstairs to reboot it. If your looking for a low cost media streaming device this should be your ONLY option. Outperforms some of the so called ""custom"" media boxes selling upwards of 100$. This can do anything they can and more."
"292","When scrolling to the end of a category either side to side or up and down, the stick freezes.  Won't do anything.  Try holding the Home button for 10 seconds, as recommended, and try holding the Alexa button down,  Nothing happens.  I have to remove then reinsert a battery to get it working again,.  I even changed out to a new set of batteries but the same thing happens.  Maybe I scroll too fast or something.  I just don't know."
"293","I have to say, I do love this thing, I watch it all the time. But, the ""search across all apps"" is a lie. When I use the voice search, it only gives me the option to watch through Amazon. Under the search across all apps section, it only ever has the Music app. Other than that, it's spot on."
"294","So far after getting this set up and watching a few movies etc, this is one of the best things that I have purchased and gotten regarding TV etc. Very happy with this product. I would recommend this to many people who are no longer wanting to pay cable or dish bills just to be able to watch some TV."
"295","I'm,ove this Fire Stick with Alexa. I and currently watching the Bosch series, which I totally are enjoying. During the day, I listen to music. Makes chores easier to do. I can see myself getting rid of my fiber optic uverse service, which is very expensive. The stick is very easy to set up and use."
"296","I am truly only writing that this is ok because other people have said so. I have not even been able to fully use mine because the first one (pre-ordered) was received and then the remote decided it just didn't want to work after I entered the password for my Wi-Fi. I tried relocating the device to allow the Fire Stick to sense the remote but no luck. Contacted support about it, was told I would receive a replacement, but when I called back Fire Support asked we could ""troubleshoot the software."" Besides the fact that I had to step away from work to make this call and eventually lose out on money because it took way too long, why should there ever be the need to trouble shoot a product received on the actual release date?Nonetheless, I received a replacement and was happy that it appeared to work. AND THEN THE REMOTE CRAPPED OUT. Besides the fact that the remote feels pretty cheap (and since when do batteries load with same polarities on the same side? Have new batteries started to defy the laws of chemistry?) , why should it be crapping out not once but twice? I will try to contact customer service when I have to time to do so to resolve this issue but this is absolutely unacceptable. I am sure people would pay more for better product. Beside all of this, how many televisions have front or side accessible HDMI ports to allow the Fire Stick to easily receive signals from the remote? I would venture to say not many, so why wouldn't your design or included accessories include something to allow for this. My regular HDMI ports are behind my TV. Which means if I did not have a peripheral device that I could plug the Fire Stick into communication with the remote would be pretty shotty. I find it hard to believe for all the years that Amazon has been in existence, the amount of money made, and the markets penetrated you call could not come up with a better design.AGAIN, I AM ONLY SAYING OK BASED ON THE OPINIONS OF PEOPLE I RESPECT WHO USE THIS. Also, I would assume that IF you can get the remote to work then it would be an ok device to use. But I cannot confirm more than I received not 1, but what appears to be 2 defective devices from Amazon. Time will tell......"
"297","I am so grateful for this as I was having to hook my laptop up to my tv. You are able to do so many more things with this than I expected. They have a lot of apps you can access, like pandora, HBOGo, and any other station that has an app, though you will still need to have an account with those apps to use them. Highly recommend."
"298","This thing is great! I love it. So user friendly. Already downsized my DIRECTV. Saving $45 a/month.  I'm considering dropping them all together cause I'm tired of the old way of getting television. Cable and satellite should be very worried because this is the wave of the future. Firestick makes it possible to get exactly what you want rather than buying a bunch crap packages of channels that you never watch. Finally!"
"299","I'm absolutely satisfied with this device, and I want to give it the full 5 stars because in most categories it really does earn them. Setup is so simple, and operation is a breeze.  Easy to integrate with my Prime account and just as easy to use with non Amazon apps and services. The amount of content available is stellar (as expected).  Portability is awesome, as all you need to do is connect to wi-fi and you can bring all this entertainment to a friend's house in seconds.The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the on-screen ""keyboard"" that you navigate with the directional remote buttons is not in qwerty format, but alphabetical.  A minor nitpick, but it does bother me.  Non-amazon apps and addons do have qwerty format keyboards though."
"300","Amazon fire stick with remote, was excited to get this, used it two times, the remote stopped working!  Put in new batteries, that wasn't the problem, not happy about spending $40.00 and now can't use the fire stick until I get another remote, this product should be reviewed and the remote improved."
"301","Awesome, seems faster to load then the last version (before Alexa voice). Haven't used Alexa voice too often but finds the app or show/movie I want to watch quickly. Pretty good selection of apps for watching shows/movies. I use Netflix, YouTube, Twitch, ABC kids and SlingTV mostly, but there are a lot of others."
"302","Love it, basically turns a non smart tv into a smart tv. This does not give you any subscriptions for free. You still have to pay a monthly subscription for services such as Netflix or prime videos. This is just to get the apps available on ur tv"
"303","I really enjoy using the Amazon Fire Stick. We have both the original and Alexa versions. The original hooked up to one of my Samsung TV's (with antennae also hooked up) worked just fine. The Alexa version, hooked up to another Samsung TV with antennae hookup, has issues. The antennae wouldn't work when the Alexa fire stick was hooked up. The only solution was to spend more money to buy a 3-ft male/female HDMI extension cord from Best Buy. Now everything is working fine.On another note, when I called Amazon when I first had the issue, the customer service rep was very rude. He had an attitude and basically said, ""too bad"". His solution was to only plug on the fire stick when we wanted to watch it. So, I'm supposed to crawl behind my t.v. each time? I don't think so. I asked if Amazon is working on a fix to this issue and he said no. One of my co-workers gave me the idea. Thank God for knowing people who know their stuff."
"304","Only giving it 3 stars since it was jailbroken as advertised but it didn't have Exodus added or a few other major add-ons like they said We had to go to a Utube video to finish the add-ons,sports package, cbd,nbc,, Exodus etc. At least it didn't take very long maybe 20 minutes or so to finish it. Never realized with the extra $20 we pay for Alexa that you really can only ask questions like you would ask Google for instance what's the weather like in your town, adding stuff to a shopping list, or just asking her General stuff like 2 + 2 and she will answer you. if you try to say a movie to find and play, it takes you to a buy/ rent page for that movie instead of the free ones. Overall we love it,just wish it was exactly as advertised with all add-ons included."
"305","Super company to work with. My husband did not know how returns worked and it was returned for a replacement very late. They refunded after the date was closed for returning! Awesome to work with. We highly recommend. Service that goes the extra mile! That's my kind of company. Thank you Fire Stick!"
"306","Bought the amazon fire stick and didn’t think it would replace my Apple TV, the smart part of my smart tv, and Xbox. I wish I had bought it sooner. Now I don’t need a subscription to hulu or Netflix. But keeping my Netflix cuz Tmobile is now paying for my subscription. Buy one n hack it. You won’t regret it."
"307","These units are ok, but scrolling through items is laggy and delayed.  I've accidentally clicked items because of this.  Also think it should have a hardwire option.  I have 3 of these units, and I think I will not replace them with the same unit.  I will upgrade to the bigger amazon streaming box."
"308","I love this product from Amazon. I guess it turned my TV into a 'Smart TV'. From there I subscribed to Sling TV which gives me channels I like (ESPN, History, Food TV, etc)  I just a pay for what I want, rather then paying for 500 channels I don't watch from Time Warner. So F you Time Warner I win!"
"309","I have the older version of firestick which I liked very much. Bought this newest firestick and the Bluetooth keyboard as an accessory. They both work great. The firestick is reliable and streams seamlessly where other devices may have buffering issues. I have no problem giving this item a high recommendation."
"310","Was really great for about a month .  After that it started freezing up like crazy .  I'm constantly having to restart and unplug and restart and unplug .  As I type right now my Amazon fire stick is all frozen so I will be switching over to Chromecast which does not freeze up anything like Amazon fire stick ."
"311","New owner, just getting to know it. I downloaded""KODI"" immediately as a review suggested. Although there's so much content needed for every function. What is there is awesome. Need to learn more about Kodi. I'm still confused about Fire. What is available? I've tried some things and much of it needs to be prepaid. Haven't explored too far though. I'm obsessed with ""KODI aka jailbreak"" but overall awesome piece of entertainment. I will continue review when I master it."
"312","Nice and small and does the job, mostly. I find the interface cluttered, and since the search is not configurable as to in which services it looks, I find it not usable. (For example, I don't want to find movies that I have to pay for when I have a couple of already paid-for services.) It's also less stable than my Roku; about once per month it locks up. And streaming my computer screen to it works so-so (frequent disconnects)."
"313","I was mainly interested in finding the FREE programs to watch with this device, and have found only a few interesting ones.  I admit that I was disappointed to find that it was necessary to have a satellite or cable connection to access some of the programming I wanted, and was not aware of this before I purchased it.  I am still looking at the programs, and finding new ones daily.  I have not yet paid for anything other than for the device itself, but will probably move on to that, (as I'm sure is to be expected by the seller).  I have also found it difficult to figure out how to mirror from a mobile device, and have not found a user's manual for accessing this and other available features.  Frankly, I was not interested in the voice remote and have not used it."
"314","I love it. My only criticism is that many of the programming apps still require you to have a cable service provider and although I have Sling, most of the apps do not work with it.  I have the Fire Stick so I can cut the cord and stop paying for cable and satellite.  But, beautiful resolution, no buffering. Just get rid of the need for cable or satellite and it would be perfect!"
"315","I have this item, PlayStation 4 and Roku. All of them are good. I am certainly not a tech genius and I found it simple to set up this product!!  This is my favorite out of the three streaming devices I have-I believe it is because of the simplicity and also the comprehensive services this item delivers."
"316","Just another tv stick. No wonders!Definitely expected more than just a TV stick from Amazon.Hardware : Slightly better than its competitors like Roku stick, Chromecast , no lagging if you got a good bandwidth.Software : Amazon tried to fit all the third party apps into their well known prime video user interface, for me it looked wiered.  That doesnt offered a fresh experience. Alexa is seems good but its fails to do a cross app search.I'm still wondering why these innovative companies like, amazon , google and Apple is unable to provide cross app searches to plist results from different apps ( when I say ""Jack Reacher"" to list all different prices from all - Hulu, vudu, amazon, google play, HBO, starz etc, so that i can choose the cheapest)."
"317","This is a great product for the price.My Roku controller cost almost $39 to replace. Listening through the controller is nice but will suck your batteries dead in one night!  It constantly had to pair with the Roku 4.Fire Stick gives you as much or more and is much cheaper."
"318","I bought it for the ease of streaming and all services it was compatible with, what I didn't know was that it actually had an android operating system and could play videogames.  My son plays all of his favorite games on it (minecraft, terraria, etc) using a standard bluetooth game controller I had laying around."
"319","believe it or not we haven't started using it yet.  We bought for our lake house and keep forgetting to take it with us.We have Amazon fire on all of our TV's and we love it.  so we expect to love this more - we purchased these for our bedrooms at the lake because the box will ""hang and dangle from a wall mount tv.  This for will plug into our tv and not dangle."
"320","First one was a dud but customer service 2 day'd a new one to me and it works fine.  So much cheaper than paying for cable.  Paid for CBS All Access for a year, plus Hulu and Netflix, got the other channels set up and I can watch pretty much anything I want any time I want.  I am satisfied so far."
"321","Really, really like the Firestick!  I have Rokus and AppleTVs, but my first impression after a few days at least is that the Firestick is a true competitor of Roku and Apple at a bargain price.  I got this one on a special sale for $29.99 and, now that I have experienced,the Firestick, i wish i had bought another as a gift at that price.The biggest advantage of the firestick thus far is the ability to play Amazon Music over my sound system.  This includes virtually everything I would want to hear and it is ""free"" since I have Amazon Prime. I also have access to channels for Pandora and iHeart Radio if I want a different experience.  I have become increasingly frustrated by my music choices on Apple TV..  Wish I had bought the Firestick instead."
"322","I'm extremely happy with this purchase. Being able to connect all of my streaming services on one device is a life saver. In a day and age where chord cutting is becoming more prominent, this is the right way to go.As far as performance, the fire stick is smooth to operate with no lag as far as I can see; the layout is simple and neat and there is even an app you can download to your phone and use as an remote in case you can't find the physical one.I recommend to anyone looking to cut chords!"
"323","Works but not as well as my blue ray player. Would not at first stream pure flux but eventually did after I left it alone for a while. I initially gave up on this but now that it seems to be working I wish it had more ram as it gets interrupted streaming Netflix way more than my blue ray player does"
"324","I have owned and upgraded the fire tv stick since they first came out. I have always gotten use to the slowness and constant restart to get the network to connect to my wireless. I finally bought the Apple 4K tv and wow what a difference!!! No more wireless issues and no more slowness. I use PlayStation vue and it would take so long to scroll and see the information load. With Apple 4K this info is instant! I suggest paying the extra, you will be glad you did! Also I was afraid to switch because of all my amazon prime and videos purchased, but I can watch them ALL on my Apple TV."
"325","Got this Fire Stick as a gift.  It has provided everything and more!  Easy to use.  But one word of caution:  I didn't indicate this was a gift, so it came registered to me.  My recipient had to ""unregister"" it and put it in their name.  Not difficult but something to be aware of. . . . ."
"326","...they LOVE it!Was finally able to bring them into the 21st century so that they can stop buying all the DVD's for shows that are available on streaming. Super easy to set up and I am really ecstatic about the voice search feature. That will make it so much easier for them to navigate right to the show they want to see instead of trying to remember which app it's on. My only critique at this point, and may simply be due to my inexperience, is the UI for Amazon Prime Video. Apparently it's not a free standing app and comes pre-installed on the device. Coming with experience of the Netflix UI, it wasn't clear to be the best way to navigate the APrime library but maybe that will come for my parents with time. Very pleased with this, highly recommend."
"327","I now own 3 of these and will be purchasing a 4th. Every tv in my house will have a fire stick. I was using my Xboxes and wiis to watch Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube and didn't like that I had to keep my gaming consoles on all the time. I don't have cable or satellite so this is perfect for steaming!"
"328","Though this will stream Amazon video flawlessly, I had hoped it would work for Hulu Live TV. Though it does work pretty good with prerecorded shows, or things you've saved to the Hulu cloud, live TV is constantly buffering, even with a high speed connection. Since I already had Amazon video on my TV, I really haven't gained much with the Fire Stick. I am completely baffled as to why a cutting-edge company like Amazon is letting others corner the market on live TV streaming. I'm confident that Amazon could do a better job than the existing players in the market, so the fact that they're passing up a great opportunity surprises me."
"329","I wasn't sure about this product as I have cable and use my PlayStation for Netflix. I really love it because I don't have to do all the updates that PlayStation requires and there are so many apps you can use to watch what you want anytime. My son loves you tube and it's nice to be able to put it on and keep an eye on him and what he's watching when I cook dinner. My other half loves it too, well worth the price! I can't wait to take it on vacation so we can watch movies at nite!"
"330","I bought this for my aunt who is very behind on technology. It needed to be simple but capable of accessing the content she was interested in. With a quick setup she can now find classic tv shows on Hulu and music she likes on Pandora, both using voice control so she barely has to worry about finding buttons on the remote. As an added plus, I can push photos to the Prime Photos Family Vault, so she gets a steady stream of new baby photos as a screensaver on her tv."
"331","It is very easy to hook up - but takes a lot of practice ! To figure out how to work out all the many apps.cause I'm not too good with tech stuff & no one will help me! But I LOVE it -- cept ""voice "" don't work real good . I'll have to try it more often but a great buy !!! Ps -- I need the TV antenna to go with the Amazon stick I would really love that you could surprise me and send me one I would really appreciate it because the TV does not work well and I do not have a TV antenna to go with the fire stick"
"332","What a great Upgrade from the previous gen stick!. The network/ no connectivity issue does not exist with this gen. The device is 30 feet from the router and shows strong connection. The response it quick and the voice recognition is phenomenal. It is able to recognise what my 3yr old says and play her cartoons from Netflix/ Amazon videos.Love the great range of commands viz. Play narcos from netflix, play rock music, play my station from pandora, etc. The introductory offer of sling, hbo, Hulu subscription, this is practically free!I don't thing this will replace my chromecast but it definitely replaced my Android box (used it for kodi, showbox, etc)I am a huge Android buff and I was able to sideload many 3rd party apps for free content"
"333","The Google Home and chromecast work much better than the Alexa fire stick so far. All of their (google's) products work together very well. Amazon just isn't there yet. I bet they will be soon. I wish that amazon would support something like chromecast. Being able to play across all devices at the same time is ideal."
"334","Bought this for my wife and she's in LOVE with it..One thing that could be better is to have some paperwork inside of the box, so you won't have to troll over the net to find the information that should be provided with it. This is an WONDERFUL purchase and I will be getting another one or two :-)"
"335","I love the fire stick.  I had cancelled my cableEntirely because it seemed wasteful since it's rare I watch tv. Basically I had t for my kids to watch shows, however over $100 for Mickey Mouse and Dora seemed bananas. We had Netflix and that seemed to be good enough. Except I wanted showtime and so I had a delema. The fire stickSolved all my problems. I can access Netflix and showtime and every other channel and package but for a lot less and I can choose what I want and I only have to pay for that. The best feature I didn't realize right away was that I also got the remote with sound. So no more searching for something. I can just push a button and say what show I want and there you have it. Highly recommend the fire stick with the sound remote."
"336","I'm very happy with the fire TV stick. It's easy to navigate and responds very quickly. The connection is very steady between the remote and the TV stick. At times it is difficult to navigate within the program, but that is not the fault of the TV stick but of the program. I would highly recommend the Amazon TV stick"
"337","Love this. Voice controls are a must. I'm not sure they even make them without voice controls anymore, but I highly recommend spending the extra few buck to get that. Much easier to search by talking than to click around an on-screen keyboard.In terms of quality, I know the Fire TVs are 4k capable, not sure about the sticks, but the quality is still awesome. No worse than any other product out there, and this one has Fox Sports GO. At last check, Roku, Chromecast, and others didn't have that. I have to be able to watch my local MLB games so this was a must for me. You won't be disappointed."
"338","I enjoyed alexa with the fire stick. It is  very intuitive. The only problem it has is that amazon changes everything it has into a buyer purhase even to look at a channel and that is very disturbing. Unlike Roku 2 generation.  you don't have the customer's best interest. They understand that Customers are cutting  the cord to save money!  Please understand and know that people want the internet but also want the choice of free or fee to fit there own budget."
"339","Coming from a first Gen Chromecast, I must say, this thing is fast. I can say ""Open Netflix"" and Alexa will open and get it started in a flash. Very impressed by the speed. The remote is great and can even be in the other room and change songs, pause, resume without being near the TV. The voice commands take some getting use to and Alexa doesnt work within the apps themselves (eg Alexa, show me cat videos in Youtube; She will either open youtube or show cat videos from Prime video. or ""Play Luke Cage in Netflix"") Also, I have an echo dot and it would be nice for both of the Alexas to communicate with one another like Googles new Home assistant. Like be able to play a song on the DOT and have it also play through the TV. There is room for updates but for now, this isnt a option."
"340","We are very happy with the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice.  It's a little bigger than our other Fire TV stick without voice, which makes it easier to keep track of.  For the most part, Alexa gets us to where we need to go, but you need to be fairly prescriptive ... for example, it does great with ""netflix"" or maybe even ""open netflix luke cage"", but it barfed on ""open luke cage""."
"341","The Fire stick from Amazon is pretty much the best invention when it comes to multimedia. When you install it you will have the option to keep your account on it or use a different one. This tiny little stick will then allow you to download apps and watch prime movies for free. Also give you the option to rent or purchase new releases not yet put in the prime eligible library. I take this stick on vacation and long weekends so my two year old can watch his cartoons. Very reliable too. I own the old stick and purchased it when it first came out and never had any problems with it. Just a disclaimer, this fire stick is pretty much not a good investment if you are not a prime member! Easy to connect and disconnect very portable and really reliable what else do you want in a product! Go buy it and enjoy it as much as I already have!"
"342","They finally added Netflix to the search results but they removed the ability to scale the display.My tv doesn't have the built in ability to adjust the screen size of connected devices.  For some reason the screen is cut off when using the Fire Stick (a few inches on each side).  In the settings of the fire stick you used to be able to shrink or expand the screen size but they removed this feature (while leaving the ability to check if the screen was being cropped...  Why?).  I don't know why they did this but now it's unusable on my tv so I am returning it.  Pro Tip for manufacturers... don't remove features from a device after it has been payed for and shipped out!!Otherwise I like the device but amazon really messed this part up."
"343","Great fun, but dont know why my SOCIAL BOT APP quit working, just learning what to say, how to ask, what it can be used/linked with as far as other devices, & other uses in general, beside music & movies is enough but excited to learn. NOTHING WITHOUT SOCIAL BOT APP THOUGH, NOTHING, UTILIZE THE SOCIAL BOT IF POSSIBLE, hope i can figure out how to get mine working again or fixed,..sumn. GREAT UNBELIEVABLEY GREAT OTHERWISE SO INTERESTING AND EXCITING FOR ANYONE!! ONE IN EVERY HOME, START A TRENDY THING, GETTER GOAL GOING, EVERYBODY IN!"
"344","I have an older Fire stick, but love the voice control. It may not get you exactly what you ask for, but gets you closer and speeds up searches."
"345","I'm docking a star but only for battery life in the remote....that's seriously it...this is that one remote in your house you have that inexplicity uses triple a when the rest of the remotes use double a...please come up with a way to make this remote use double a to increase battery lifespan some please!  Other than that....honestly would like a simpler to open remote...but wouldn't care as much if I didn't have to do it as often.  It's responsive...the device itself was fairly simple to install.  You can install regular apk package apps on this....so I'd love integration with the google play store...and maybe the ability to watch kindle on the firestick."
"346","This is almost bad to say but we have been trying to catch up our show. So streamed on Netflix for 7 hours with NO problems at all, no sound cutting out, no buffering, and no interruption at all. We were streaming on our Dish hopper and joey but couldn't make it 5 minutes without it dropping out or freezing. Just so others don't say that maybe it worked because that's all I was streaming but I bought the Amazon Fire TV and my daughter was watching it at the same time and my son and his friends were playing Xbox live ALL at the same time. I love this thing and I am buying to more Fire Sticks next week."
"347","After we got used to knowing how to use the products we have had nothing but great responses from the usage of it because we have unlimited Wi-Fi data Netflix and all that other stuff but it is an excellent excellent thing to have for your home if you have satellite with unlimited WiFi data we absolutely love it"
"348","It has a lot of great things about it.  However, I'm very unhappy how it pushes Amazon content.  Whenever I search for something using the voice remote,  it brings me to a menu to buy or rent items from Amazon.  Sometimes the voice is a little un responsive.  It would be better if I could tell it what app to pull something from. Sometimes the apps can be a little glitchy.  I wish they had an amazon fire tv box vs stick.  I think I get intereference via wifi when I put the stick on the back of the TV"
"349","Item describes itself, it's pretty pointless id you have a Xbox or a smart tv but for my older led I hooked it up and it works great. The Alexa feature is really awesome. If only the remote worked on all Amazon prime platforms so I don't have to buy one for each room. But it works great no lag or any issues as of yet."
"350","The stick is very fast to open apps like Netflix, HBO and Starz. Much faster than a smart blue player. I like that I can use the voice control to enter act with some of my Echo skills, I can use it to turn on/off lights etc, it pauses the TV show then continues it after inter acting with Echo.I like it so well that I purchased another one."
"351","First , it is ok when its not bugging out on me.  What I mean is that it can take a while to load when I select an app, or when it backs out to the home screen mid show.  a quick reboot usually resolves this, but I'm annoyed.  Second, what's the point really?  I mean i just wanted to cut the cord, but 2/3's of the app want my provider/subscription info.  i really don't want to watch single episode or clips of episodes.  third, i doesn't have the storage capacity I was hoping for, but it still gets you everything if your selective and not app crazy like me.  I do like that it intergrates really nicely with all of my other Amazon products.  Sometimes i feel like I'm living in a big Amazon comercial, that i'm slowly being inundated with.  Alexa send message."
"352","2017 technology is truly remarkable. Such a simple and cost friendly device, but so many different uses. And I'm half OCD and stay looking for ways to keep down clutter from wires and cords. This does the trick and has not let me down yet. Super simple to use and navigate. By the way I watch Amazon Video on mine, YouTube, and last but definitely not least PlayStation Vue. Streaming media through the internet with no interruptions. What's more to love?????!!!!!!!!"
"353","Great product.  Only drawback is the channel selection process.  Reminded me of DOS in the 1980s.  I realize there is something to keeping things simple, but the channel locating and installation is byzantine to say the least.  Thank goodness for youtube, otherwise the product would be  unusable."
"354","Actually worked great for a day up until I chose the ""Restore to Factory Default"" option.  After the restore,  the remote won't pair with the stick and there are no warnings or instructions for repairing it.  The stick is useless now but I'll  consider this a learning experience.  I've  ordered a new one and won't make the same mistake twice!EDIT:  Originally I had entered a two star rating due to the comment above... but the very next day I received an email from Misty at Amazon support with instructions on how to reset the remote and it works fine now.  Kudos to Misty for her assistance and Amazon on a great item."
"355","Overall:Great device that will stream all kinds of media. Replaced my subscription to television companies. Alexa is neat, but not useful if you are using the product for something other than Amazon supported applications. Very powerful if you have Amazon Prime.Pros:- Package arrived in a small, compact box. All pieces were secure. Packaging looked nice.- Set up is straight forward and easy.- Remote is EXTREMELY useful instead of using your phone for a remote (No connectivity issues thus far).- Low profile.Cons:- Lots of advertising.- Price is slightly high for what you get, but does drop occasionally.- Alexa is all but useless when using applications that are not supported by Amazon."
"356","Plug and Play. Easy. I have a Netflix and a Hulu account. I can access these on my TV with this. Simple. Thats all I need. I am not interested in messing with other things like ""jailbreaking"" it to watch an illegal movie stream from the internet. That is what everyone else is talking about."
"357","So i bought this end of June. Works great, saved me alot by disco my cable provider. But i went to use it today and the remote is not working. I figured the batteries shouldn't be dead already!!! Come to  find out the batteries are corroded! I tried looking for a replacement remote but cant find any, unless im looking at the wrong thing. But why on earth would the batteries have corroded? Couldnt find how to contact amazon for this issue so maybe someone else can point me in the right direction"
"358","It works great, and it's a great deal at $39.xx.  But I gave it 4 stars, I guess due to the learning curve.  Is there an OFF button...?  Do you just leave it on all of the time.  I also bought this for my son.  So while I was playing with it, I added a free program from Amazon.  Then I received a receipt from Amazon from my account of my free purchase. YIKES...!  I never set up my Amazon Account on this thing..  When I give it to my son, will he have access to my Amazon Account and can automatically buy movies on my account....????"
"359","Pros: EASY to setup. FAST processor. NO POINT remote. PORTABLECons: VERY Amazon influenced, as expected....somewhat.NO Sirius XM app.For the money the Amazon Fire stick is worth it. That being said though it is heavily influenced by Amazon. If you are planning on using a lot of the Amazon utilities it's perfect. If you are planning on running other apps it will work however it is a bit cumbersome. You have one small section on the main menu to access the apps and they are not very well organised. If you don't care about the Amazon utilities and don't mind spending a couple extra bucks I'd recommend a Roku (which I use with my other TV). Once you get the Fire TV stick setup and used to it it works very well. The apps load very quick and I have not had any stability issues."
"360","I wasn't sure what to expect. Hooked it up,  connected too my wi fi and Boom! I had the internet on my big screen!  I can now stream all the football games,  college and NFL without starting up my computer. YouTube,  Google maps... Too see a road map or any state,  city,  country on a 46"" screen tv is so detailed . Then there is movies and the ability too see old or missed episodes of shows ! The only two gripes I have is I wish I had bought a FireStick sooner and I had bought a larger TV.  Haven't used the ""Alexa"" voice button yet. The only question(s) I have would be how long is the fire stick software good for? Months?  Few years? You will definitely get your $$$ worth!"
"361","Easy to use. We went from having a Roku box to this and couldn't be happier. We no longer pay for subscriptions or cable and watch free movies and live TV. There's a lot of YouTube videos out there to help you set up different apps so you can watch your favorite shows for free. Wish we had gotten one sooner!!! Got my parents talked into buying one and cancelling their over $100/ month cable!"
"362","Fire stick with Alexa is great. Wish Amazon had where the older Westerns  movies come on Prime also the Theatre movies too. We used Kodi before the fire stick and you could get the theatre movies. I do like this better and the pictures are clearer and love asking Alexa things.  Maybe in the near future Prime will come with the old westerns and theatre movies too. TY Also the people I talked to last night were great. There is one named Mikie she was so great.  All of them were."
"363","I ended up buying 2 of these for each room in the house that gets enough attention. My husband loves it and it has many features, especially since we jail broke it. We use it every day and ended up cancelling our cable package because we weren't using it as much as we were using the fire stick, so we ended up saving a lot of money in the long run. I love this product and have recommended it to everyone who has asked about it, or are looking for other options instead of paying a ton of money for a cable package."
"364","Found the on-screen menus to be somewhat cumbersome to navigate through but we're getting used to it.  Otherwise it works fine.  We use it in our motorhome where the biggest problem is getting a strong enough wifi signal.  That's not the fault of the Fire Stick.  It's a fact of life in the campgrounds."
"365","I love it and it was easy to install. My 9 year old granddaughter already knows how to use it. I can now see my Amazon Prime movies on the Tv. The only problem is my internet speed. I live in the country and have a Verizon Hotspot. I can get to my Netflix account and don't have to CAST through my phone."
"366","Worked fine for three months and six days, then it froze.  Over 30 minutes later with customer support convinced the stick was broken.  Since the warranty expired after three months, customer support offered $20 credit toward new order.  At first I thought the credit would cover the cost of a new TV Fire Stick, but then I realized the new order cost $39.99. That is a pretty bad deal.Again called Customer Support and complained; eventually got an additional $19.99 credit.So, I'm even -- not counting the inconvenience of the item breaking just after three months and time in the customer support chat roomRegards the Amazon Video selection -- the purpose for the TV Fire Stick -- in my opinion I do not think it stacks up against Netfllix."
"367","For a couple years now I've been using a PS3 to access my Amazon Prime movies the other day I almost threw my game controller through the window because it was just aggravating me I broke down and bought this for 40 bucks 3999 actually best decision I ever made so easy to watch Amazon Prime now"
"368","I have the 4th generation Apple TV, but I was intrigued by the Amazon Fire TV Stick because of the content.  Several of the series are exclusive.  I purchased this product, installed it, and find that it's terrific.  Beside the exclusive content, the Fire Stick has added value.  I recommend this highly."
"369","Okay, I have been using the Fire Stick for months now, I just realized on my Sony TV that once I press the home button on the Fire Stick remote that it will automatically change the input to the Fire! Wow! What a time saver! I have been changing the input manually for months, this is awesome!"
"370","We are still in the learning process but so far we absolutely love it. All of the Apps we use (netflix, amazon, vudu etc)are so much easier to access and use! And we have downloaded many new ones to try. Love it!! Will post again in 30 days ir so but have faith our review will remain very positive!"
"371","This fall I met Alexa with the Dot.  I really like her but the lack of parental controls is a real pain. I can't block the children from expicit content.  However, I feel the TV stick is perfect for kids because you can put a pin that has to be entered to download new apps and you can block the TV content from ratings above the children's maturity level. My thirteen year old got into trouble with contacting boys on her tablet, so now she has this.  She didn't like it at first, but after a few hours she was able to find some apps she liked and really enjoys it. Now I just make sure she doesn't have email or Facebook apps on the stick and she is a lot safer. Then as she matures I can add apps and raise the ratings of what she can watch. Great job Amazon!"
"372","This product more than met my expectations.  However, sadly, it works better than the internet/technology needed to stream movies/shows.  I am happy with this product but not happy with the initial internet service provider to be able to stream effectively and I had to switch providers as the initial provider was only able to give me 10-12 Mb/s speed.  Fun talking to Alexa."
"373","I decided to give this device a try because we stream Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime through our XBOX 360 and are constantly kicked off the internet in the middle of movies and shows which is such a pain. I wasn't sure if it was the Xbox or the Internet but I wasn't having as much trouble with my laptops as the Xbox so I thought I would give this a try. I've only had it for a few days but I haven't been kicked off once. I honestly didn't think that I would care about the voice remote but my whole family loves it! Even my 5 year old can easily tell it what he wants to watch and it comes right on! For this price point, I'm very pleased with my purchase."
"374","It's not that fast to connect.Every premium channel has to be verified individually, could not get it on my phone, had to go to my desk top to get it verified for the TVEven free channels tried to charge, till I figured out what info they needed.Alexa is no that friendly, you have to be very specific.Prime - charge, even though I have secondary membershipMusic - charge, took me through 10 things to buy and sign up for, before it got me to my Amazon playlist. Still do not know how to go to my playlist directly and it does not have all songs I have bought through AmazonMaybe I have to get used to it, but it is not as simple to install as presented."
"375","Works great - simple to use.  Hardest part was opening the handset back to install the batteries!  As a prime member, great choices for free TV shows and movies.  My internet speed is 100 mbps so there is flawless transmission.  Unsure how slower - or faster - speeds might affect performance."
"376","Great device, but I keep getting internet disconnection errors and movies stop and buffer  However, this does not happen with other movies from other companies without sticks.  Amazon needs to roll this into Comcast direct stations because if the wife cannot match a movie on Saturday night, what's the point.  We have 2 and I don't use mine at all."
"377","What can I say about this fire stick if you trying to get away from cable this is a start we had only one my lil girl like dancing so we got here one we are in love with this product I hate we waited so long to get the second one we buying one more soon with more memory and you have to add prime with it you will spend a hour just trying to find a show to look at great great great buy"
"378","Really liked it over the AppleTV by far. I stuck it out for awhile on that device but decided since I do use Amazon Prime to try it out and I also use PlayStation Vue on it as well which works great on my slow connection. I did have the 4K version of Fire TV but I traded it in because I really could not utilize its full functionality because of my slow connection and saved $50. I can't tell any difference on my 4K TV, but again that's probably due to my slow connection. I'll probably get another one for my bedroom TV since the PlayStation 3 will not play Vue due to my slow connection, no problem with the Stick! Happy user."
"379","Received item and immediately connected it to my TV. I am 74 years young, but the set up instructions were easy to understand and accomplish. Within minutes I was listening to some great music and that evening my wife of 53 years and I settled down to watch a movie. Should have purchased this a long time ago."
"380","A very well thought out interface. Simple and uncomplicated, even my smart phone illiterate wife can find and add her favorite movies/shows to the watch list, which I had to do previously with our ""smart"" dvd player. I wish it had better integration with netflix but that's likely no fault of Amazon and not a complaint. Alexa is an extremely useful and fantastic product in the caliber 1 ANI (artificial narrow intelligence) space. I'm looking forward to future upgrades."
"381","Fire TV Stick is working really fine and I love it. I am using an iPhone so I have to use third party applications to mirror my phone. But we can cast from YouTube. That is wonderful. Fire TV interface is really user friendly. less than 30 min you can learn how to use it. I have Asian accent. Even though Alexa can understand what I am saying and she replies me in seconds. But sometimes my remote is getting freeze. I am still not sure why it's happening. What I am doing during that time is take out one remote battery and put it back. Also we have Fire TV remote app for our phones. sometimes I am using that too. phone app is easy because we can search by typing using phone keypad instead of using on screen keyboard."
"382","I am an Apple TV owner. Wanted to get something cheaper for the guest bedroom. Decided on the new firestick. I am in love!! It does everything that Apple TV does except airplay. And it's literally a third of the cost."
"383","would have given this 5 stars IF it worked liked it said.  have taken it out of town with me and under product description, it is adaptable and useable on other tvs (had no issues with 3 tvs ive tried so far).  but  on this one it will not even recognize 75% of time and the other 25% it keeps optimizing and wont allow me on the home screen.  Amazon support says...reset back to factory settings!  So lose all the hours I spent finding things i wanted to watch, searching apps and downloading, etc....thats your solution...no thanks.  I will take home and HOPEFULLY it will continue to work.  If not, it, along with the 3 i bought as gifts because I DID love it...will be returned and I will update  this review to 1 star, or zero if it will let me.  Pissed."
"384","Should've gotten the box. It works after Kodi is installed, but the movies/shows keep lagging and having to reset firestick and I want to throw the damn remote as it is so sensitive about working.... And when we try to fast forward it rewinds. It literally just started that like last week...."
"385","So far so good! so much cheaper than an Apple TV , We have a couple of these and a couple of Apple TV's, this most recent version isn't having the issues we had with the older Firestick, problems loading, or timing out, this one's been great, we stream everything we watch, this works great!!"
"386","Can't go wrong with this as long you know what to download and do. Can save you from spending hundreds on cable/satellite companies.  I also got it on Black Friday and was $10 cheaper from the original price($50). One time payment of $40x4=$120 saved me around $180-$200 a month! One thing I was upset about was the fact that I couldn't buy more then one on that day, which led me to use multiple accounts that had prime like my sister, friend etc... People that were going to use it. Highly recommend to everyone!"
"387","I really like the streaming TV,  but most of what I want to watch requires payment. I think if I am paying for Amazon Prime I should not have to pay more to watch. My favorite movie right now is The American President. At first I could watch it for free and did so several times. The next time I went to watch it I would have had to pay $3.99 or by the movie. I bought it in Walmart yesterday for $5.96 and it came with the movie Dave as well.I have Netflix as well and watch more programs on Netflix, than Amazon."
"388","I love my Fire Stick! It is especially great for traveling. It's great knowing no matter where I go, I am able to bring my entertainment with me.I can stream everything I want. From Amazon video to MLB TV, this has it all!I also love being able to use Alexa on the TV.So much entertainment for the price.It's small and compact so I can't even see it plugged into the TV. The last thing I need is more clutter in our entertainment center, so this is perfect!Definitely Recommend!"
"389","Works great. It turned my non-smart tv into a smart tv where I can now stream both my amazon prime media and netflix quickly with voice control. Set up was quick however I had to trouble shoot, the reason it wasn't immediately detected because it took a little time for the stick to charge once plugged in. It has other capabilities i.e. YouTube which I haven't explored yet."
"390","This thing is the bomb. I've been an Amazon prime member for a few years. We have a smart TV in the den and used it to watch the AP programing. The quality of AP Originals is amazing. We wanted to watch AP on an older TV in the bedroom, so I bought the Fire TV Stick. It works even better than the smart TV. There's no buffering and it's easier to navigate. We love the Fire TV Stick"
"391","While I enjoy the ability to stream Amazon prime content on my TV I have noticed significant instances where the audio stops while the video continues for several seconds. This occurs on multiple streaming services like HBO now and CBS all access in addition to Amazon Prime Video. I am inclined to believe this may be an issue with the processing capacity of the firestick as this never occurred with the same services on my Apple TV."
"392","I was disappointed in the tv series, the seasons were old. I was lso disappointed in the Netflix and Hulu portions requesting a credit card to use for more than a 30 day trial.  I could not  see all I wanted to see in 30 days and I am not interested enough to pay for them.  The directions for the fire stick were very lacking.  As a non techy, I would like a bit more instructions in order to get the most out of the service.  Also don't like that there is not a way to turn it off.  Pulling the plug every time seems a bit inconvenient either to the plug behind the entertainment center or the back of the tv.  A lot of the movies were either no names or so old I've seen them on regular tv.  in fairness, maybe I'll get better at using it with more time."
"393","I love it! So easy to set up and use.  I live some place where my cable is included in my rent therefore I have no control over the channels are content that I get to watch and I do not have access to on demand movies.  Having the Fire Stick has been awesome.  It gives me so many more options and ways to watch my favorite shows.  I highly recommend it."
"394","I heard about the Fire TV stick but had never used it or seen it in action. I was sent one by AT&T as a special offer for DirecTV Now and I was pleasantly surprised. Everything works together wonderfully. The actual Hardware was a no-brainer to install and the app was not much harder. I got things set up within a couple of minutes and I was watching TV right after that. It comes with a good selection of apps and you can download more if you need to. I wanted access to my broadcast networks in addition to DirecTV Now and was able to set that up with no problem. I'm a Believer now. I highly recommend the all new Fire TV stick to supplement or replace your cable or satellite TV. All you need is a high-speed internet connection, and sometime to enjoy TV."
"395","I ordered my first fire stick, to see how I liked it. It is better than I expected, so ordered another one for our bedroom. User friendly, just press a single button and tell Alexa a topic or title and several free options appear to select from.  I just finished a 5 part series on our Special Forces. Kids love it as well, cartoons and kid/family movies galore. Fire Stick is a great replacement for over priced cable or dish services. Quick and easy setup. There is a lot more available, if you purchase the app or if you have a cable tv provider, which doesn't make since.  If I could change one thing about the service, it would be to include local programming as part of the free access. I recommend the fire stick."
"396","We love our fire stick so far! We watch a lot of YouTube and Netflix, plus we have a CBS all access subscription and the fire stick does all that + more. Before we were using the original Wii from the stone ages for Netflix and YouTube support recently was retired. Glad we made the upgrade!"
"397","We had been using our Wii to stream Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime.  This works so much better.  It is reasonably easy to navigate and quickly changes between the three streaming services.  The only downfall is if I am streaming and my husband uses YouTube on his phone, it bumps what I am streaming and streams his phone."
"398","I love my Fire TV stick.  It's all I use now. Got rid of satellite TV, and I just watch Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon video on the Fire TV stick."
"399","Love it! Its user friendly and you can access apps via Alexa. The A.I that's installed on the stick. It's fast and easy to set up. Having the firestick has allowed me to cut my cable. I pay for live streaming and have now cut my Tv and inernet bill in half! Has all the apps my family loves."
"400","Very impressed with this little device. My smart tv in the kitchen never really ran very great and did not have a great selection of apps so why not give this a whirl while on sale. First time setup took longer than expected and complained that I plugged its USB directly into the tv rather than an outlet which still works fine plugged directly into the tv despite the warning. Apart from that its been running like a champ. The wireless works far better than the smart tv ever did, applications are very responsive, and the voice control works quite well if you stay inside a small range of choices or use it to start up non supported apps.For the price this does the job better than expected, with more options than my old smart tv ever did."
"401","So far, so good! The picture quality is great and we have noticed zero buffering, which was our main concern while streaming though the older technology built directly into our Samsung TV that is a few years old. Haven't had great luck with the voice-controls, maybe it just takes some getting used to. Being able to talk to my remote was not particularly high on my list of necessities, but I was intrigued by the concept. The only thing keeping this from a 5-star review for me is the length of the power cord. It is most likely long enough to go straight down from most TVs to the wall, depending on what side of the TV your HDMI ports are, but it is problematic for mounted TVs. Once you figure out a way to get it plugged in, the performance is great!"
"402","I received this fire stick for free from DirecTV Now for pre-paying for 30 days of service, and I love It!  I am finally able to 'cut the cord' with Comcast and stream DirecTV Now reliably and consistently.  Having a remote for me is much preferred to casting, as I am not required to have my phone with me at all times. At the current price point of $39, with included remote, the ability to download apps and games, watch Netflix and Amazon Video, I would recommend the Fire Stick over the Chromecast at $35(I currently own and use both).  My only complaint is that there is no dedicated YouTube app for the Amazon app store."
"403","I love it, I can now watch Amazon Prime movies on my TV. I could not do that before since I couldn't figure out how or if I could get the app on my smart TV. Problem solved. I am cancelling all the movie channels on my cable and will watch Prime and Netflix. I will save a lot of $$$. I like the voice search too, that is really neat. My first Alexa device."
"404","I held off on purchasing this for quite a while because I have Netflix. However, with Amazon prime, this makes a great interface for accessing prime video. I love seeing my Amazon photos on the TV, and accessing YouTube for workout videos. Will definitely purchase again for all TVs. The voice access is also a great  feature."
"405","I've been using a firestick for about 2 years now and just ordered a new one for my den and travel. If you use prime and have Netflix then you need this. Since moving a month ago I've cut out cable and strictly use this device. It's been amazing and I've put $75 back into my pocket a month."
"406","I received this today, one for upstairs and one for downstairs, and wow oh wow, it is wonderful!  My eyes were popping out of my head as I scrolled through the gazillion choices in every category.  When you click on one category it opens a whole other band of choices.  It seems to go on and on with wonderful things to choose from.  Some are ""pay"", others are ""free"".  I asked Alexa to show me FREE comedies on Prime and it gave me a mind-boggling list for both movies and TV series, and even one-time TV shows.  I am at this moment watching a movie, ""Miss You Already"", and put it on pause to write this.  The picture is outstanding in every way and not even a hint of buffering.  It's having a theater in your own home.  I might mention that this particular TV is not a smart TV, but you'd never know it now.  With the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, your TV turns into a smart TV and now I feel like I have my own TV butler.  ADORE this!  Because of this, I will be dropping my bundle of internet services that charge so much it might as well ask for my first born.  I'll keep internet, but drop TV services, and will be dropping the phone services as well and go with another system for that.  This is the absolute best.  Thank you Amazon!"
"407","Get one ASAP Goodby Cable Hello my Lute saved  about 200 bucks on cable bill thats right 200 Smackaroons Rediculious DirectTv and verizon bills over 200 Streaming playstation Vue and paying for some ulta fast internet service  200 MBPS still saving this kind of Money Do it cut em you will never look back"
"408","I would give it 5 stars if it didn't reset itself about 35 times a day.  If you think I'm exaggerating, I absolutely am not.  It's so ridiculous I thought about making a YouTube video about it, but it's not worth the time to me and I keep hoping a fix will get downloaded to customers soon.  One good thing is that it doesn't reset while you are watching a selection, but at any other time it can and will happen without notice (Alexa engineering: There is a clue there to fixing this problem, when does it happen and when does it not happen).  Hopefully it's just a firmware issue and you can push out a fix soon.  And by the way, the problem has become even worse since the last major firmware upgrade (when you changed the look and feel of the UI), that should give you yet another clue (the latest release affected the issue's behavior, made it worse).  Please elevate this issue and address it in your next sprint - I'll come back and give you 5 stars when it's fixed.  :)  p.s.  I have sympathy, I do this kind of thing for a living and bugs do happen, but I'm amazed that it got past Amazon QA - it's such an annoying and frequently occurring bug that you'd think they would have cared more (unless management forced it out prematurely to hit their target window, which if true then I think I should start shopping for a replacement from a competitor)."
"409","I love it.  The picture quality is actually better when using the stick.  Using Alex's is still challenging, or just plain funny, according to my kids for me but I admit I'm technologically challenged.  So many networks I never knew existed!!  Update:  Well, it's been a couple weeks with Alexa.  I can't say I understand what it's supposed to do besides be a remote.  I tried asking for a show called Jack Taylor and got Hannah Montana. Lmao!!!  This would make sense if there was a character on the show with that name but, no, soooo....  Tried Googling info but that didnt help.  Just a lot of self appointed experts, aka middle aged men with monotone voices, who explained how to check the weather.  Still glad I got it just dumbfounded with this one feature."
"410","I enjoy my fire stick. Tbh, I don't really use the voice command. I do have one complaint. The remote drains batteries like nothing I have ever seen before. No matter what brand I get this thing eats batteries like it's starving. I'm changing batteries every week. That is costing me a lot of money on batteries."
"411","Very Easy setup, no problems with the setup.  Takes less than 10 minutes to set it up.  Comes with everything for the firestick to work, no addons needed.  I installed this on my regular (non-smart) TV.  Still stick basically makes your TV smart.  You can watch Netflix, hulu, amazon TV, etc."
"412","Yes I love it, I use it more then I use my DVR.  In fact I haven't watched a recorded program since purchasing the Fire TV Stick.  The hook up, and setup is easy, and you are up in business in no time.  It come pre-loaded with many Apps, but adding your favorite apps is easy.  I would recommend the Fire TV Stick."
"413","We were trying to get rid of paid TV, with all those crazy channels that you don't even watch. Plus I wanted to be able to watch my NFL team with out having to buy in to Direct TV's ridiculous pricing. So excited when I could do that. The KODI app is super and easy to use.Love having this device and the ability to sync my Bluetooth head phones is icing on the cake."
"414","What is Cable, who are they?  I still use them but way less since there are too many channels to watch and I only have two eyes and limited time to watch per day since I have to work.  I know Internet and what they do for me... This little power stick has allowed me to become free and as long as I have the internet I will forever be free and see the bill slowly decline every month as soon as I master this power stick."
"415","I love being able to watch my movies on my bigger tv. Before, I watched them on my Kindle Fire, which was good, but this is great! We don't have access to cable and I don't watch television, only a movie if it looks interesting. This is perfect for my lifestyle. I'm even getting them for my grown kids. GREAT presents!"
"416","Product works perfectly! Everything was well packaged and easy to set up! You will need an amazon account to use this item, but after that installation is a breeze! Make sure your tv is compatible with the HDMI port as well as have a stable internet connection. I would buy this product again and very fast shipping!"
"417","I live in the country where there is no cable and very unreliable dish service. I use a portable WiFi device from my cell phone provider and used to use my computer to watch my shows, which was a pain. The Amazon Fire stick frees up the computer and gives me a great assortment of shows to watch. The Fire stick is a great tool and saves me a lot of money because I don't have to get a dish service."
"418","The Amazon firestick did everything I expected it to...  once I got it to work. The primary problem was getting a strong enough wifi signal. Two reasons for this. First, the HDMI cable and the extender were so short that the actual stick was fully blocked by being hidden behind my TV, and I had to purchase an additional 6 foot HDMI extension cable to position the firestick where it could see the wifi signal. The signal from my upstairs router was still somewhat weak, so I then had to purchase a wifi booster. After an additional cost of another $50 and another week delivery time, everything now functions perfectly.  YMMV (your mileage may vary) !  😎"
"419","The All-New Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote is, by far, the best TV/Movie gadget I have ever used or purchased. I purchased the Fire TV Stick because, 1) I was having trouble with my Chromecast and 2) I could not access Prime movies, etc, so it seemed limiting. While the Chromecast worked ok and it was better than nothing (I do not have cable nor Direct TV or anything like that), I was extremely frustrated with the Chromecast, which cost me approximately the same amount of money. Now, I am happy that I took the plunge and ordered the Fire TV Stick!!The Fire Stick arrived neatly packaged and it was easy to open, figure out and set-up. All of five minutes!!  The system, Stick and remote were all easy to use and navigate. Like Apple products, I am finding the Fire Stick to be extremely intuitive,  which is a huge plus for me!  I love having access to the the Prime perks without having to use my computer or tablet.  Perhaps there is a way that I could have done used he Prime w/ what I had, but I could not figure it out and  I am not a fan of being frustrated and/or impatient.  I also did not like all of the steps that I had to do to make the Chromecast when it would not work.  The voice remote is amazing and very easy to use. I love it so much! I'm so glad that I switched. Yay!!! @LadyToy007"
"420","The Amazon FireStick was definitely a good purchase! It's a product that is similar to Roku. I own both products, but I give the FireStick my vote! No only does the FireStick have a easier display when it comes to navigating throughout the apps, but I noticed that it is also quicker when when it came down to the speed of going through the apps. Roku has a bit of an delay with its timing but the FireStick was right on. I also noticed that the FireStick has a more variety of apps in its App Store. They have your basic television and movies but it also has games that you are able to play with the remote that it is given. They have more complicated games but for that, you have to purchase a seperatw controller.  Overall a great product! I love it!"
"421","For the most part I like it.  However, I primarily wanted this for Playstation Vue which runs slowly on this device.  Its usable but sometimes frustrating.  I also have the newer ROKU stick on a different TV and Vue runs much faster on it.  Unfortunately, the Vue app on this ROKU is not as thorough as on the fire stick.  The performance is fine for everything else, however.  I also use it for Netflix and my Plex server and it runs those apps perfectly fine.The only other complaint is not being able to use USB power.  A nice point to the stick devices is the lack of cables to/from the TV.  The fire stick is USB but on 2 of the three TVs I've tried it on the USB power is not sufficient to run the device.Overall, I would recommend the device (and have)."
"422","Bought it to replace my original TV stick, but not sure if I want to keep, or return it. Most important issue: the calibration tool does not work, that cuts off menu in Apps, obviously, if your TV overscans. Very unpleasant. The previous stick could do it beautifully, I wonder what happened with this one which is supposed to be more powerful. Amazon is saying that they are working on a fix but can't provide the timeline.Speed-wise there is not much difference between this new stick and the old one. Alexa has disappointed me a bit, not sure if it is very helpful, can't do simple searches outside video/audio world. Asks me to install Alexa App (what, seriously, Alexa?!), ha-ha. I hope they will fix that too.Will reconsider the rating once they fix the calibration issue."
"423","I was spending a hundred forty bucks a month on cable I get virtually every channel I want with this it does take some downloading of different apps most recently I downloaded popular local news. It does take more effort to manage at than a cable box but it's also free after the initial cost."
"424","We purchased our Fire stick because we wanted more tv viewing options and we wanted to see if we could use this to replace our cable tv.  While we haven't cut the cable yet, I can say that we are loving all the fresh content ( new to us ) on Amazon Prime and we are also using Netflix much more. Installation was easy and the device streams beautifully. I am very happy with this purchase."
"425","The Fire TV Stick not only met my expectations but it exceeded my expectations.I would recommend this to my friends and family. I have paid cable bills from $170-$200 monthly for over twenty years. I can honestly say, because of the fire stick my cable bill for basic cable and Internet Wi-F is under $65 monthly. I am truly enjoying it thus far."
"426","Holy buckets!  If I were single (and not married to someone addicted to cable television) this would be the only TV subscription service I'd have.  I pay a small fee each year and get everything I want in return.  It is so user friendly that every family member can use it.  Plus, we can use it for a wide variety of things - You Tube, television, movies, and apps.  Again, if you are a casual television consumer and aren't terribly picky about what you watch and when you watch it (eg, don't have to have the latest episodes and don't have to have specific shows) then this is the perfect alternative for you.  I end up watching mostly You Tube videos, because most of the shows I want to watch (reality series) are posted on You Tube (free) shortly."
"427","Installed onto a 2016 Samsung 4K HD TV; installation was easy, TV recognized the Fire Stick immediately.  There are many, many apps available, and adding them to the programming was simple. This Fire Stick replaced a first generation Apple TV; not really fair to compare the two due to the age of the Apple TV, but as you would expect, there is far more streaming content available on the Fire Stick.  Alexa is great, just press a button and ask for a specific app. While using the remote is not difficult, asking Alexa to open apps is a breeze. Price is right, quality is great, installation is simple.  What's not to like?"
"428","Terrific! Simple install--I had to use the extender, which is supposed to improve the reception, but this was also simple. Once it was all plugged in, I changed the input and the instructions appeared on screen. I followed those, and it all worked. The remote works as simply as Alexa works. All of it was easy and quick."
"429","Couldn't get this item to work.  Not sure if broke or if you sent me dead batteries.  This item is at my lake house, so I will take some batteries with me in October to see if I can get it to work.  I left it plugged in to charge while I am gone but I think the problem is with the remote."
"430","Some of the channels refused either my email  address or password (at least tell me which one ) as incorrect although I entered both numerous times. It should be easier to make corrections especially when I didn't make an error!!Of the channels I did get for free, most had a poor selection of viewing choices. If I have to pay al-a-cart for viewing I may as well stick with cable or Red Box."
"431","If you're thinking about getting one of these, I highly recommend it, so much I bought 2, one for the living room and one for the bedroom. Good bye cable, good bye Netflix. This is all you need, super easy to set up and use. The voice control is a bonus!!! Even my kids can use it, with parental controls in the living room."
"432","With only 2 gaming systems I needed a way to connect my other televisions to all my other streaming applications and this was just the thing to do it. I love everything about the fire stick from it's simple user interface and friendly remote to countless capabilities there is no better option for streaming device."
"433","Works great, I am enjoying all the movies provided via AMAZON Prime.  I also enjoy easier/quicker access to my NETFLIX account.  The Fire TV Stick / Prime TV, etc. will soon make cable and dish TV extinct.  The price is great, and it also has so many apps you can get if you want to add to what you view.  This is a great product.  The voice remote is also cool..."
"434","Great concept and excellent execution for cutting the cord.  Simple to operate although the voice control has the same issue as others - sometimes you can't get it to understand what you're saying. My satellite bill was over $80/month; with the Fire Stick and a Sling subscription I'm saving $55 per month and getting all of the channels/shows I want."
"435","Works perfectly, just as advertised.I'm amending my review, now that I've been using the Fire Stick for a month.I've discovered that there is a major design flaw in this product.There is NO way to turn it off, or reset it, without unplugging it.I live in an area where we are having frequent winter storms, which cause power outages.As a result, the Fire Stick loses it's ability to recognize the internet and must be reset....every single time the power goes out.I can't express how annoying it is to have to get behind everything where the wires are hidden from view and unplug the Fire Stick, wait 30-60 minutes for it to reset, then get back there again to plug it in.I've had to do this 8 times in the last two weeks.I'm losing my patience with this."
"436","The product was simple to set up and update with streaming media accounts. The remote is super tiny lol and the batteries included worked fine. Found out that I have to keep the adapter hooked to the stick...didn't like the way it was hanging out from the back of my television, so I detached and you guessed it! TV screen went black! lol Only setback my series watching a bit because of my curiosity. Excellent product. The HDMI extend came very handy when I was inserting/jamming the Fire stick in the HDMI slot and noticed the A/V output were hilarious placed adjacent to the slot making it crazy difficult from me to insert the Fire completely...I ALMOST broke my own television trying to make it work...haha!!! Anyway, got it installed and it's working properly.Thank You"
"437","When we purchased this fire stick we were under the impression that we could watch unlimited shows at no charge.. Boy was that wrong!! There are very few ' free shows'. CBS, ABC DISNEY CHANNEL, etc all have to be downloaded, which isn't the issue.. the issue is in order to getting ALL access you have to activate it using your current cable provider!! Isn't the point of the fire stick to eliminate the monthly payment from cable/satellite?!!On another note, the remote goes thru batteries like crazy.."
"438","I love my Fire Stick. I admit that I am not very tech savvy, and I had to have my son come over and install the thing. And he has had to make a couple of return trips to help me learn how to use it. But after using it for a solid two weeks, I am finally getting more proficient and finding many fantastic things to watch on TV."
"439","So my parents got this for me for Christmas. I have two tvs, one being a smart tv. For the other I have a smart DVD player that was a couple years older. Right away I thanked my parents for it but told them they didn't need to get it for me because of what I already owned. They told me to try it out for a week or so and if I didn't like it then they would return it for me.Well I got back to my place later on that week and holed it up right away. I instantly loved it. Way better options than both my smart tv and the smart DVD player when it came to app choices. I have cable but not in my bedroom so it's now nice being able to stream live tv while laying in bed. So happy that they got this for me and I would recommend it to anyone"
"440","I have the original and now bought the new version.  The problem I have is the remote keeps losing connection.  Even with the latest update installed to the fire stick.  Half the time I have to switch to using my phone to navigate.  This is mainly because I don't know how soon the remote will reconnect.  Sometimes it is right away, other times, may be 15-30 seconds or so."
"441","The Amazon Fire stick is very easy to use. Literally all you need to do is plug-and-play. When the device loads up the first thing you notice is a very well organized user interface powered by an Android operating system. Alexa voice control is also a handy feature as it allows you to search the internet 4 things of interest as well as navigate through the firestick menus. The fire-stick is extremely portable however it vexes me to know that it needs to be plugged into an outlet via an AC adapter much the same way that a cell phone charges. The fact that a flash drive that plugs into an HDMI port would need a power cable is beyond me but it doesn't change the fact that the Amazon Fire stick does exactly what it's supposed to do. Great product."
"442","Exactly what I was looking for! Set up take a solid 2 minutes and you're up and working. Got this for my bedroom tv since I didn't want to pay an extra $15/month to add it to my cable, great to watch shows or movies on."
"443","Pros:DirecTV Now app available.Nice responsivenesslike the home screen layoutcons:No BTN2GO appNo Vudu Appdon't like some app interfaces as well as I do the ROKU. ex. HULU doesn't seem to have a ""home"" shortcut.  So you have to use the back button only to return to your watchlist from a show page, for example.  There are also some HULU layout changes I like better than the ROKU.Bought these because I wanted DirecTV Now while the introductory offer is available.  That app isn't available on ROKU yet.  When I can get directv now on ROKU I will likely switch back to ROKU and the fire stick will be on secondary TV where I am not likely to need BTN2GO or movies on the VUDU app."
"444","Thrilled with this. Saved $100 a month versus traditional cable. Watching tons of shows I love and paying so much less. The remote function is fantastic and particularly like the ""Alexa"" voice commands. Ordered one to 'try it out' and then ordered 2 more for the other TV's in our home. We're 'cable free' now."
"445","My daughter turned me on to this since I have become overwhelmed with new technology. She was right I really enjoy this. I don't even have time to watch everything offered. Something for everyone for sure. I downloaded the NFL app then purchased NFL game pass. So now I can see every game on my time schedule."
"446","Alexa is a great added feature for the fire stick, This version seems much faster than the original. All the apps you want and has such a small footprint. Would recommend this over roku stick, as it just works better. Apps load faster and seem to never crash. For the money I think this is the best streaming stick available now,"
"447","Cons: Power supply requirements can be annoying and establishing network connectivity has its ups and downs. Some Smart TVs pick a fight with itPros: Once you get it working, it really flies. Makes travel so much more enjoyable and allows for business road warriors or vacationing families to binge at will in a comfortable environment at no extra cost since most hotels have free wi-fi. Great Value and comes pre-loaded with your Amazon account settings! Win!!"
"448","Got this to run kodi on my tv and projector and it works great.  The voice remote is cool, and the fact it has blue tooth is also great for when i use my projector outside and need to pair my blue tooth speakers.  The only thing that would be nice is if it could run on the low usb voltage from my tv usb port.  It still does, but will power cycle every once in a while."
"449","You can't beat this product for all that you get for the price. There's almost no point in getting something expensive like an Apple TV when this exists. For $40 you basically get all the stuff Apple TV gives you. It works well and the picture quality is perfect. I don't have cable but I'm always streaming shows on my laptop. Now I can comfortably sit and watch everything on my TV instead of trying to position my laptop awkwardly.You could get a cable to hook up your laptop to your TV, but having this streamlined system with all the apps in one spot makes it so you don't have to get up.I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone that doesn't play video games (with fancy consoles that basically have all this) and to those who love to binge watch shows."
"450","A big improvement over the original Fire stick. My 3 year old original one wore out and now I'm glad it did! The new version has more power, speed and loads more quickly. The new user interface is less burdensome and much faster than the original. Love the voice search option wit's Alexa!"
"451","I bought this for the tv in my bedroom to give myself more movie choices as opposed to having to hook up my laptop with HDMI and stream movies to my tv. It's so much more convenient and the controls and user interface are very easy and pleasant to use. I liked this so much I even got a few as gifts for family members."
"452","Love it, I love the books on the toddler app- they are a fun way to make reading fun for my daughter. There are so many things I haven't even explored yet. I don't really use the voice part-  it isn't that I don't like it, it is just easy to use the remote and I don't think about the voice part."
"453","The Amazon Fire TV Stick is everything , and more, that I had expected. This device expands the benefits of our large screen TV and our fiber optic giga power ATT internet service. The Alexa Voice Remote is icing on the cake. The more that we use the Fire Stick, the better that we undserstand the expansive functions of this Amazon Fire TV Stick. I am an Amazon Prime Member and access to Amazon Prime Movies is among the many Fire Stick benefits."
"454","Alexa where have you been all my life?  We had been using our top-shelf blu-ray player for accessing Amazon Prime, Netflix and YouTube Red (and others) but Fire TV Stick loads and streams twice as fast and offers so much more.  I wish I had known about this amazing product 10 years ago!"
"455","Seriously flawless, and enriches our lives in a thousand ways. We live in a remote rural with crappy expensive cable from an indifferent provider. It's such a relief to be able stream almost anything we want, including FSTV. (Hoping our signal strength remains constant in this uncertain world.)"
"456","With outrageous cable costs, this is a good alternative.  Watch ala carte without paying for unwanted, unwatched programming.  Just about everything is now available.  Be aware any cheap router / modem may not allow this to work to full potential particularly if you have more than one in your house."
"457","I absolutely LOVE this!  The video and audio quality is fantastic on my 1080p 46 in tv. It is quick on changing and ""always on"", so a few clicks on the remote will wake it.  My first experience with wireless video sticks, and I picked this over the Chromecast and AppleTV.  I'm glad I did.  As a Prime member, all features are available.  Reasonable price as well.  I'm going to purchase another for a TV in the guest room!  Alexa also recognizes my voice (check the weather :) ), which previous versions of voice recognition failed to do."
"458","I'm really impressed with the fire stick because I really didn't expect it to do and have all the things it does. My wifi, for one, is a little faster when I connect to my netflix. It has many other options as well, such as connecting to games, amazon movies, tv, and so much more than I ever expected it to have. So very pleased with this."
"459","I would give this 5 stars, but it is aggravating that Amazon charges for many of the things I want to watch. I bought this to get away from expensive television services and I just won't pay for much. It is also aggravating that they throw commercials in and they also will put that I can open many add-ons because I ""own this"" then I get charged."
"460","Love it! Easy to install, just plugged it right in and logged into my amazon account. I watched a YouTube video on how to install Kodi, took me about 30min. Works like a charm and now I'm enjoying all the new movies and TV shows. Also, the fire stick is waaayyyyy faster than my Roku 3 player."
"461","I like having the Fire Stick enough. It takes a while to set it up but a YouTube video walked me through the process step-by-step. Alexa does not respond to me very well and I have to repeat myself several times in order to get where I want to go. Otherwise, it's worth it having a Fire Stick."
"462","As a former TV News producer I am picky about the quality of the video that appears on my 58 inch TV set. Fire stick's output is excellent. It was, in fact, better than what I had been using for Netflix, which was the Dish Network's receiver. Unfortunately Dish elected to ""upgrade"" their software on all their receivers and the new software program had a glitch in it that will not allow Netflix to work. Dish's technical people told me a fix was months away, at best. I was forced to find my own replacement product and Fire Stick fit the bill and was $10 cheaper than a similar item that did not have Alexa voice remote. The small remote is easy to use. Highly recommended, easy to use, works great."
"463","My son gave me his digital TV when he bought a new one. He equipped it with a new Fire Stick and had his son in law program it for me. In general it works great. Occasionally it stalls, however; most of the time it corrects itself. Cable does this, but less often. The most irksome thing I have found with it is it has no guide channel, so you can't see a list of what's on. Considering it's free TV, I guess we can put up with this. I do believe it's well worth the money and would recommend it to others."
"464","Decent product. The clarity of picture is better than with cable TV.  I was hoping though to connect via ethernet cable, but am unable to. The wifi strength is weaker at the distance from which I use it and the obstacles in its path... so sometimes programming pauses and tries to reconnect."
"465","I bought The Fire TV Stick even though I already own an Apple TV and Roku. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it will actually read any books loaded onto my Kindle Paperwhite, turning any book on my Paperwhite into an audio book. Very cool!The main reason I wanted to buy the Fire TV Stick is because I am a big fan of X Ray. I love learning about the actors and all the trivia notes. But this is where I deduct 1 star. Whereas my Kindle Fire can have X Ray on the whole time, the Fire TV makes you keep pressing the button on the remote to see actor's bios. The Fire TV should act like the Kindle Fire in this respect.If I'm missing how to keep X Ray on during a whole episode or movie, can someone tell me how to do it?"
"466","I had decided to try out the fire stick after hearing so many great things from friends and family but after owning the Google Chrome cast since it's inception I was a bit skeptical of anything different. Boy was I surprised! The fire stick exceeded my expectations due to its easy setup startup and integration. I was able to add my Netflix and hulu accounts fast and using Alexa was super easy to learn. My only gripe would be that although the voice commands work with most of the apps it doesn't yet work with all of them but I'm sure this is being worked on as the smart home entertainment category is still within its infancy. If. Whether you are new to owning a HDMI plug&play device or you've had a few I would recommend this one highly."
"467","I found the directions difficult to follow. A better formal would be one by steps. I also found the choice capacity confusing. Thank goodness for techie friends. I continue to be unsure on how to look up a movie to determine if it is available. I'd there a larger manuel that available?"
"468","Still new to this since we've let go of Direct TV, but seems to be fine so far.  I still have a lot to learn.  Just wondering though, I see that some people that have ordered the Fire TV Stick have a $10 movie credits...how do you get that?!  I've bought 3 in the past 2 months and didn't get one on any of them."
"469","Couldn't be any easier to setup.  Should work great at home and for any traveler in a hotel etc. with wifi.  Might be worth 5 stars in the long run, but I've only had it for a few weeks and don't want to over-rate until I have more time to evaluate.  Saving me over $100 a month after I cut the cable and using Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube and plan to subscribe to Hulu Live TV for $40 as Fire TV is now supported."
"470","Although within the US works great, abroad is a whole other history. If you are traveling outside US,  you'll find out that most Amazon prime content is not available, as well as several apps, which will not display any content due to such  external use. Other than that, gives you exactly what you're being offered and paying for, no more no less."
"471","Not sure I know how to work it. It seems that I have to pay for everything I don't understand that so I haven't really been dealing with it until I can get some help."
"472","Way better then the last one. the wifi chip has been improved noticeably, so you don't have to worry about it being right next to a source anymore. the overall browsing and functionality speed has been improved vastly. Alexa voice command is precise and quick it can hear even at low spoken levels."
"473","My wildest dream come true.  There are so many series that I missed.  I was on the slow train and I can't watch a series in the middle; call me anal.  Not only can I binge watch Game of Thrones, I can access The Wire which was one of my biggest regrets.  I now can go back and watch a series that has been off-air and watch every season (The Wire).The $39 cost is ridiculous for what I get in return.  After a 30 day trial period, HBO Now is $15.99 per month to give you a reference.  That is the same, if not less, than it would cost on plain cable.  Add that to an endless supply of entire original programming that no longer is available at your finger tips?  There is no comparison.  I used to be a Netflix junkie, but this is better."
"474","I received this when I signed up for Direct TV Now, I had the choice of this or a Roku Premiere. Having read a lot of good reviews on this and also loving Amazon, I decided to go with the Fire TV Stick. I've only had it for a few days but I love it so far! It's very easy and simple to use, I love the voice feature. I had a Chromecast before and the Fire TV Stick just runs and streams a lot better, loads faster. I'm glad I went with this!"
"475","The product is epic and fantastic. The only issue is I pay alot of money to be a prime 2 day member. I ordered it friday 8am black Friday. With my 2 day prime shipping it said 2 days on the 28th. Once shipped I ended getting it at 10pm or 9pm via UPS and including Sat Sunday and Monday plus Friday as a whole day that 8AM membership technically so it was not 2 days for the expensive prime membership, I got my item in 3 or 4 days. The product is really great has alot of apps and functionality. The misleading shipping issue especially getting a package at 915pm at night 3 or 4 days later was disappointing but this was the first bad I had with amazon. Otherwise amazon and their services have been always helpful and great no issues ever besides this"
"476","Removed Firestick from box, plugged into HDMI port on TV, performed simple set up using Alexa app and I was watching shows on Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, CBS All Access and many more.  Could not be more simple.  I love the ability to find shows and perform functions using Alexa with the Firestick.  Wonderful product at an astonishing price."
"477","I bought this for my bedroom tv because the apps on xboxone tend to often work horribly (especially the sling tv app). The apps on this work great. Sling tv (the app which I primarily use this for) is flawless.  The UI itself is sleek and intuitive,  and the stick is fast. The voice control also works better than any other device that I own. Setup was quick and easy (it already came synced to my amazon account), and the features it has make it a much better option when compared to roku or chromecast (which other friends of mine own,  and to which I compared before buying). If you don't own a smart tv and you're tired of waiting around for developers to fix broken apps on the platforms you already own,  turn this is a good alternative for you."
"478","I own a FireTV stick (1st gen) and two regular FireTV boxes (2nd gen).  The 2nd gen FireTV boxes are my favorite; no idea why Amazon took a tangent on its design with the 3rd gen.  That said, the FireTV stick (2nd gen) is amazing comparative to its 1st gen counterpart.  It is plenty fast on WiFi and is very easy to setup.  Highly recommend!"
"479","The Fire TV Stick is amazing! I haven't had cable in my home for years, as I simply decided I wasn't going to pay hefty fees for something of which I only utilize a very small percentage. So, when I knew my mom was coming up to visit and knowing she loves watching TV, I had to get something fast, simple to use, and inexpensive. The Fire Stick fit the bill! It was very easy to connect, the remote is simple to use and, with my Amazon Prime account, we have an endless supply of movies and shows to watch! I would highly recommend this product!"
"480","I love Alexa works so easy. I had the old fire stick and remote was so tiny. This remote is larger and seems to be more compatible. The actual firestick is a little bit longer and it appears the usb cable might be a tad longer that original firestick.  Overall firestick works great. Was easy to set up and completely user friendly."
"481","Amazon recommendations and channels are too prominent on this device. Amazon channels require subscriptions to each one individually. Let me see MY apps, shows, etc. on the front page. I want everything that's relevant to me where I can easily find and sort through it."
"482","By far one of the best purchases that I’ve made through Amazon. Set up was as simple as taking it out of the box, plugging it into the tv and wall outlet and setting up your account. Searching through Netflix and YouTube is easy and the performance quality is great. Couldn’t be happier."
"483","I am so excited that I made the leap and discontinued cable TV and streaming all the channels for 1/2 the price!  I'm 52 and was a little nervous but turns out using this is easy and the remote with Alexa voice is tremendously cool.  Also enjoy all the extra channels I get from the stick."
"484","Why did I wait to get this. Great for hotels and home. If you travel and don't want to pay insane prices for movies and much, much more the Fire TV Stick is the bomb. Love being able to hit a button and just say ""play song title or artist, movie title etc"" and it just pops up."
"485","These are good products but I would think Amazon would have a manufacturer that could crank them out faster than a 1 month waiting period. Seems crazy to me for the largest retailer in the world. However, the one I have is much more reliable than my other streaming devices. I like it."
"486","New experience for me.  I've cut the cord with cable and this plus an indoor antenna are my replacements.  I'm still getting used to the Fire Stick and what's offered.  Not as much free as I'd expected, but it works great and does give a good number of options - especially with Prime."
"487","I purchased these for my stepdaughter. She visits from college and spends the entire time on her laptop watching netflix. So I figured why not make her TV a smart TV. Now she doesn't have to make more wear and tear on her laptop. It was easy to set up and to use. She hasn't complained of any lag. So far so good."
"488","Love this Fire TV stick!  We ""cut the cord"" with DirectTV so now we only use the Fire Stick for Netflix and Amazon and an antenna for local stations.  The voice activation on the Fire Stick is awesome!"
"489","Cut the cord and using PlayStation Vue for cable networks.  Love both the Fire Stick and Fire TV (own both) Sticks are great for the bedrooms where we only have 720p TVs.  You can't be the combination of low price, high quality and ease of installation with the Fire Sticks.  Will likely buy more in the future."
"490","I just purchased my second Fire TV Stick to replace a cumbersome PC to TV setup I had in the living room. The Fire TV Stick is so easy to set up, it's amazing. It literally takes about five minutes. The interface is simple and easy to navigate. I am a Prime subscriber, Netflix subscriber and pay for HBO and Showtime through our cable company, so being able to access all that through the Fire TV Stick is great. My daughter is also happy with the easy access to PBS Kids, YouTube and Disney. The Fire TV Stick is a winner in our house!"
"491","I really like this fire stick.  The Alexa voice command works well. There are a multitude of apps to access and this is much cheaper than my cable bill.  Very easy to use, just plug it into an HDMI outlet on the back of the TV and into an electrical outlet, tell Alexa which app you want and away you go."
"492","This latest version of the firestick w/ alexa  represents the best value in in streaming video.  It is simple yet slick and you can take it with you easily.  My only con is the that they should include the USB power cord as part of the package, instead of the 110 volt plug in version."
"493","I am very disappointed in the remote it comes with. The batteries it came with burnt out quickly, however I did not know this right away I never figured they would that fast. So I was ready to return entire product cause I thought something was wrong with it all until I went on line and read many reviews about the remote. Also I have the hardest time getting the back off the thing...it could have been designed so you could use a finger nail to move it. Anyways I did find an app on line that allows you to use your smart phones as a remote so used that til i got batteries. Got into one show but I really thought it gave you so much more. Well I am still exploring it so ask me again in 6 months. Remote is now working with new batteries"
"494","Works great, easy to set up and I love the voice application. I bought one for my mother who is 83. She would have had a hard time trying to work through the maze of apps so the voice feature makes it so easy for her to find the things she likes to watch. Five stars and two thumbs up."
"495","This was so worth it! - Especially for the price.  Until now I've been switching back and forth between my apple tv and my playstation since one doesn't have amazon video and the other doesn't have hbogo or hulu.  This was SUCH a low cost alternative - and it was SO easy to install and use.  Must have - thanks Amazon for giving us something to watch movies/tv on that doesn't cost and arm & a leg :)"
"496","I'm late to the Fire TV Stick scene, but boy do we love it!  Even an 81 yr old dude can learn to navigate with this thing.  The Amazon Prime movies are our go-to default...next we'll hit the Amazon series.  Super easy to install.  Directions were easy to follow.  What's not to Love?!"
"497","Love this Firestick.  I had a Roku before for a few years before it started giving me problems, so I decided to try theFirestick.  It was easy to set up, and works like a charm, and much cheaper than a new Roku.  Have not tried the Alexa feature yet.  Would highly recommend it."
"498","This is an awesome product, especially when combined with Amazon Prime.  It took me a little while playing with the controls to figure out exactly what they do - still playing with the voice commands.Also still learning about the Apps which hold incredible possibilities.I'm glad I bought 3 of these.  May get another one."
"499","Love the fire stick. I'm a bit of a design geek so I was impressed by the packaging, very organized and clean. The set up was super simple and took a matter of minutes to get it all plugged in and then hooked up to wifi and my Amazon account. We got it to use with our Direct Tv now subscription and the app on the firestick has a lot of buffering issues as well as connectivity problems. We don't have nearly as many problems with the directv now app on our phones/tablets (on he same wifi) as we do the firestick, which is why I give it 4 stars. I really wish it had the Nick JR app on it as well since my kids love some of those shoes and the directv app doesn't work well with the fire stick apparently. Overall it's a great buy though."
"500","I got this thing in mail today and got it up and running in about 15 minutes. I'm too busy enjoying this product to write a full review. Bye!"
"501","Pros.  It is a great piece. Not expensive but works great. Easy to set up, I can stick it to any monitor with HDMI and rigth away starts watching movies - its portability is awesome, I even use it on my Honda Display (Non- navi) and can mirror it with my phone for a big screen navigation.Cons. The arrangement of items on the screen seems confusing at first. Repeated display of previously seen items (skin) is almost seen in every category which makes it look a bit disorganized."
"502","Easy to connect and does everything I expected and read. I cut the cord on cable and about 125 of 130 useless channels that I spent hours scrolling through.  I can get the depressing news on my phone and the weather from Alexa on my Echo Dot.  Oh... And saving about $100 a month by going internet only."
"503","Pros:- Lets you access Amazon videos and a few apps (channels) on non-smart devices.- It is portable.- It does have a voice remote (though I'm not likely to use it).Cons:- The design of the device will most likely take up the hdmi spot next to the hdmi location you plug the stick into, either by width of the stick or by the location of power plug, unless you use a adapter.- The included hdmi extension/adapter is on the small side.- The remote response seems to have a slight lag (minimal) compared to other remotes, such as cable box and stereo receiver remotes.Note: I did not purchase the the Fire Tv Stick w/ Alexa from Amazon. It was part of my cable package from DirecTv."
"504","This Firestick is a amazing media streaming device. Amazon has increased the power of this Firestick. I was using a Gen 1 and I have noticed a significant increase in the speed. I was able to stream with no buffering thanks to the power this stick has. I definitely recommend getting this."
"505","I had the original version and decided to buy another one on sale using Alexa for some extra credit towards our account.  The new one is a little fatter than the original but there is an extension included if you need the space.  I have had all the media streaming sticks and think that this one has the best experience of all of them.  This is noticeably faster than the original and it looks like they are not pushing the new look to the older models but this one and our FireTV have been updated.  I take this thing everywhere I travel and use it in hotel rooms or in the ski condo to watch my shows.  Has become a needed travel accesory and for the price cannot be beat if you are a prime member, netflix, hbo, and showtime subscriber."
"506","The fire stick is exactly what we were wanting, it allows us to watch the shows/channels  we want without the high cost of cable/satellite bill. I can have a firestick for every room with a TV now. No longer a Direct TV customer after 15yrs, but it has saved our family budget  $130 a month ( this is after the initial first month of buying the 2 firesticks, savings in our monthly budget including what we pay for channels, Hulu and Netflix included). Like anything, there is  slight learning curve, but system was very easy to set up and use. If you have a smart phone you can even down app as a remote. Voice remote has been handy especially when you want to search for a specific program. Our family has been pleased with this product."
"507","The fire stick is awesome device. Especially for the price. I purchased mine on Black Friday for $29  I installed it the day it arrived, and it came pre-programmed with my Amazon account info. All I had to do was enter the password,  and connect to our home Wi-Fi. The menu was very intuitive. We were fully functional within a half hour. This is especially useful if you have Amazon prime, which gives you  access to premium content. There were many  movies that had recently completed their theater runs . Although I was not interested  additional content, there were other options such as Hulu and Netflix. We had just converted to one of the new LCD TVs, replacing  our old tube set. So this is an excellent supplement to our cable TV."
"508","This has been great for many reasons but the main reason I love it is becasue my smart TV is always having issues with the hulu app for some reason ( all of our other devices work great with the app, it's just our tv itself that even support can't figure out why, my son's tv does the same thing with hulu so it's not just the one). With the fire stick it loads up right away and plays instantly and so far everything else works great on it too. Super easy to hook up and use. We also have another one for our not smart ( app free) TV and is great for being able to have all the apps we can get on other devices all accessible via the fire stick. Have not messed with Alexa on it too much but everything seems great so far. I highly recommend this!"
"509","The Amazon FireTVStick with Alexa is fantastic and still a big plus if you already have a smart TV or smart DVR Blueray player for (3) specific reasons that I noticed right away.1) Alexa voice control gives you a fantastic interface to access music, videos and misc Internet stuff.2) The remote control is amazing for being so simple but yet has everything you need to access internet apps with the typical more complex remotes that are provided with smart BlueRay DVD players.3) The ability to download many additional apps and updates than comes with smart TVs and BlueRay devices.4) In addition Amazon provides other Video services (some free with prime) and other you pay for."
"510","UPDATE:I have now upped my review to 4/5 because the problem was resolved. However, I had to contact my tv company & go through a long chat trying to resolve the issue. The problem would have been easily resolved had there just been a simple calibration setting on the Fire Stick itself.I was really excited about this product. Set was incredibly easy & I love how it functions. My main problem is the fact that I cannot adjust the display to match my tv. I have read that this is a known problem & the screen tells me to adjust my tv settings. I have done so & still is cutting off the picture. Will likely return the device due to this problem & find another option."
"511","This is definitely the best purchase I've made from Amazon Prime!! Saving money on my Dish Network by downgrading to basic level due to the Fire Stick. It installed perfectly and easily. Not one glitch! Watching so many movies and TV shows for free saves me big money. Can't say enough about it!"
"512","Got this because my blu-ray disc player's built in wifi was lagging badly.  Streaming movies would stop with audio continuing, then suddenly catch up.  Or not play at all.  Under advisement got the fire stick. WOW!!! Night and day! NO lag/drag.  My old player had about 8 apps to choose, this Firestick has HUNDREDS!  No joke.  Everything and anything.  Plus, I can connect my blu-ray headphones to the stick and listen privately to my heart's content. Simply AMAZING.Don't know how I managed for so long without it.Get it, you won't regret it..."
"513","The Fire TV stick is amazing and is so easy to get started and enjoying movies and shows.  I have had the apple tv since it first came out and I actually like this better. It is small so you can take it on trips and plug it into the hotel tv or vacation house tv.  Very great product!"
"514","I was so tired of wanting to watch something good on TV and being limited to sports (which I find boring), news, and . . . . .  Then my son suggested the Fire Stick.  Oh, my!  Now I have my choice of movies, documentaries, or just good music.  My evenings are SO much more interesting.  It's been life-changing for me."
"515","Already had a Fire TV, and wanted to try a Fire Stick. Product works good. I thought Stick received its power from tv rather than a separate power cord. Aside from them cheaper price than the Fire TV, i would rarher have the Fire TV. There is more RAM with the TV which helps with buffering if yoy have slower internet"
"516","Very good deal with prime membership. Lots of movies to watch for free, some you have to pay for.  Access to Netflix Hulu etc.  Plus free two day shipping on Amazon prime orders. Can't go wrong  when you consider Netflix or Hulu by themselves cost as much up as a prime membership per year"
"517","So far so good, it was very simple to get started and seems to respond very quickly. That was my goal.  I had been using a bluray dvd player but lately it was soooo slow, lagging, etc.  You can't beat the price and I like the voice feature, even though I haven't used it much.  Kind of cool."
"518","Why didn't I do this sooner?! I had roku box and thought it was great. This is way better! Easily portable, gorgeous interface, better quality picture and way more options. Plus, the screen saver is full of gorgeous pictures. Get rid of that roku already! It's junk compared to this!"
"519","They were an easy install and work great on my Samsung televisions!  Everything else looked so complicated to me.  My nephew steered me toward this...I bought two of them...one for the upstairs and one for the downstairs televisions.  Would do it again.  Love the ALEXA voice remote!"
"520","Great way to connect to our router. Much faster with no buffering with the little extender provided.Previously I was using the link in my Blue Ray player to connect to my router, Firestick is much faster. What I haven't figured out is how to link my headphones 🎧 to the Firestick."
"521","I have Amazon Prime and was streaming Amazon Video it to my TV using Apple TV mirroring. That experience was glitchy - the Amazon audio on the movie or TV program would continue but the video would start over. If that doesn't make sense don't worry because it does not really matter. The point is that I ordered the Fire Stick to play Amazon Video and it is playing like a charm. It also has Alexa Remote that allows you to give voice directions to the device. That seems to work pretty well although I am too new to that specific technology to say much more than that. One thing I think I will like about the Fire Stick is that it is quite portable so I can take it to other locations like to the house we've rented in Tucson for a week."
"522","Great product and easy to use with the nifty remote and voice complaint! Only complaint is that you can't easily access Youtube using the Fire Stick. However, before purchasing I was well aware of this and since I already have Chromecast this is a non-issue.Out of Roku, Fire, and Chromecast though, I would rank in the following order: 1. Roku, 2. Fire, 3. Chromecast. This is because Roku allows you use access Amazon videos (Chrome does not) and casting Youtube with ease. I personally do not like casting things over my already very old and slow phone so Chromecast is out for me. I do prefer Fire stick's remote over the Roku remote. All in all, I am very happy with the Fire stick and uses it for everything but Youtube!"
"523","I got my fire tv stick today and it was extremely easy to setup. I purchased it because I wanted to watch particular video game web content on my tv. I thought the app only existed on Apple TV and I was loathe to pay $150 for the privelege. Well I found out the app I wanted was on the fire stick and I’m happy to say so far I really like it! The voice command on the remote is cool. I said the name of the app I wanted and it brought me right to the spot to download it. I can’t wait to see what else it can do, but I am elated to watch my favorite gaming moments on the big screen now instead of my 11 inch laptop.I managed to get it on cyber Monday so the price was even better than usual, but I think it would be worth $40"
"524","I like the functionality. I was using the PlayStation 4 to handle watching Amazon Prime, Neflix and HBO NOW, but starting the PlayStation and opening the proper app was tedious. The Fire TV Stick was much better, it is instant on and the interface for superior. However the reason for only 3 stars is because it is very very slow to navigate between items. So slow that I almost always ended up selecting the wrong show or episode because it was behind my selection.But since I liked the basic functionality and interface so much, I bought the Amazon Fire TV. That is excellent and I highly recommend."
"525","I love the Fire TV Stick and it works great. I also cut the cable cord and have Playstation Vue now, which is also great and works very well with the Amazon Fire TV Stick. I really like how I can talk into the remote and find what I want to watch at ease. Amazon has really made my transition to streaming online very easy."
"526","I love the TV options this provides, as my Blue Ray player limited me to just Netflix before. Amazon Prime streaming rocks, without buffering or constant loading, just seamless binge watching. I'm beyond glad I finally upgraded!"
"527","The device is working perfectly so far. I've had it about a month. No problem logging onto Netflix, Amazon Prime or YouTube.My only complaint is the remote control. It's smallish and the case has a pointy area that digs into my  palm. My hand gets pretty sore using it.Not as ergonomic as it should be.IMO.Jim"
"528","Why didn't I order this sooner? Oh, maybe because they were so popular Amazon wasn't shipping them until a few weeks ago. Set up was super easy, and now I have to limit my viewing because there are SO MANY GREAT PROGRAMS on that i want to just lock the door and binge for the rest of my life! OK, maybe not all my life...I do enjoy a good hike and wine with friends.  Seriously, this is just amazing. Good voice recognition, easy navigation, hooks into my Netflix and other services... just amazing."
"529","It's okay for the cost. I am not unhappy with the product, but I do find it a little lacking. In the time that we've owned it, I've found that the Alexa voice response only works for Amazon itself. If you ask Alexa to go to a specific app, or search something within an app other than Amazon it will take you out of your current app and back in to Amazon. So unless you watch a lot of prime programming or shop from your tv, its not really that useful. Also the remote seems to have a somewhat limited range? Our couch is about 10 feet from the stick and sometimes it doesn't respond.  I bought it on sale for 29.99 and that seemed fair enough for access to Netflix and Hulu on my TV, but ultimately I'd have been happier with chromecast."
"530","This was the greatest purchase. I was having trouble getting my TV to recognize my Internet after a storm and couldn't get back on Netflix. After talking with Verizon,Netflix , my TV company  after disconnecting everything I had no luck. I have been hooking up my computer to the TV but it was annoying. Then I came upon an ad for a fire stick by Amazon the reviews for terrific so I decided to purchase it for $39.00.  The reviews said it would take about 3 and that's all it took ."
"531","Faster than the previous fire stick and I'm still using the TV's USB for power.  Same disclaimer that USB power is not the supplied USB power adapter but I'm glad I don't have to use external power supply.  I'm about to cancel my cable so, this is great option.  My cable provider requires a mini box and that's not going to work for me since I have more than 15 TV's in my house.  This solve part of my problem and I just need to have whole house antenna to get local channels."
"532","This device works great!!  It is easy to use and very easy to navigate through all the different screens.I had an Android box before and this device was terrible, what a confusing mess the Android was.  I had SO much trouble with this device, it was a real nightmare.  The Fire Stick is the complete opposite.  What a difference!  I have not had any problems at all.  I would highly recommend this device.  It works great!"
"533","This is my first Fire TV Stick and so far 8m really enjoying the use. I'm not familiar with the UI layout but so far I've been able to navigate and find what i want. I can't speak for the comparison of Alexa, it's not a feature that I use on any of my electronics. Overall very satisfied with what I have experienced."
"534","We actually ordered one for our living room. I loved it so much we ordered another one for our bedroom. This is awesome and I use it everyday. I usually only watch TV at night because I am so busy. Night time is my relaxation time and I love to catch up on my favorite shows. Thanks"
"535","wonderful product. Works well. I would rate it 5 stars but for one thing--it just will not let me get the closing credits at full size. I want to see the credits, not pictures related to the next episode. That bugs me; I hate having to search an episode on Google to find a name I should be able to just SEE."
"536","Beats the chrome stick and roku soundly. I love this thing and with prime I have more programming than I can Shake a stick at!!!! I purchased one for all of the TVs in the house to access my Plex server Hulu and Netflix. It even plugged into my projector for super easy watching...."
"537","I had the version that came out right before this one with the voice remote. Remote broke after a year. Luckily I could still use an iPhone app to control it. The stick still worked great for Netflix and Amazon, but way lagging and buffering while using Kodi. This new one is working well so for with Kodi, no buffering. It's still in the same location as the old one. I did the simplest install of kodi 17.3 using the app downloader. Much faster than any other way to install kodi. Love this product again. Thought I was going to have to buy the fire tv to use kodi again. Nope! Thanks"
"538","This thing is GREAT!!!  Amazon is SO MUCH better than Netflix or Hulu as far as movie choices. From obscure 70's exploitation movies, hard to find Italian Gore gems, Classics, Rifftrax and just SO MUCH MORE!!  Not just the standard ""Blockbuster Video"" type of hollywood crap.  And this device makes it even easier! Very cool."
"539","solid. I tried a Roku streaming stick, and this within the same week. The Roku does not hold its own against the Fire TV Stick. Alexa voice control is good. Lots of cool features there. You can even check the status of your Amazon product shipments. Music search is great. The controllers feels nice. The Roku felt a little awkward to navigate with. Whats with the funny fabric tab at the bottom of the Roku remote? The Fire remote works, and is intuitive.  I found myself blindly navigating, going home, and searching without glancing down at the remote after a few minutes of use.Navigating around the menus is again easier in the Fire TV. Roku's felt a little deadened, and they are not making a subtle approach to ""up-selling"" you."
"540","I Love my new fire stick, it has taken on a new meaning to my television. I have enjoyed many movies with the ease of my fire stick letting me choose what to watch on a big screen television. I can't say enough good about the fire stick and hopefully will never be without one. Thank You!!"
"541","The Fire TV Stick is absolutely amazing!Drop your cable today and get a Firestick. It plugs you into an online world of internet streaming and if you want a cheap alternative to cable, then I highly suggest you buy an Amazon Fire TV Stick!Worth every penny!!"
"542","Almost does it all.  I got it for the free sling player app that you can download to the fire stick, which lets me us my Slingbox at home while I'm traveling.  The Alexa remote needs some refinement, but can be a handy thing to wow your friends with.  Still there are too many ""I can't help you with that right now"" replies.  Picture quality is excellent.  PLEX app allows me watch videos I have on my computer through the network.  Amazon prime subscribers will find a ton of free movies and tv shows to watch."
"543","Ordered the new fire stick with Alexa voice remote to replace my older one. It is worth the price. It's faster and has easier user interface. Having Alexa voice control is also a nice addition. Alexa makes typing things so much easier compared to using the remote to scroll from letter to letter.  I use the Amazon firestick as my primary TV source (Amazone streaming along with Netflix and other services) since I no longer pay for cable. Overall a good investment."
"544","I absolutely love my Fire Stick! I was trying to decide between the Fire Stick and Roku and am so happy I decided on this! I am able to effortllessly stream Beachbody on Demand and rent movies. Definitely beats the DVD player we used to use. I am extremely satisfied with this product and encourage anyone considering it to BUY it!! Totally worth every penny!"
"545","I love it. Decided to get this for our bedroom TV, since we've been using the PS3 for years & it's literally like a heater (living in a hot climate, this is not a desirable effect). No more hot bedroom & we love the layout of the apps. Only complaint is that sometimes the response is a little slow."
"546","I love this product. We have had AppleTV's in the past, and while they are also a great way to stream, Amazon's Fire Stick is at a more affordable price with similar features. The setup could not have been easier and it is so easy to use. I love all the integration with your AmazonPrime account whether it's music, videos, photos, etc. It's all at your fingertips. Highly recommend!"
"547","Bought a fire TV unit a few months ago and decided I needed one on every TV in the house. This thing is great, the shows available are awesome, can't wait for my cable contract to expire so I can cancel and just have internet. No need for cable or landline phone. Get the stick and binge watch show after show!"
"548","I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT! I have been a Chromecast user for the past few years. I will NEVER go back. First off, the remote and Alexa rock. Second, I don't have issues with casting from my phone. I love that the apps are stored on there for use. My favorite part is that I can watch things from amazon without screen mirroring and I can watch my Dish Network app and treat it just like while at home. Using the guide and dvr with the remote in ways I could not before."
"549","I switched to the Fire TV stick after using Chromecast for 2 years for the sole purpose to be able to stream Amazon Prime TV and movies. What I wasn't expecting was the additional ease and convenience of the Fire TV stick. Not only is it way quicker and easier to set up then Chromecast, the interface is pleasing to the eye (I'm a mac user), AND you don't need to use your phone! Buh-bye Chromecast app on my phone, hello remote! It's easy to log into to your apps like Hulu and Netflix, all of which can be saved right to the home screen for easy switching back and forth. And, let's be honest, Alexa makes everything more easy and fun!"
"550","Love it!! I had run out of things I was interested in watching on Netflix and am blown away by the vast Prime video offerings! It's so easy to get it set up, too! Just plug it into an HDMI port in the back of your TV, follow a few set-up prompts and BAM! You're watching some 2nd series or movie that you'll love! 😊"
"551","I finally broke down and ordered a fire stick. After months of people saying I should. I already had a chrome cast so I figured I didn't need a fire stick too. Goodness I am glad I did! So much different and it came about the time I found out I had strep so lots of streaming happened"
"552","Prime searching is difficult to differ from the other offerings. You almost need to know what you're looking for specifically in order to obtain searches that are included with Prime. Showtime, Starz, Rentals, Purchases all search together. I've yet to figure out how to filter out during a voice search. If there is a way, it's not intuitive."
"553","Loving it! What I really enjoy is the options for Closed Caption (CC). I have Amazon and Netflix on my main TV, but the CC is nowhere as clear and bold as that on the Fire TV Stick. I find myself taping all my favorite shows on the bedroom TV. I will probably get another Fire Stick for the main TV now."
"554","I absolutely love this thing. The voice search across all of your apps/subscriptions makes everything so easy and instant. I was dubious about getting this rather than the ethernet connected model (which would have been another $40) as my internet is not especially high speed, and I have an old modem. But so far, I have had no issues. The quality of the image is probably slightly lower than I was previously getting through ethernet, but I do not notice it anymore.The only thing I find with Amazon Prime is that it is not very reliable at keeping track of which episodes you have watched, so you often have to remember where you got to. Otherwise, this is a fantastic product, and one of the best $40 I have spent this year."
"555","Everything it is advertised to be. Streaming has really come a long way in a short time, and is the future. Works great on my Vizio Smart TV through the HDMI port. Has not gotten hot so far, even though it runs all the time in the background if you're using another input. A lot of great apps, some available at no extra charge. Carried my Netflix account over from my Bluray. Also has HULU available for separate subscription. Have not found VUDU yet, don't know if it carries that. Would highly recommend it, just for the programming (The Night Manager is excellent, and CBS all access will ""eventually"" have the new Star Trek - Discovery show on it (no where else in US and Canada, on Netflix everywhere else on our planet."
"556","Love this Fire TV Stick!. Its Sleek and fits right behind the TV! Used this for a lot of YouTube and Netflix videos.The package includes everything needed for installation. Received the Fire Stick device, Remote Control with Alexa Voice Control, 2 Batteries for remote, Power Adapter with micro USB cable and an HDMI Extender.Setup was really easy, all you have to do is plug into the TV and attach the power cable to it and you're good to go.An Amazon Account is needed to work this device but most apps are free to install. (Subscription to apps Needed to watch)The all new Amazon Fire Stick is pretty fast for a small unit like this. Remote is very responsive and no need to point to the device for control."
"557","I would have given it 5 stars but would not work with my Onkyo receiver.  It would not wake and only have a black screen unless I unplug & plug it back in or use the two button restart.  I swapped it with the older version I had on my bedroom tv and it wakes fine and the new one works with my bedroom tv.  I have seen other mentions on forums of problems with some a/v receivers and the new fire stick having a problem with the HDCP handshake (High bandwidth Digital Copy Protection)."
"558","While the Fire Stick functioned quite well the ability to easily find free movies is cumbersomeand as far as I can tell limited to a basic selection without having to individually check eachmovie for it's payment status. There should be a menu that would allow you to browse all freemovies available at any given time. If your willing to pay-to-play then your selection is endless."
"559","Was apprehensive about buying it after some of the frustrated reviews, but I've had it a week or so and it is great! Easy install and interface. Perfect for Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Music, all in one easy spot. Traveling next week and will take it w us for the airbnb. Very satisfied."
"560","We've had this device for about a week. It works great. Haven't had any issues with it buffering or anything. Works well.The only issue we've had is with PlayStation Vue. The app needs to be updated badly. Runs slower than it did on my PlayStation 3, which we bought this device so we could stop using the PS3 that was having a lot of problems. Fast forwarding has it's issues sometimes when you are watching a DVR'd show. Other apps work great though. Hoping the PS Vue app gets fixed soon. Just assuming the PS Vue app works this poorly on any device that's not a PlayStation."
"561","One of the best TV streaming devices available and a bargain at that. I just wish it could also accept Google Chromecast and then it would be brilliant and worthy of 5 stars. Voice search is excellent, and you can tell that the processor is fast. It is clearly the most powerful of the stick streamers with no lag whatsoever. It is very snappy in everything you tell it to do. I like that about it. It is clearly a versatile device, with the capacity to install and run Kodi with all that brings. If you are after a Kodi streamer, this is one of your best choices. Highly recommended!"
"562","I have both the fire stick and the roku and the fire stick works 10x better than the roku and has a much better set up. I use this mostly for Netflix and its perfect.  I thought it was so great and easy to use I got one for my 80 year old mother and it is so simple and straightforward to use she learned it in one day!"
"563","My take on this device is that it works well, once you get accustomed to it.  I was under the mistaken impression that you just click on an icon, such as Netflix, and start watching.  That is not the case.  You have to download an app and then open it.  That's not a problem once you figure that out.  But if your a bit tech challenged, as I am, it does require adjustments on your part.  The voice/speech control works well, is easy to use, and saves time.  I have 2 gripes.  It is that it is hard if not impossible to get live, local TV.  Then again, there may be an app somewhere that does this for you.  Secondly, try as I might, I have been unable to cast anything at all.  But I will concede that this may be a reflection of my tech savvy, or lack thereof."
"564","FireTV Stick really does what it was meant to do: take you to over 5000 channels, etc. But please, you have to subscribe to any channelif you wish to view their movies. Is that the same for Amazon Video and Prime? I have not ventured there yet. However, FireTVStickfunctions flawlessly."
"565","I love this new FIre TV Stick. We have another one on a second TV that does not have the Alexa Voice Remote. Really nice to be able to use the voice one. So much easier. Only thing that would be nicer is if the Alexa would work with Netflix, etc. You can get to other applications but not use within the app. itself. Other than that I love it."
"566","I love the interface. Simple and easy to use.Having a direct connect to my Prime Music streaming is awesome as well. Only thing that isn't intuitive is having to use the on-screen keyboard menus (Ew). Thankfully the voice button minimizes the need to use it and it is super convenient."
"567","Great!! Wonderful... why pay for 300 channels you may never watch, pay for renting a movie for one night and pay for additional for movie packages, that THEY put together that don't have that ONE MOVIE you wish to see again... especially when you work 40 plus hours a week and must catch up on other things during the weekend?  Waste of $140 a month that also sews you into a contract for one or two years and penalties for ""early outting""...  Or $29.99 for each service (you at least need 2), plus additional charges per month, just to watch a few times a month? With this...I CAN FIND ANY MOVIE I've seen in the last 30-40 years...at anytime!!!  Thanks Firestick!!!! We are a family that has at least one in almost all of our homes!!"
"568","Well, we got the Fire Stick and were really excited.  Had a bit of a time getting it programmed as video tutorials were for a somewhat different version of the product we received (and we're not very techno).  Anyway, we got it going and it's been great.  We're still learning and experimenting, and looking forward to taking advantage of all it can do!  I am missing real time TV and am looking into apps we can utilize to address that issue."
"569","I like this fire tv a lot but ROKU is still a lot better for apps an easier to find what you need but I enjoy telling fire tv to show my video cameras on my tv works great for that plus it has Alexa built in great for that I think if you buy this you will like it. Amazon is great"
"570","I haven't had cable in awhile and been about to go crazy without watching my favorite shows and watching movies! I've been searching for a great streaming device to connect to my wifi so I can watch stuff on. While searching I came across the firestick and I've heard so many good things about this device! I've never heard anything bad about it all. Everyone that I've spoke with just loves thing!So the next thing I was searching for is the cheapest price to order this firestick streaming device. I've searched high and low to find the best bargains and prices. The cheapest price that I came across was on Amazon! Amazon was offering this firestick for $39.99 and I had $5.00 in app credit. So I ordered this fire stick and got it for about $37 something including taxes and all! You can't beat that!!I think everyone needs one of these devices! You can watch anything on this device and it has so many apps that you can download. It will save you a ton of money! Cable and satellite is so expensive anymore! Between cable and satellite the bills will run you close to $100 a month depending on the package that you get, if not more. That's not even including internet!! With the firestick you just pay the $39.99 plus tax as a one time fee then your good to go! If you have more than one tv, then you will need one firestick per tv.I am such a big fan of the fire stick that I will be purchasing other devices for my other tv's. I am so happy with my decision to try this amazing device out! Theirs no way that I would go back to cable! I love saving money and I LOVE the fire stick!!"
"571","Have been using the new Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote and it is the best.  It works easily. I do not have to do a search anymore using the old method which save considerable time.  I highly recommend upgrading from the original or buying for the first time. This beautiful product is working so well, it is making this Fire TV Stick the King--Like Elvis!!"
"572","I'm enjoying the programming available on the Amazon Firestick with Prime. It may allow me to cut my cable bill by offering the premium channels that I like to watch such as HBO, Showtime and Starz with subscriptions.Howerever, one thing about the firestick that I don't like is that I can't connect it to my sound system(sound bar). It's very frustrating that I can't use my enhanced audio for watching the shows. If there is a way to do it I haven't found it yet. So that's why I can't rate it 5 stars."
"573","Update: Apparently Netflix did an upgrade and now everything works as it should.We have purchased the Amazon Fire TV stick in the past with no issues.We ordered 2 more recently and neither of them allow us to use Netflix.If we want to watch Netflix, we have to pull the older version out of it's locationto use where we want to watch it.Everything else works but Netflix. We've tried all the ""fixes"" suggested and NOTHING works.Spent an entire afternoon trying everything suggested and it has been such a waste.Not pleased with whatever changed between the older version and this new one."
"574","I have to say I LOVE the Fire TV Stick!!!  Best purchase. I'm not tech savvy but you don't need to be.  The instruction book is tiny meaning IT'S EASY TO USE!!!!  I use it all the time.  I haven't fully committed to getting away from cable but honestly, I'm getting closer every day!"
"575","We have been quite pleased with the Fire Stick.  The unit is quick and responsive, and the apps work well.  The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it seems that any time that Amazon Instant Video offers something that is also available on Hulu or Netflix, I only get the search results from Amazon, even though it may be a rental or purchase item (not free on Prime, etc)"
"576","The Fire Stick is great.  It's all that I expected. It came packaged very well and was super easy to setup.  I have Prime so this was working within seconds of attaching it to my non-smart 60 inch Panasonic.  Now the tv is just as smart as all the others, and I think better with the Fire Stick.I'm thinking of getting 2 more for my other dumb tv's in the house.  I might even get the Fire TV box for the main 60 incher.  I also love the voice remote on this new model of the Fire Stick.  With voice command, it changes the HDMI port to the No. 2 which is where the Stick is attached within seconds and I never leave my comfy couch.  So many things to watch it's mind boggling.Thank  you Amazon for this great product."
"577","I opened my Amazon app with no intention whatsoever to buy one of these but there was a pop up on the home page that these were on sale for $35 so I thought to myself hey why not the streaming device in my bedroom is outdated and can't even run Hulu anymore so I ordered it. I did the free shipping option waited 3 days, and no word on it being shipped so I sent a message to Amazon and the amazing customer service appologized for the inconvenience and switched it over to priority 1 day shipping for free! The next day I had my Fire stick which was super easy to set up and I love all of the available apps and voice remote. Hard to believe these only cost $35 to $40 bucks! Save your money get one of these instead of Apple tv."
"578","With just an Amazon account:  makes it easier that browsing on a PC.  that is because of the ""voice commands"".  say a word and it will search for it.  like a title , actors name,  type -like thriller, ect.. and it list.  BUT the best part I like is that if you have an NETFLIX account, HULU, ect. and say search: it searches across installed apps and places all in one palce.  saves time checking Netflix, then checking amazon..ect.and the parental controls actually are useful and work; and I do recommend setting them up, even if you just block purchases.  So, if someone is using it they need the admin password before buying that 3.99 movie and taking up a chunk of your space with a movie YOU DID NOT WANT - EVER."
"579","Pro: Easy to use, plug and play, has everything you want plus you can download apps to suit your viewing preferences.Cons: if you accidentally sit/sleep on the remote control it will as reset the Fire TV Stick to factory setting meaning you'll have to re-download your viewing preference  all over again.Otherwise, I would highly recommend this Fire TV Stick to my friends and family."
"580","We love the flexibility we have wit the Fire TV Stick. Most of the time it's great. Sometimes there's a lot of buffering that slows down the viewing, but this could be the Internet in our area. It's nice to be able to watch on demand. We've given several of these as gifts as well."
"581","The Fire Stick does exactly what it says it will do. Easy hook-up (though I did call for help). Many great programs through Amazon.. Big problem was the amount of data used in short period of time because of streaming. My bad.  For those of you who have this covered, get it today."
"582","Pretty neat so far! I dig it! Just wondering why it's so much more expensive than the roku. I know it has the voice thing but that's not that big of a deal to me. You still have to be holding the remote to use the voice activation so why not just push a button and do it by hand."
"583","This is a beautifully designed product that makes streaming your Amazon Prime video a breeze.  They put a lot of effort into making this a user friendly experience from set up to navigation.  If you can plug in a USB drive, you can set this Fire TV stick up in less than one minute.  The interface is very impressive and intuitive and navigation is simple.  The voice recognition is phenomenal, for those of you who have struggled with Siri to still understanding what you are saying.  Well done!"
"584","Is newest version as of 2017. Runs apps very fast..lightning speed, purchased so wife could watch her Vietnamese TV apps. So many free vietnamese tv apps for 100's of channels . Also, since I have no smart TV  I use it for youtube and Netflix many other apps for my 60 inch samsung...HD looks great"
"585","Mine works ok from time to time. I been lately getting alot crashing & it would turn off on its own. I googled why & alot of people have same issue. Some say can plug into usb for power only wall outlet & most say it dosent doesn't have enough ram memory to run application. design flawless, alexa feature is nice but if u want to run 3rd  applications such as kodi or Netflix forget bout it, especially with the new update amazon did it crashes more frequently."
"586","I have Amazon Prime. I bought this product as a GIFT, but did not ""check mark"" GIFT before ordering ( wonder if that would make a difference) well my friend plugs in and MY LOG IN information was preprogrammed on this product. NOT COOL. I get that they want to make it convenient for the PRIME member to activiate this item. BUT it also makes it easy for others as well!! to have my account info. I would of appreciated it to be known that and/or have a CHOICE to have my information on this product. If I buy for others I need to be able to feel safe that others cannot access my information. Does anyone know how to avoid this from happening?? If I buy the Echo for someone guess my information will be on there as well??"
"587","Love it. Works wonderfully. I'm really impressed how well the internal WiFi antenna works well across my whole house. I've tried the Roku express because I got a free one when signing up for sling and it doesn't even compare. bluetooth voice controlled remote works really well  too."
"588","I like the format of the 2nd generation screen better than the 1st, but both work for me.  This adds Alexa wiht the remote and that is very handy, although you'll still use the push buttons quite a bit to fine-tune your selections and searches.  I love Fire TV.  This was a nice upgrade to the original in my opinion."
"589","This works way better than our old Ruku. Very fast, I just have the basic cable speed internet and I haven't had it stop yet to refresh or reload. Very simple to use and I like how the home screen has all your apps for fast access. I would strongly recommend this over other TV streaming devices."
"590","Overall a great substitute to tv, but some issues need to be addressed...1 Had issues with the remote staying paired to the stick. Had to reset the stick twice before it finally took hold and stayed paired.2 Alexa only understands selections under Amazon. When asked about starting apps, selections in Netflix or going into settings for things by voice, she gets confused or doesn't understand.3 Big one. Has a huge problem with 2.4 ghz band. When I logged it into a 5 ghz band, it was fine, with little or no lag. But 2.4 ghz band almost won't run, despite the hardware that was built into it.Overall, not bad. Have used it for most tv watching, despite issues. Will be looking forward to updates."
"591","After looking around I for smart TV stick I decided to by the Amazon Fire TV Stick.PROS:Set up was easy. The variety of apps to choose from are great. AMAZING screensaver display! Nice game apps! Microphone voice command  great addition.CONS:When you use the microphone voice command it takes you out of whatever app you were in. You can't search anything within the app with the microphone. For some reason, certain cable TV apps won't let you sign in with your cable TV account..  It doesn't have Crunchyroll. I believe that maybe a licensing or competitor issues.I enjoy the stick but I would love to upgrade to the amazon fire TV box. I heard it had more features."
"592","My parents had the Fire TV and we had a chance to play with that over the holidays.  We really like the features that our older generation Apple TV was missing.  We liked being able to see what was available across all apps without having to dig into each one.  Being able to talk to navigate is pretty cool as well.  One of the big selling points was being able to use Prime video, which is not an app available on the Apple TV.  We thought about upgrading to a new generation Apple TV, which has all these features except access to Amazon Prime video but the price of the Fire Stick was too reasonable to spend the extra money.  Now we have all the features we want spread across two platforms.  Not perfect but we'll take it."
"593","I love the fire stick. This is my second one and I use it more than my TV. Only problem I have is getting a good app to link iPhone to fire stick.  Every time I try to download an app that says it is for iPhone or iPad, I get this message ""oops this is for android device only"" I would really like to mirror my photos and other screens online to my tv but can't seem to figure out how. Other than that I love the fire stick."
"594","First off this is a must have if you have a prime membership to truly get the most out of it. I love the wide range of apps that are supported by it. Especially Spotify, Youtube, Sling and PS Vue. However this remote does not have a volume control on it which means you need at least two remotes for audio control between apps. The picture quality and user experience is excellent! If you are considering this against other streaming dongles such as a chrome cast. This is a clear winner for me."
"595","Got this for my wife to hook up to our second floor bedroom TV.  I had an earlier version that would buffer all the time but decided to try this newer model.  Plugged it in, did the minor setup and was done.  No complaints from my wife and no buffering.  Netflix works well too."
"596","If you do not have a Smart TV, I highly recommend this for anyone who has high bills with their current service. If you are an Amazon Prime customer, this is a MUST have! I could not believe all that I had waiting for me for free. Easy to hook up. And you can never go wrong with Alexa!! Enjoy!"
"597","Works really well with only one small gripe about the design. The USB power cable port is on the side, which interferes with other items next to it. It would be better on the end like the Chromecast. Would definitely recommend this as really useful when travelling and staying at hotels. When I do this I also take a mini wifi router to create my own network using their LAN port since often hotels will block videos streaming devices and this gets around that."
"598","I should be amazed at this kind of technology but it has become somewhat commonplace.  The device works flawlessly including the voice remote.  The voice remote recognizes everything I say and, so far, has been able to find everything I have requested.  Although the technology behind the scenes is complicated, it is very simple to use for the end user.  I un-boxed the device, plugged into the HDMI port on my TV, answered a few simple questions about my network and was immediately up and running.  I am a Prime member so it already had my account information programmed in and I didn't have to bother setting that up.  I would say it took me less than 10 minutes from receiving the box until I had a movie playing on my TV."
"599","Netflix requires some special attention, and even then it's a minute or two before pictures become clear.  Are they trying to push people toward Amazon video??  Mirroring my phone to look at my photos could have been easier.  I was hoping fire would pair with Echo so I wouldn't have to use the remote and hold the button down to talk - that part is pretty much WWII technology.  Should be hands free through Echo.There are basically no instructions beyond plugging it in.  Using ""alexa"" in promotion and packaging of this product is just plain misleading.  I have alexa with my Echo, and this device has absolutely no hands free.  It's a wireless remote at a time when we are all tired of looking for the remote."
"600","Did not find it to be a logical device, it has a learning curve and entertainment devices should be able to be simple and sufficiently simplistic to be operated on the spot! (Turn On & be entertained instantly) Otherwise there is no pleasure in the entertainment it brings to you!"
"601","Love the fire stick Alexa with voice. Our old one crapped out and had no idea what we were missing out with the new one! The kids especially like to ask 'her' how to spell words ;)Would recommend! Haven't had any problems (only that we lose it at least 5 times a day haha)"
"602","I decided to cut the cord and purchased two Fire TV Sticks with Alexa.  Everything is right here - all my Amazon Prime content, Netflix, and numerous apps including a streaming service.  It was easy to set up and is easy to use, and I could not be more pleased.  Ad at a great price."
"603","I decided to stop going back and forth between DirecTV and Comcast because of costs. This device is the perfect solution if you want to cut the cord. I use Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV and Amazon Prime and I see all the shows I like for less than half of what my monthly DirecTV bill was."
"604","Great device. I have 2 versions of Chromecast and decided to replace them both with Fire TV Sticks mainly for the embedded software that makes using this much more convenient. If I find a way to share my laptop or phone screen on my Stick it will replace the Chromecast completely."
"605","The Fire TV Stick works great - extremely fast at accessing online service providers like Amazon Prime and Netflix.  Very nice menu system and the Alexa Voice Remote is very convenient and easy to use.  With just a little reading online you can also install new apps and add-ons."
"606","Just got it 2 days ago.  The remote is more tactile, which is much appreciated.  The software is much faster (thanks).  Suffering through much less buffering.  Haven't tried Alexa yet.  Have no great fondness for talking to my appliances.  Will re-rate if I ever give it a shot."
"607","I’m happy with this. I replaced my old Fire TV box with it. The old one was broken, which I wasn’t happy about, but this new setup seems to be just as fast and I believe the picture quality is better. I have no complaints. Easy setup too. I had it up and running in 10 minutes."
"608","So far so good.  I purchased this device to use to access Playstation Vue's Channel Package.  I have only used Alexa to call up some songs that are in Amazon Music, and that worked good.  I have this device now hooked up to my TV that is the furthest away from my WiFi signal with no streaming issues and I am running at about 40mbps.Doug"
"609","Love it! Love it! Love it!Using it almost every night to watch something new. Since we purchased Fire TV Stick, five of our friends have also purchased it based on our recommendation. I think we should get something back from Amazon because we are still advertising it!!!"
"610","Not quite sure, it doesn't seem to give me much more than I already have available. It seems if I try to watch certain things it wants me to subscribe for an amount. If I have to do that I should keep what I already have. Plus can not watch local channels for the news and weather. And I can't get my alexa voice remote to pair with my cable remote so I am just not sure if the prime membership is worth it. If I can't get these channels and new movies to watch. There is always a catch 22 and the reason I purchased the fire stick was to save on my cable subscription. As we are retired now and on a fixed income. And then again maybe I am not understanding every thing about the fire stick and the Amazon Prime subscription"
"611","I like the Fire stick but i keep thinking i would have liked the Roku stick better.  Since i am a prime member, i assumed all my apps would load on the stick and they don't because i was told that they aren't compatible with the stick...i find that to be crazy.  I downloaded the PBS app but can't watch passport items on the app on my tv thru the fire stick...there is no place to log in to the app or enter your passport code.  I am not too happy. Also Fire stick seems to lack alot of channels that Roku has.  Also the remote doesn't glow in the dark or have a back lite...that is something you guys need to work on. I love Amazon products but this is one that needs alot of improvement. I have considered sending it back!"
"612","Don't Waste Your Money or Time with Roku. I have both the latest Roku and the latest Fire Stick.  No comparison in performance, ease of use, footprint - or anything else.  Fire Stick wins the contest hands down.  Installed it on our main LCD and demoted Roku to the guest room."
"613","Received the unit last Friday and everything works fine except for the 5GH band. I contacted technical support both by email and on the phone. No solution to the problem so they send me another one, the same problem- no 5GH even though it shows on my other devices. Using Verizon Fios 1750ac router if that matters."
"614","its great but the remote doesn't work at all returned one to see if I was just the first one but the second one had the same problem had to down load the remote app on my phone to get it to work also I'm using my OUYA controller for games and have to guess which button does what wish I could edit that in the settings. also when will Alex be able to control the fire stick that needs to be added then ill add a star All that said the fire stick is great even with all these mistakes its easy to use once you get a working remote or the app for your phone. lots of fun apps and games its ok for now."
"615","Every account in one location for all of our viewing. I have my Prime, Netflix, Disney Movies Anywhere all logged in and there is still so much functionality I haven't played with yet. I have been using this for a couple weeks and I love it. I have had Google Chromecast since they came out, (actually have 3 of them in my house) but i can't believe I have gone this long without buying a Fire Stick."
"616","I've used it for a couple of weeks, on two different tv sets. One was a Vizio smart television that got dropped from the Amazon system. I used to just hook up the computer to a side HDMI, but that's so clunky. This is much easier. Of course, sometimes, for whatever reason, the fire stick is not available. Don't know why, but that's why it's not a five star review."
"617","Bought this for our bedroom which does not have cable. Love the Alexa remote! Our Echo Dot is in the living room, but I can use the remote to control the various lights in our house. At night I tell Alexa to turn on the bedroom lamp so I'm not walking into a dark room, then once in bed, I use the remote to turn off the light. This is not our first Fire Stick, but the first one I've used with the Dot and I love it!"
"618","Video quality is great with Amazon content.  But, if you're a fan of Netflix, You tube,  Or other content providers. I recommend Chromecast($35.) For some reason the firetvstick shows Netflix, and YouTube(that's all I've tested) streaming with lesser quality. Idk, maybe it's done on purpose."
"619","I was very cautious in letting go of my years-long account with DirectTV ... so cautious in fact that I kept the satellite for one month while I got to know the Fire Stick abilities.  I have now cancelled my DirectTV.  The stick works great!!!  I do not have internet as I live in the country so I use my data plan (hot spot) and have not regretted this at all.  I have not used a comparable item so I cannot tell you this is ""better than"" what others are out there, but I am quite satisfied with this purchase.  There is a good chance4 I will be purchasing another for TV's in the guest rooms!"
"620","Alexa on here works perfectly. RARELY ever misunderstands. FAR FAR better than our Roku 3. MUCH more clear picture than with the ROKU. All around a great experience. I needed one with an ethernet hookup, so I got the Fire TV and put this one another TV.Highly recommend."
"621","Plugs into available HDMI port, TV detects unit, flawless install within minutes, watching YouTube, Netflix, etc.  No detectable issues using WiFi, streaming is quick.  Alexa voice control remote is a plus to the easy remote buttons.  Easy learning curve.  Highly recommended."
"622","I have Fire TV Box on the main TV and bought Fire Sticks for the bedroom TVs.  I love that you just sign on with your main account and the stick is set up EXACTLY the same.  And using PS Vue, It's like having a Directv Genie but better because you can DVR all the shows you want and watch them on any tv.  And I'm saving over $100 a month!  Best choice I ever made."
"623","I'll admit that I bought the Fire TV Stick because I wanted to binge-watch ""Poldark,"" and had gotten tired of watching Amazon Prime on my phone.  However, I'm totally hooked now, and not just on ""Poldark.""  The kids enjoy asking Alexa for help with their homework (although Alexa isn't usually very helpful), and I like all of the choices available--including Netflix and Hulu."
"624","Flawlessly easy to connect and set up.  That was, unfortunately, the ""easy part"".  The ""hard part"" is the user interface: it is unbelievably non-intuitive (I suspect the interface design team skipped over a ""user assessment"" process in order to meet a market deadline).  The ""voice response"" system is a mixture of good and bad.  The good: one can get a weather forecast (with superb voice over) just by holding the button and asking.  The bad: using the voice recognition to ""rewind 30 seconds"" or ""pause now"" results is a frustratingly repetitive ""don't understand"" error.  I regret not having done some serious comparison research before spending the money on this Amazon product."
"625","This is a fantastic device.  I watch tv more with this than with regular tv (antenna).  We stopped using cable tv over a year ago and before this were using an antenna to get local channels, this helped to save money on not having cable anymore.  The problem with an antenna however sometimes you lose reception for whatever reason.  The fire stick has been great because we can watch practically anything we want. Movies, tv shows, etc.  The key is the Prime membership. You pay one membership annually and you can see all the Amazon movies, shows they produce.  There are some channels that cost separately if they are not part of your tv provider, but there is so much you can watch or listen to that it doesn't matter."
"626","This is my first negative review of an Amazon product. Perhaps I will update if and when I can get batteries in without cracking the case.UPDATE: After finding a video on opening the remote on YouTube, I was able to get the batteries in.  It's definitely a design flaw that Amazon should fix, but I am very happy with the Firestick itself, so I've increased the rating fro 1 to 3 stars.  Fix the remote and it's worthy of 5 stars.,"
"627","The set up is a breeze. It takes under 5 minutes from package to viewing. It works better than my smart TV on a low to medium wifi signal...it just streams better for some reason. Has all of the apps that I need. I take it to work with me often. And the Alexa feature is really nice. I'm such a huge fan!"
"628","we thoroughly enjoy the benefits of the fire stick.  This was a second one purchased for a second tv.  guess we're just spoiled!"
"629","I have a Western Digital Streaming player and it freeze so much and slow in comparison.  Playing Netflix was a hell after watching sometime due some memory performance degradation (as the player system show on screen), but with the Amazon Fire TV Stick is a bliss.Installation of Apps was fast and easy.  There is plenty of free games and applications.  i installed most of the network channels applications like Disney XD, ABC and NBC so no excuse to miss my favorites series episodes if i can't watch them the day is aired.  The setup of the stick and wifi was easy to connfigure.  The thing i did not like is that i cannot remove tiles and stuff i don't use at the moment, i wish for a clearer Home screen."
"630","The Fire devices are all perfect. I use the Firebox in the TV room, and use the Firestick in the bedroom. And as it’s just an android device, they are completely hackable too. Mind you, this is a very very good Android device that works perfectly and never glitches or fails."
"631","It takes some getting used to as the Alexa voice command doesn't do what I expect it to, insisting on having its own methods. But the reception, ease of installation, price and features are unbeatable! I highly recommend it, especially as the remote is so slim. Great design!"
"632","Unable to cast from your computer to your TV even though the TV has the Stick on it.  That's a massive turnoff and would definitely be more competitive with AppleTV if that were allowed.It seems super confusing to use this product.  So far, it seems mostly like an advertising venture for other products like Hulu, Netflix, and the individual channels such as HBO, Starz, etc. I bought a Prime subscription for one reason- take advantage of what it offers.  It would be nicer if they had a section for just Prime offers rather than find something I like only to see that it requires payment or another subscription."
"633","Bought this thing, it sat on my desk for 2 months before I took it out of the box.  I was in no rush as we turned off cable TV years ago and watch TV on the PC via internet.  The shows available are fantastic.  At first I was reluctant to sign up for Amazon Prime, but after 3 days, its well worth it.  Plus tinkering around today noticed on the available APPs to download can watch TV from another country, as my wife is from Thailand she was ecstatic, so apparently she thinks it was worth it.  Unfortunately it wont be down in  my man cave unless I let her keep this one and buy another.  I strongly recommend the fire stick"
"634","Works as expected, a bit weird search mode, however that is usual on most platforms. When purchased, they advertised two month free trial for Showtime which I did not received, and when inquired all reps pretended they did not understand the question and the emails remained without response, They asked for more info from me, which I did not have. So, if they advertise this item with a special promotion, take a screen shot before purchase, just in case.,"
"635","Quite happy with my Fire TV stick as we wean ourselves from the octopus like tentales of our cable company. No more exorbitant monthly cable fees to be extracted from our financial institution which we are extremely ecstatic to report. Lots of apps for the Amazon Fire TV stick to choose from for entertainment. Got the Fire TV stick as part of signing up with DirecTV Now which allows access to many more channels for viewing. Going to purchase another one so that multiple TV's in our home can also access video content without paying cable digital boxes. This is awesome as long as you have steady WiFI throughout your home and a modern TV with HDMI inputs which is pretty much standard nowadays. Highly recommend it."
"636","Being able to watch YouTube on my TV makes this product spectacular.  Just don't agree to the abusively intrusive Google terms in order to access your YouTube channel, without reading & considering it carefully.  It's a little awkward switching back & forth between cable & the Fire Stick but you get used to it.  Be careful with the Prime Photos in case there are any you don't want others to see.  There are parental controls, but it was a bit of a shock when I unexpectedly saw all my photos on TV.  This really makes a Prime membership worth the money.  Got to watch 6 seasons of Game Of Thrones in a week with a 30 day HBO Now free trial, which I will likely keep for a while.  You can't go wrong with this.  Enjoy!"
"637","There's not 8G on my fire stick, and yes I do have the Alexa voice stick. I just realized that it didn't have 8G after checking the fire tv box I just ordered. I hope Amazon doesn't pull that crap with the box because I will send it back. I am disappointed with Amazon because I never have a problem with orders not being what was advertised."
"638","I had to purchase this Fire Stick in order for my Amazon Prime to work on my 2011 Samsung.  Apparently, this particular year was not compatible.  They did knock off some of the purchase price and since I've received it it has worked very well.  Watching the Bosch series and am hooked."
"639","This new version is much better than the first generation, the connection seems to be much stronger I purchased two of these for each of my kids rooms. We've had them for a few months now and they work great, I haven't found any issues with them at all. They work just as they are supposed to. We are in a three level townhouse and my wifi router is down in the basement, bedrooms are up on the third floor. I do have a really good strong router though that I purchased from Best Buy, so I am sure that definitely helps avoid the freezing and other issues that I've seen others comment on. I would definitely recommend these to anyone, I was able to cut my cable bill and replace it with Netflix, Playstation Vue and Kodi."
"640","This device is very good at what it does. After getting it and setting it up, I came to the realization that my 2016 Samsung 4K UHD TV does the exact same thing that the Fire TV Stick does. If you want to cut the cable/satellite bill out you can get an attic mount HDTV antenna to get your local channels and along with the Fire TV Stick you're all set! I think that eventually I will pass it on to my daughter if she doesn't get herself a Samsung like me."
"641","So far, so good.  I still don't have the hang of using it and could stand a few more instructions. However, I've watched four episodes of Bosch and that's something I've wanted to see for a long while since I've read all the Michael Connelly books.  I'm enjoying the series."
"642","Recently owning both Fire TV stick and Roku 3600R streaming stick. I like both of them since I'm a prime member for the Fire stick. Although Fire TV stick doesn't let you install VUDU app to watch your digital movies. Also, make note this stick doesn't power via USB on your tv if you have a .5 amp, you'll get an insufficient power but that's not a biggie since you can supply power through a wall outlet. The Roku however, allow VUDU app and I used it in the bedroom together with this model private listening feature through their Roku app. You can attach a wired headphones or via Bluetooth-connected headphones on your mobile phone. Both are great if you have a Sling TV subscription for those favorite channels."
"643","The fire stick is okay...do not like the fact that I cannot transfer over to a tv station without unplugging the unit.  I have a $29 roku on another tv and find it works much better...I can go from roku to a tv station without having to uplug the roku.  Much more convenient"
"644","What can I say, pretty much everyone has covered just about everything inconceivable about the fire stick up to this point.Only thing I like to add is the improvement on the remote opening case. The previous remote, somewhat resembling Gort, was pain in the you know what to open. The other gripe I have is the lack of Starz and Encore app in this latest fire stick.  Funny thing is I am having the opposite problem others are experiencing. I am getting the subscription/trial period and not the cable app. I have tried the firmware upgrade, checked my regional setting, searched for the app, went to the cable app feature without success. I did report to the tech department and confirmed it. On second thought, maybe I received a lemon?"
"645","I bought one of these to try out. I subscribed to PlayStation vue and sling. I am very happy with the service. I think some people may have internet issues and blame it on the stick. I have 150 mbps service and it works great. I ended up cutting my direct tv off and buying two more fire sticks."
"646","Worked out of the box, simple setup, would recommend to everyone who do not use Sling TV.  It is not the products fault, I have problems with Sling TV on all devices I try to watch on.  Fire TV is a great product, the 4 stars is not their fault. I would recommend it to all."
"647","I hope this is the right place to put this information, I have noticed 2 Issues:1.) If for whatever reason you have to reset the fire stick to defaults, one of the first things you must do is pair the little black remote, well to put it simply, it takes a very very very….. you get the idea, long time, I’m not quite sure what is happening but have tried this procedure on two separate devices.2.) It would be really nice if after completing step 1, you could setup up your little blue-tooth keyboard if you have one like me, that way you don’t have to keep pushing up up up up, down down, left left…. Again I think you get the idea, to enter all these characters that are needed to finish the setup."
"648","We are transitioning away from using a dish for TV due to the every rising costs. We love this with the services it provides and the apps to install the networks we actually watch at much lower costs to us. Set up was simple to do and it has worked flawlessly over our internet service from the beginning."
"649","It works wonderfully.  I was using my blueray player to watch netflix but it was buffering most of the time.  I ended up watching it in my tablet. But with the fire stick i was able yo watch it thru the tv with no problem. It turned my tv into a smart tv so that was awesome."
"650","The Fire Stick is easy to use and streams quickly.  Good product but could be better if the remote had a volume control.  I have an Apple TV streaming device on the same tv with the Fire Stick.  I seldom use the Apple TV.  The Fire Stick has more apps available that I want than the Apple but both are good products."
"651","The only reason I cannot give this 5 stars is I have not used all the options available.  Being summer time I am not watching much TV.  However, The music stations are fantastic.  The only problem I'm having is I cannot get it to play the music stations on my outside speakers, which are attached to a different tuner than the TV, surround sound I have that is 8 years old.  Seems to offer lots of movies and other tv programs at no charge."
"652","I've been using Roku 3 for about a year and a half and decided to try the fire stick. And so I left the Roku 3 connected when I installed the fire stick to compare. I do like the user interface much better, but for some unknown reason the Roku is more responsive on some apps.I am a news person. I have noted that when I can't get a news app up on the Fire stick I can on Roku. Kind of silly, but consistently true for the last month."
"653","The Fire Stick is only saved by Kodi. If it weren't for Kodi this device would be useless. Most App no longer work especially if you have Charter cable. Apps like HBO go Showtime anytime and spectrum app along with many more apps. Can't play youtube purchases or Google play purchases on the YouTube app either. Still has too many ads and don't get me started with Alexa. ""Sorry I can't access that skill right now"" "" Sorry I don't know the answer to that question "" it's very frustrating and not helpful at all. There are very few apps I can use now. Unless you run Kodi then it's not worth having. The Roku is a much better device with many more apps to choose from."
"654","I love this device. I can get everything on it and have never had an issue with it at all. Only one issue, wondering if there is a way to use this remote or if it is compatible to use on my Amazon fire tv as the remote for that has stopped working. Other than that no actual issue with the device or remote control. Thank you Amazon. I am proud to have been a long time customer shopping with your website for over 10 years..."
"655","Overall, it is a good product. The issues that I have with the Fire TV Stick come from the difficulty it has picking up my 5G wi-fi. I had to watch videos online to learn how to reconfigure the speed of my wi-fi and change the security settings so that the Fire Stick could pick up my 5G. Judging from the amount of articles there are online about this issue, this is a wide spread problem that should be recognized and addressed by Amazon. Another issue I have is with the search when looking for a particular movie, show, etc. Often times instead of directing me to the apps I already have that have the content it directs me to the pay Amazon option."
"656","Should have gone with the fire tv. I like all the features of the fire stick except there is no optical output for speakers. I have an LG sound bar that only has optical connections, and my tv doesn't have any. So my options were use the crummy tv sound or blue tooth sound to my sound bar. I used the Bluetooth option which worked, but after 15 minutes or so there because a delay and the sound and mouth movements don't match up. I've tried playing with the setting on my speaker but that doesn't work. Only solution is to pause a few seconds then hit play and it goes back to normal. It's annoying but I'm dealing with it"
"657","Bought this for my dad and set it up for him.  The voice command ability was nice...to be able to switch between apps without going back to the home screen.It also seemed convenient to be able to search for movies in the home screen and have it tell you which app has the movie available."
"658","The Fire Stick is Awesome!!! I bought a 55"" Smart TV on Black Friday to replace my 40"" HDTV in my living room and move it to my bedroom. I bought the Fire Stick, so I could watch Netflix and Prime in my bedroom. It does not disappoint, everything the commercial says and then some. Luckily I have a PS4 in my living room, because I can't get the Amazon or HBO apps on my smart tv. This Stick is sweet! You can get every streaming app installed on it, and Alexia is really cool. I can push the button and ask to play music, what the weather is like, to find programs and shows to watch without hassle of turning on a light to see what buttons to push from the comfort of my bed. I highly recommend getting one."
"659","I LOVE MY FIRE TV STICK!!!! I decided to cut the cable cord, as the price was just increasing rapidly, and really without much, nor many changes in offerings. (They had the 30-40(ish) stations, then the exact same stations repeated,only in HD, and the sports channels, (where I spent most of my time!) GO NINERS!!) ;) Then they added some retro-stations. But again, nothing to write home about, and my bill went from $56.-$85-$110.15 in less than 3 years...SOOOO, A BUE BYE cable! And as I have a wireless TV, I didn't need the box that is offered.And the remote is voice activated, so you can say"" comedies"" etc. and a short list of the different type are displayed. (PLUS, there is NO monthly fee for using the stick! Only the one time purchase price, which is incredibly reasonable.) I installed the Fire Stick, and was quite amazed by all that was offered. ( I also have Amazon Prime,which is not needed to to receive stations, you can pick and choose to suit your needs and no forced stations to watch as cable has!) which also rocks, and they offer so much to pick and choose from, I love that feature. And the picture quality is superb. HD all the way! It also offers many different apps, ie"" HBO NOW in which if you have Prime, they offer a 30 day free trial! And HULU Plus,(another 30 day free trial!) Also many of the stations offered by cable, as well as stations for kids, and the basic 3 major networks:ABC/NBC/CBS PLus the sports versions of these stations.  And their Prime music has EVERYTHING, every genre as well. (And as one in ""the music biz,"") I was thrilled by this. So gang, if you are considering cutting your cable cord, and saving the big bucks, this Fire TV Stick is the way to go!!!! I kid you not!! And if you are a sports spaz like myself, there is a station called ""Sling TV,"" that has ALLLLL of the sports stations, PLUS The NFL Network!! Along with the regular stations that are not sports related!! HUGE~HUGE PLUS! It  has 2 ways to watch, there is an ""Orange package that has many stations, plus some sports, and The Blue, that has more, plus more sports. I chose BOTH, The orange and Blue. And together it is only #39.98 a month! (Including The NFL Network!) So you can't beat that with a stick!! Lol....So, please consider this wonderful offering from Amazon. It is SO worth it! I simply cannot say enough good things about this. (Without rambling on more than I have already!) And if you do decide that this isn't for you, (which I honestly do not see happening!) Amazon's Customer Service Representatives are superb, so kind and helpful, no rush, no judgement, just great folks. So, I encourage you to give it a try, I'm sure you will NOT be disappointed. And I am a skeptic!"
"660","I use this for travel, and it works nicely, I highly recommend the Hermitshell Hard EVA case for Amazon Fire Stick which holds it well.  Only complaint is that I had not realized that the fire stick needs to be plugged in to function, I had thought there would be a battery that wouldn't require this.  That can be a challenge in some hotel rooms."
"661","Can't believe how easy it is to operate!  My USB port needed the adapter to fit...which was included. This senior citizen was initially a little intimidated as I opened the box knowing I had to get behind the tv, , but was pretty impressed that it works just as advertised.  We have Xfinity... and all I can say is they could learn a lot from the easy to use Firestick and iintuitive interface.  Call me very happy!"
"662","This thing is just great!  It was easy to set up and simple to use.  I replaced this 'alexa' version from an older 'fire Stick' that had gone bad.  Prime was a problem this time, though.  I did not get the item in 2 days, but 5 days and it was not in a Prime package."
"663","Easy! We just plugged it in, downloaded the app we wanted, and off we went! At $40 one time only, it's great for streaming free stuff and services you already have. If you have Amazon Prime, it's even better. The voice control works pretty well, too, all things considered."
"664","I really love playing around on the fire stick. The apps are fun to work with. I do get confused at times and wish that it came with instructions or maybe have an explanation section. There are so many different channels and I can just ask Alexa for my music....loving it!!"
"665","The only issue I had with the remote is,  it was a bit difficult to open even with the instructions on the plastic that it was in.  After the difficult opening, it is very easy to use. The on screen assistance was good to follow. Fits just right in hand.  I will recommend."
"666","Easy set up and tons of free movies. Not new releases.  But it's good to have when you can't find anything to watch on TV.  Also easy to rent or buy the new movies.  This is a must have for people that like to kick back and watch a movie.  Would recommend to everyone."
"667","I like it, it fits for the purpose. Just that I thought that the microphone remote control was going to be useful not only to control even when using the apps, for example within Youtube I still have to type manually what I want to search for, microphone does not work to search within the app."
"668","Easy to set up and use.  Many shows and movies with a slight fee for more recent movies.  Watch programs on YouTube. Have not explored all the capabilities but it meets my expectations.Alexa is a good feature but it doesn't always understand at first try."
"669","The product was super easy to hook up and use. I would add the voice activated control was a bit hard to use just because it seemed to want certain words and phrases to accurately find what was requested. I find I unfortunately then avoid using the voice control and just scroll with remote, but, otherwise it is perfect and I would recommend this product to my friends."
"670","I also have an Apple TV. I prefer Apple TV's layout (cleaner appearance, easier to navigate), however the fire stick was much cheaper, and works just as well (seamless movement of the cursor, quick, connects well to my WiFi and streams videos smoothly). I would buy this again if I ever needed a second. The voice controlled remote is a really nice feature (the ""jump ahead ___ minutes"" is really a time saver- doing it manually on any device is always a pain!)."
"671","I bought the fire TV in December 2015 and had to have it replaced in February because it quit working.  In December 2016, the remote wouldn't work.  Amazon was helpful and offered to replace the voice remote.  Since it was out of stock, they gave me a credit and I purchased the Fire Stick in order to get the new remote.  The new remote wouldn't work either so we replaced the Fire box with the Fire Stick.  It worked well for 2 weeks and the remote stopped working again.  Thankfully this time we downloaded the app onto my phone so we can use the stick, but it's not as convenient as the remote.  I LOVE the Fire products when they are working but Amazon definitely has some bugs to work out in their technology."
"672","My Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice control is awesone. I don't have to search all over the place to gind something to watch. I really enjoy Alexa over the regular Amazon Fire Sick. I just say what I want and poof, there it is. No more frustration looking for something to watch. This is heaven"
"673","Now this is cool. I dropped all my cable TV when the price crept northward of $200 a month...no one need TV at that price....and spent a very long time watching Amazon Prime on my computer. While I love my computer for many things, watching TV shows turns out not to be one of them. I toyed with streaming options but never really jumped until the Fire Stick was announced. I figured for the price it was worth the risk. Combined with an over-the-air digital antenna I now have plenty of options. The installation was a piece of cake. My wireless router is on the second floor and the reception downstairs has been trouble-free. I can't comment on the voice remote as I will not use it but the performance is excellent. Highly recommended."
"674","I saw the commercial on T.V. on how to dump cable and go streaming. I had  one T.V. hooked up to antenna so we hooked up the other 3 and ordered one FIRE T.V. Got here in two days, hooked it up and got a streaming company. Already had Amazon Prime and with the local channels on antenna have everything my wife and I need. So we ordered two more FIRE T.V. Sticks for a total of three and they can all be on at the same time with no trouble. Saving $85.00 a month and have everything we need. After football season we can switch levels of streaming (BIG TEN CHANNEL)  if we want to and save $95.00. Its not about saving money, its about not being screwed. My internet company I'll always have so its free for streaming."
"675","I love this so much I bought two. I am coming from using a Roku box and Roku stick, the Fire Stick is so much better for a couple of reasons. First, the Fire Stick is much faster, moving from app to app is quick, and there is very little buffering when watching movies or TV shows. The second reason is the ability to side load apps, Kodi being the one most everyone seems to get. Once you get Kodi and the add ons that are available, the Fire Stick gives you virtually unlimited viewing options. I have always been able to find what I am looking for.I can't recommend high enough the Amazon Fire Stick, I may pick up the Fire Box sometime in the near future, just to see if it is better than the Fire Stick."
"676","Simple, inexpensive, have one on all my TV's.Would like to see the search function pull results across all apps like Roku does.As it is now, search results focus on Amazon Prime Video only. E.g. search for ABC movie on Roku and it'll tell you it's available on Hulu, Netflix, etc., whereas voice search on the Firestick will only display purchase options on Amazon.That aside, for $39 it's phenominal. Stand out feature is Bluetooth audio capability, which I use at night w/ headphones when everyone  is asleep, or you can output to a Bluetooth speaker if your display doesn't have built in audio.Great device overall with the exception of the aforementioned search."
"677","I would and I do recommend this to everyone. It's a little slower than Apple TV but it is much cheaper and provides the same functionality. Kodi is an option and you can stream your movies from your computer if you are tech savvy. Even then, you can use Hulu, Netflix, and anything else you can think of.My only downfall is the power cord and where you plug it into. That could have been thought up a little better. It's not cheaply made, but it's just positioned in a awkward spot and the cable tends to bend in a deep U shape. I would advise to make cable bendable towards the connection and move it close to the end, and possibly put a latch on it to lock it in place.All in all, GET IT!"
"678","Since I have used Amazon Fire Stick, I've only had 1 ten second buffering issue with my internet signal. I've been using my Amazon Fire stick for three weeks. I get lots of channels such as Hulu, Sling TV, NBC, ABC Now, Direct TV, HBO and more. It works better than the ROKU Streaming Stick."
"679","So far so good, bought it to replace a roku stick that was just too limited. Was able to add some apps to make viewing more enjoyable. Also convinced me to get Amazon prime to get the most out of it. Setup was easy, adding apps is easy, easy to navigate, no complaints what so ever. Actually, only minor negative thing is that it's recommended to be plugged into the wall and not the TV. I think it's odd but it worked out for me, just hate having one more cord dangling from the TV. Definitely recommend."
"680","I should have read a little more closely before ordering. I have hundreds of movies on Vudu and Up to now I have been unable to watch any of them because Amazon apparently does not have an application to run Vudu... and some other apps that are available on Roku. Live and learn. I would give it 5 stars if it was more versatile. I would give it only 3 stars due to my disappointment, but I guess it's not Amazon's fault that I didn't search more carefully."
"681","I had considered purchasing and second roku but decided to try this instead as they are comparable in price. I'm so glad I did! I love being able to ask questions such as ""What movies are playing in the local theater?"" or ""What is the weather like?"" Also I like being able to say, ""play (such and such song)"" or ""open (such and such show/movie) in Netflix"" instead of navigating manually (although navigation is pretty quick and simple too!)"
"682","Ordered the Fire TV Stick on a Sunday, received it on Thursday.. So easy to set up and I'm in my 70's !  I had a Spotify account, so all of my music and playlists transferred to the Spotify app, also, all cd's and music I had bought from Amazon in the past all transferred to my TV.. I love the Alexa Voice Remote.. She finds the apps I'm looking for, plays any music and artist I ask for.. I'm very pleased with my purchase.There's lots of movie and TV apps, but, you have to join and pay for a good number of them to be able to watch.  I already was a member of Netflix and I joined Amazon Prime. There's lots of good movies and series on A. P.  It's well worth the money, if you enjoy watching TV and movies.."
"683","Works great.....easy to install a and operate.  Portability makes it nice for taking on trips and overnight hotel stays."
"684","This is a great addition to our home entertainment and the addition of the Alexa control is fantastic. And I feel like Gary Busey."
"685","I love the fire stick but the remote quit working after only a month. I tried changing the batteries and I Googled on how to reset it maybe and tried different suggestions but nothing worked. However I am happy that there is a fire TV remote app in the app store on my phone which works better than the regular remote"
"686","I heard a lot about the Fire Stick so I decided to by one. The newest version comes with an Alexa enabled remote that works very well. Setup was fast and easy. I now have quick boice access to my Prime Music and Videos. I also downloaded the apps for Youtube snd Netflix."
"687","This has been hit or miss in our household.  Mainly due to our internet, which isn't the fastest in the world.  if you have great internet, this is a great deal.  If your internet is speed is a little slow, like ours, you can have some issues with freezing and buffering."
"688","Couldn't handle the jacking up price of my cable bill and there were shows that were repeat the next day. So to cut the cost I decided to by the fire stick and now I love it! Have it connected to TV in the living room and will be ordering another for my bedroom instead of trying to move it around the house. Have a 1yr old who loves watching Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and I can let her watch it when I'm cooking to keep her occupied instead of being my shadow. And my husband can watch his sports channels."
"689","This is a great deal for Prime members.  Easy to install except getting the remote open to install the batteries.  After straining my fingers for so long I went to You Tube and found out how to open it.  I never realized how many movies and tv shows were on Amazon Prime!"
"690","Bought this to stream onto our TV without cable.Allows us to watch many shows & movies.Recently started X files, as we've never watched it start to finish. Small, easy to set up, efficient for people who don't watch TV often enough to purchase expensive cable plans."
"691","This is the best stick so far,but things will never chage.Why make any amazon tv gadget useless? They make it 8 gigs and the operating system and obligatory apps take half of it, they put portable storage compatibility but you can install apps there, just make an at least 16 gigs gatget once and for all!. A gigabyte of memory is just probably a few cents now.If we had the memory capacity we could probably use more of the amazon music,photo and kindle,but they are shooting themselves in the foot by making a superb gadget that is useless because of lack of memory."
"692","We LOVE it. We were looking for a way to get away from cable and the Firs Stick has made that possible. However, we were disappointed to find that there is now a bundle (inc: the Fire Stisk and an HD antennae) that we could have gotten. I guess we were a little to quick on the purchase.Anyway, we are totally pleased!!!"
"693","i have been using streaming devices for more than four years.  i just got my firestick set up last night and so far so good.  i know many others who have purchased it and love it.  i'm glad i finally purchased it (my ouya was out of date and in need of replacement) and yeah, i would gladly recommend it.  i love not being 'owned' by cable companies.  i've been done with that racket for more than four yrs and couldn't be happier."
"694","I don't have a huge lexicon of devices to compare to, but it's been snappy and easy to use -- much faster than the home blue ray or smart TV tech -- and faster than the Gen One Chromecast.  I can safely recommend.  The Alexa feature, in its current form, is only so useful.  It won't search anywhere but Amazon's content.  So you can't voice search Netflix.  You can only ask it to launch Netflix, then you have to search manually.  But, again, it's pretty responsive, so not that big a deal.Overall, I think it's worth the money.  I've not tried to play games on it, but it works fine for streaming.  The voice search feature has some maturing to do yet.All and all, I'd purchase again."
"695","Really enjoy my Fire Stick!  I just received it last week! It was very easy to setup and came packaged very well!  I am pleased with it and recommend it to others!"
"696","Waiting for a call back from amazon to see if they get my fire stick working. It won’t turn on. They said if they can’t change the resolution from wherever they are I will have to replace it. Bought it on June 22nd and Nov 1 it stops working!  39 days out of warranty. IF I buy another I will buy the extended warranty. IF I BUY ANOTHER!  Ok it had to be replaced but I will get another. The reason behind this is. 1 I love the fire stick and 2 I always get the best customer service from Amazon always."
"697","This is my 2nd Fire TV Stick with voice remote (sadly, accidentally broke our first one beyond repair). I thought I'd hold off on ordering a new one but it just went on sale and we miss having it for one of our TVs with no cable access. Love that we can move it to whichever TV, voice search is a fantastic feature, and it's easy to access everything!"
"698","I only wish I had known about the Fire Stick sooner. I have canceled all movie cable movie channels because now I can watch any movie I want with the Fire Stick. I'm still learning all the wonderful things I can watch for free. I highly recommend this product to everyone!!!"
"699","Love the fire stick! Got it on sale for $30 but it's well worth the $40 usual price!WiFi reception is great. Some apps are slow but I think it's the apps because HBO go streams HD just fine. Netflix and Hulu work well too. Comedy Central and some of the cable channels are slow but there isn't much content there anyway.Remote works very well too, the fire stick picks it up at almost angle angle unlike some that have to be pointed directly at the unit.I haven't even had the stick long enough to explore its full capabilities like playing files I have in the cloud, but we use this thing every5night for 4-6 hours and longer on weekends. How could that not be worth the money?"
"700","Very nice, easy to use and very portable. Also since it can be linked to other Amazon devices is a big plus. The only thing that does not let me give this a five star is the difficulty to add apps that are not already offered on the fire stick. Otherwise a great device."
"701","I love the Firestick. Besides all the choices of free movies, TV, educational programs for my kids and documentaries it also streams MUCH better than my DVD player.Only complaint is that the remote OFTEN locks up necessitating removing and reinserting the battery."
"702","I've been using this product for about a week now. Insulation was really simple and took maybe 15 minutes from opening the package to sitting down and actually watching all my shows login to the respective apps on the device. I have been using Google Chromecast for years, and this product is only a little bit more and does so much more! The Voice remote is also super convenient and it is a lot more user-friendly than having to stream things off of your cell phone or tablet. We will be getting more of these for the rest of our televisions."
"703","We actually got out Fire Stick for free even we subscribed to DirecTV Now, and I had planned on using it on our guest room TV, because we already have a Roku for our main TV.Maybe I'm just spoiled by Roku, but I did t find the Fire Stick user experience at all enjoyable. I guess my biggest  complaint is something that would be expected: it's far too focused on content from Amazon Prime Video, at the expense of other providers. It was very jarring, after being used to the level playing field that Roku provides.Anyway, I gave it a try, but was really underwhelmed. It's kind of like comparing a Fire tablet to an iPad.I'm selling my Fire Stick and buying a used Roku 3 for the guest room."
"704","Great product, power port on fire stick needs to be moved or another added on the rear of item. Had to plug in fire stick to side HDMI port (since it won't fit behind the TV due to limited space), and with the power plug on top, eventually the power cord will wear out due to gravity taking over."
"705","Kinda slow, buffers some, I have 150 MBPS (supposedly). I've already put a 3rd set of batteries in the remote. The thing will go dark or freeze up altogether,  and have to be rebooted by cutting off the power. I ended up hard wiring it to the router via an adapter. The video quality is great however."
"706","There are so many great reviews about the Fire Stick here already and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time repeating all that, so I’ll just skip to a few things I thought were really cool.  First, it’s about forty-bucks, which really is a bargain is considering all the channels and apps that are available.My flat screen speakers are not the greatest, so I plugged my Fire Stick HDMI cable into HDMI port 1 and set my flat screen remote to HDMI 1.  Now I get everything in stereo and surround!  It’s very easy to setup.  Just find your router name and type in the password and you’re set to go!What’s cool that I have NOT seen printed anywhere is the options you have with Alexa.  Sure you can ask any questions about anything and get some great answers.  However, when you are watching a movie, have you ever wondered who that actor is?  Or what the character’s name is?  Or what is that song playing in the background?  With the remote you can pause the movie and it will actually show a photograph of the actor, their real name, their character’s name and all the other actors in that scene.  Even better, if there is a great song playing in the film, it will show you the song artist and song title!I hope that helps convince someone that this is a very cool invention with so many extras and options that it is virtually endless.  When I find out more obscure great stuff, I will update this.  The Fire Stick is awesome!"
"707","I purchased the fire Fire Stick at the beginning of January and had to wait until the depleted stock became available.  Once I finally received it I installed it, which took less than five minutes, and I immediately became hooked.  There are plenty of apps to choose from as well as Amazon exclusive movies and series.  I have not watched ""regular TV"" for two days.Installation was extremely easy.  Just plug into wall, plug into HDMI port on TV and follow the instructions. My Fire Stick came pre registered to my Amazon account and as a Prime subscriber I am immediately able to watch thousands of shows, including previously rented/purchased  DVD.  With this feature alone will Fire Stick will pay for itself within one year.  Only regret is that I did not use this Prime service previously.Installing Kodi and Exodus was extremely easy.  Just look the installation up in You Tube.Bottom line, if you enjoy watching TV or movies you have to get an Amazon Fire Stick; you will not regret it.  So impressed that I purchased a second one for the 52"" LCD in the family room.  Programs and movies look theatre like."
"708","So far.....Great!  I am totally new to this kind of TV watching.  I like the fact that I can take from house to house as I dog sit and this makes it very convenient.  I have not tried out the Alexa Voice Remote as of this writing, but plan on soon to discover this feature.  So far....so good!"
"709","I love it!  Someone had asked me if the fire stick would work with the Scepter TV I bought last Nov.  At the time I had no idea what they were talking about!  So I asked someone else about it who did research on YouTube.  It wasn't expensive and I love the movies, music from my Cloud Library.  Such a variety of movies.  I needed to buy an extender to reach our wifi source & that wasn't expensive either.  I'm still exploring the possibilities with the Fire Stick!"
"710","I loved the fire stick what a great investment.Will recommend it to buy very easy to installed, I used U-Tube for help"
"711","I have the chromecast stick and Roku 3 at my home.  The Fire TV stick remote took some time getting used to at first.  But after months of usage, the Fire TV stick is actually my favorite streaming device.  It had several Apps that allowed me to easy watch Netflix, Watch ESPN, and several others.  It also has the ability to load other android Apps, such as ES Explorer that allows me to connect to my file server at the house.  I have not used the voice remote that often, so I cannot comment.  The only comment I will make with that is that it works better than the voice search on the Roku.  Every time I used the Roku voice remote, it crashes Roku.  The Roku device has the latest software, so that's not the issue."
"712","I absolutely love the Amazon Firestick. I purchased this to stream beachbody on demand workout videos. Just add the beachbody app to your device and it will appear on your TV under the apps category. It was very easy to set up. You can also unplug it from your TV and use it on any other TV with a USB port. There's a wide variety of entertainment to watch with the Firestick. I'm very happy with this purchase."
"713","It's almost to good to be true.  I ordered the Fire TV stick and cancelled cable.  I'm not a big tv watcher so it was long overdue.  It's going to save me $100 a month.  I'm kicking myself for not doing it a year ago.  There are so many things I could have used that extra $1200 for.  Well at least I'm doing it now.  I highly recommend this product.  I even bought one for my mom...now if I can only convince her to cancel cable too....wish me luck."
"714","Ordered this device, plugged into the TV and it began working immediately.  Set up the WiFi and downloaded some channels.  Very easy to use and we are satisfied with the purchase.  I like the fact you can take it with you to other locations as long as there is a WiFi signal."
"715","So very happy with this purchase.  I had recently bought  the non-Alexa version and my husband liked it so mitch he asked me to order one for his TV so I did and now I am jealous! Hoping to secretly sneak into his man cave and switch them lol. We have had several roku models and I never had a complaint with them but I will say that after having the fire stick I find it to be much more use friendly and I love the quality. It is conveniently tucked away behind the TV. And let's face it...who wouldn't like being able to tell your TV to find what you're looking for? I would highly recommend this to friends and family and anyone looking for a smooth operating, sleek design, AND portable streaming device!"
"716","Would get five stars, except my wife thought that she could just watch the movie that says it is free with prime, so she watched it and Amazon instantly started a Prime membership on my account! And since she used a Prime benefit by watching the movie, I get no refund! Over a hundred dollars for one movie! We already had Prime Family with my daughter's account.The card works very well for sling, Kodi most apps, but you are tightly tied to Amazon's appstore. The sling app is buggy for the Firestick and freezes at the end of every sling commercial. Luckily, sling is working to correct it.I've now set up parental controls to keep her (or me) from buying anything else by mistake."
"717","I have had the Firestick for over two months ans a number of issues including Netflix error code -111 came up on the screen.  After talking to Netflex for over 40 mins they had no idea what was going on with the Firestick and told me it might be a bad Firestick.  After removing the app and reinstalling the Netflix app and resetting all the setting I was able to correct the issues with Netflix."
"718","GREAT tool! I've only had it about 4 days. It's awesome! Works great. My only, minor issue with it right now is that it buffers/streams slower than I thought it would with the Kodi app I'm using when it comes to shows on live tv channels. Movies stream like a charm, tv series on network channels works. Again, my only minor issue right now is the slow buffering/streaming of shows on live tv channels where sometimes the show comes to a halt and I have to restart it or find another link to the show."
"719","Got ride of my cable and bought fire stick for living room and bedroom TVs. Don't miss the cable at all. I receive the live news that I want and select the programs that I want to watch versus paying for 60 channels that I never watch. Plus, fire stick is reliable and very intuitive to use. LOVE IT!"
"720","Debated far too long to experience the wonderful media experience this device offers.  Couldn't be pleased more! I absolutely love gadgets and this lil thumb drive of a device has become my favorite! Looking forward to countless hours of enjoyment from the lil BIG guy."
"721","Love it! Does everything as advertised, we don't even have cable anymore.  Between this and Apple TV, we have no need for cable.  The only problem with this, is if you lose the remote... you basically pay the full price again for the remote alone.  So keep track of it and you're good to go!"
"722","Its pretty good with the right add ons and a good wifi connection. Otherwise its a lot of loading screens. You have to experiment with different add ons to see which ones have the content your looking for. But its an easy set up if you want to pay for your programming or just check out Kodi,Exodus add ons to get stuff for free. Its a bit of a process to load stuff into it but most of the videos I came across they walk you through it.Enjoy!"
"723","Allows for multitasking! Was previously having to connect my laptop via HDMI to my television to watch streaming video. Now I can watch streaming video AND use my laptop at the same time. The voice remote is icing on the cake!"
"724","I love my new fire stick. I can finally get Netflix on my Samsung smart tv! I'm still exploring all the options in between watching new shows and movies. Set-up was a tad frustrating until I realized I needed to use my remote whenever i need to use a keyboard or arrows."
"725","DOES WHAT IT SAYS. You can get all kinds of TV viewing with this device.  I just wish there were a better way to set things up other than dealing with the keyboard on the TV screen."
"726","I have only had this for a couple days now but so far I am loving it! It is super quick to change screens or load a show. Very intuitive and it is fun asking Alexa random questions. I like that you can play music through Pandora and Spotify too. It was also really easy to set up."
"727","We are very happy with our Fire TV Stick! It loads quickly and works very well with our TV and current internet connection/speed. We had used our BluRay player to stream video but, the Stick seems to perform much better. There was no way to add apps to the old player. Fire TV makes it simple to find and install additional apps. I have a few additional things to do (digital TV antenna & etc.) before I cut the cable completely. Fire TV has been a huge step in the right direction."
"728","I don't have cable so some thing is better than nothing, But because of me not having it I can't use a lot of the so called free apps. If you think you will get all these apps for free think again. Most apps you will want are pay apps or you need a subscription to cable, and in that case why have this. Don't get me wrong it works great and loads fast. There are even some free apps worth watching like the cw, but there are few, Also not all open apps including pay ones work for it like funamation. so check before you buy kind of a toss up between this and a Roku player. Although Roku dose allow you to use some different apps like hasbro studios. All and all it works well just not like advertised, not without help."
"729","Absolutely love itWe got rid of Direct TV and subscribed to Netflix and HuluMy TV and my DVD player were not being updated (software wise) anymore so I decided to try Firebrick first then got a second for the bedroom the kids love it I like it.. what else can I say best product for the buck and the programing is good too."
"730","Love this so much. We tried using Google Chromecast but we couldn't use our phone as a hot spot to get it to work, which was frustrating so we returned it. Fire allows us to do that, so right there was a plus. But it's so stinking easy to use - the setup is seamless, and it's very easy to navigate once you are in there. Alexa is just ok - she's fun to ask random things to and not get the real answers, haha. I think Alexa has a long way to go from just question and answer. But, we didn't buy this for Alexa, but rather streaming Netflix and Prime shows/movies for which is work perfectly. Highly recommend this."
"731","I was using an xbox for watching app based streaming, but my roommate broke that, so I went and bought a Roku Stick. The roku stick didn't work on anything (old and new tvs) so I ended up buying a roku box. I wanted to get my dad something similar and noticed that the Amazon Fire sticks were cheaper, so I got him this.It's waaaay better than Roku. With my Roku, I have to point the remote directly at the little box, you don't have to do that with the fire stick. The roku remote is light and feels cheap, the Fire Stick remote feels more durable and definitely looks more professional. I enjoyed my dad's gift more than my own roku, so I bought another stick for myself and gave my roku to a friend."
"732","I bought this second stick a few weeks ago and it seems to work better than the original.  Connectivity is great, better than the 1st, even though they're both on the same home network.  Only bummer is that I paid 10.00 more for my unit than the current 29.99 black Friday price."
"733","Still getting used to the features and a little confusing when you are already a Prime Customer on setting up your account, as it didn't automatically update.  It took a couple times restarting and working around the settings menu.  Also, you still we need your tv remote, as Fire TV Stick does not have functionality over volume.  All in all, I really like the Alexa flexibility and voice activated functions in getting around in my Prime Account."
"734","I've tried many other brands but the Amazon really came up with the best TV stick out there. However, I had high hope to sit and watch hours of tv, but instead I decided to have a baby, and I already had a toddler, so I haven't been able to watch any tv at all... but I'll keep my Fire stick... one day I'll be able to watch tv, shower for longer than 7.2 minutes, seat to eat, sleep, wear something other than yoga pants, and see my husband again."
"735","We have decided to cancel our cable and are so happy we bought the Fire Stick. We were so happy with the purchase we got them for our family for Christmas. I love that there is a lot of family friendly programming available for all of my kids. We have also really enjoyed the Amazon shows that are exclusive to Amazon."
"736","Can't believe I waited so long to get this! So so easy to install and use, gives us everything we want. Just buy one!!"
"737","This turns an ""old"" TV into a smart TV, between Amazon's own streaming other streaming apps available for download you don't need cable.My only suggestion / gripe would be that the remote doesn't have volume control still requiring you to use the TV remote. This is an easy fix for Amazon, simply add an up/down control on the remote and you can control the stick's audio output levels to the TV just like adjusting the volume on Youtube/Netflix in your computer browser versus the OS system volume."
"738","Received my Stick yesterday. Easy to set it up. Love that it has a microphone and it can easily/quickly find what I need. I also have two Roku sticks (and have had older models in the past). Already, I prefer the Fire Stick! Also happy about the price! Thanks, Amazon."
"739","Everything I expected and more. We bought this to give our xbox a rest from being our everything streamer. Not one problem setting everything up. It went smooth and fast. Alexa even recognizes what my 5 year olds sometimes unclear words are saying. I love the voice commands and it's quite interesting to ask Alexa questions which was an added bonus. I downloaded Kodi the day I got it and found it unnecessary really so it went bye bye but if you really want it just know it's possible. No ""jail breaking"" needed. I watched a YouTube tutorial and it was easy. I highly t commend Fire TV stick so far."
"740","The fire stick is great but it's kind of deceiving being able to download the apps and then some of the apps want to charge you, or you have to have a TV service provider to log in if you don't pay for an online streaming program. What's the use of downloading the apps if you've already got a TV service provider.. that's the whole point of getting the fire stick because you don't have cable."
"741","The stick works perfectly well and awesomely it now works with Crunchyroll so now I can stream my anime on my big tv"
"742","Excellent.  Go to your computer and google up the video on how to set it up.There are several different set up videos so you may have to scroll through and try them beforethe one is just like the setup screens that show up on your TV..But after you get the right video it is smooth sailing with great results...Including the latest movies showing..."
"743","I like the response on this new Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote. I am very impressed with it and would recommend it for anyone who is using Amazon Prime for movies or other Apps.  It is a great reliable product and highly recommended.  It is also not expensive."
"744","Best purchase in a while. Makes it easy to use amazon, netflix, pandora, etc all from the tv in one easy layout. My mom got one look and decided that's what she wants for Christmas. :) I haven't used the Alexa part yet, but the fire stick alone I'm really happy with."
"745","I think this is the third or forth maybe even fifth fire stick I have purchased. They never disappoint and always deliver. I have one on every TV in my house but one and I plan on putting a fire TV box on that one and if I don't it'll be another fire stick. Thanks Amazon."
"746","It is MUCH faster than the previous version.  I would have given it 5 stars if they would have figured out how to incorporate volume and mute buttons (it's such a P.I.A. to have to switch between 2 remotes all the time).  Amazon, PLEASE figure out how to add volume and mute buttons to your remote!"
"747","I love it!! its perfect. Love watching movies, TV shows and more. still learning how to use it, but its so worth it."
"748","This is a great product if you are only watching Hulu,Netflix, Amazon Prime, Etc... What this product lack in is it's capability to stream sports. We cannot stream sports without a horrible lag or constant freezing. We have Roku's as well, and I often have to switch the Firestick out with the roku stick on our main TV to stream sports. If Amazon could figure out how to make this device better for streaming sports then I would give it 5 stars. Until then... 3"
"749","I purchase the Amazon Fire TV Stick because I was told one can see series that you like when one want to watch them, and the person who told me was right.  Of course, one has to join Amazon Prime to take advantage of it, but for less than $12.00 dollars a month for what you get, you can't beat the price and the advantages of having the Fire Stick and Amazon Prime; I recommended 100 percent!"
"750","Love these in a major way, I have 3, one in each TV. Cable cord is cut!! All my movies in one place. From any device. Sling TV gets me ESPN and Prime gets me Thursday Night NFL!! Network TV is FREE THROUGH THE AIR!!! I am winning thanks to the FIRESTICK TV!! Please continue to take over my life Amazon...."
"751","3 stars because the unit does work well, I went from a roku to this because of the better layout for Sony ps Vue. Unfortunately all my purchased movies are on Vudu and google play, which even though the os is android based you have no access to google apps, only the Amazon store. I'll accept that since it was an impulse buy on sale and I didn't research. I would NOT have purchased if I had known that. Also, I find it more sluggish than the roku in selecting and finding shows and movies. In the long term if there is no access to google play, I will probably to back to roku in the future. I am not a fan of rooting and will not try it."
"752","This is my first time owning a firestick and I'm delighted with it. Especially when I travel and stay in hotel rooms I don't have to pay for movies or anything because I have my firestick very very happy with it.  I encourage you to buy this product  you will not regret it."
"753","This is a wonderful device if you can open it to install the batteries.  I have several of these and every one of them has been awful to try to open.  Come on Amazon, do something about this.  Fix it.  I should have to spend hours and hours to open a remote control."
"754","The first Amazon Fire stick remote I got did not work. Customer service was awesome and sent me a new remote and it works just fine. I returned the original one. I love this fire stick it's awesome to watch TV shows and movies. Don't know what I ever did without it!"
"755","Better than the first version but that's not saying much. The wifi connection is stable but apps are hit or miss. Netflix runs great but Direct TV Now was laggy and took forever to switch channels. For someone relying on this device for cord cutting experiences, you might find it frustrating depending on what apps you use. I have subbed to the big ones (direct tv now, PlayStation vue, and sling) sling works the best. Vue would sometimes boot you back to the main menu as well as other apps to."
"756","Love it - bought it because when my daughter took her Google Chromecast to college it wouldn't work with the dorm's WiFi.  Her friend had a Fire Stick and said it worked fine.  I don't know what the issue with the Chromecast was, but the Fire Stick works perfectly!!!  She is so happy with it.  She's able to watch all sorts of TV with it."
"757","The Fire TV Stick works well, but the remote is very slick, slippery!  I would rather the surface be textured, maybe even knurled.  And getting around the on-screen content is taking some time and practice to get used to.  I believe I will end up liking it better than the Chromecaast it replaced."
"758","The Fire TV Stick with Alexa works flawlessly for the objective of ""cord cutting"" cable TV.  While my cable company provided a quality connection and robust feature / functionality, the costs were high.  The Fire Stick is easy to use and there are more than enough applications to easily fulfill entertainment diversity and quality programming.Installation = easy and quickRemote Control = easy to use and intuitive - I like the cleaner (less buttons) on the commandAlexa Voice Command = Works well; however I do not use it.The product works as advertised and works well.  I highly recommend it and if you are looking at cutting the cord, this product is a great first step."
"759","This is my 5th Fire Stick- not because they wear out and break but because they are that awesome that I have cut cable and put a Fire stick on all of my tvs. So easy to use even my kids can handle it. This is my first Fire Stick since the upgrade or 2nd Generation. Love the new remote! Much better quality. I could take or leave the Alexa voice part (or maybe I just haven't learned to use her to her full ability yet). Either way, nicely done Amazon!"
"760","Dude!  I've had Amazon Prime for years,  and I have no idea what took me so long to get the Fire TV Stick.  This thing is AWESOME!!!  I have also been  a DISH customer for 20 years,  and yesterday I just terminated  all of my Pay movie  channels,  saving me $45.00 a month.  And I do not,  nor will I, miss those channels. ( I hardly watched them,  anyway).  Trust me.  Get the Fire stick.  I have NO regrets!!  (Oh,  and the Alexa remote is cool too)"
"761","Love it so much! I am a bit unhappy with the price of replacing the remote, as I misplaced mine shortly after purchasing the system. It is over $20 to replace which is a bit much. However, there is a remote app for your phone that is free of charge and incredibly user friendly. Amazon would absolutely be able to charge for the app or not provide one at all, therefore forcing users to purchase the $20 remote (which they would do so that they could still use and access their Fire Stick). The fact that they offer the app as an alternative to paying for a replacement remote at all, and especially free of charge, is great customer service and so, because of that, I’m sticking with a 5 star review."
"762","Issue when connecting to any hotel wifi - the login pages are generally long and the Fire TV Stick cursor will not go far enough down to allow any passcode or anything to be entered so I had to use my hotspot which took too much data.When connected to good wifi it is fairly fast to load apps, pages, shows or movies. Disappointed that I have to pay extra to view anything from certain networks (HBO, Starz, CBS, etc). Lots of apps available. Some TVs won't work with this unless you use the dongle and some TVs don't have enough power output from their USB ports to power the Stick so you have to plug it into the wall.Voice search doesn't recognize what should be easy words."
"763","I was surprised with the high quality video on my 1080p TV.  The picture quality is much better than my cable-based HD channels.It takes some getting use to the different model  of how internet TV works but I hope that we can cut the cord soon on our Cable subscription."
"764","This thing I like about the fire stick is when I start it, it automatically switches to the HDMI slot where the stick is plugged in. The thing I don't like about it if I have to manually the TV back to the cable HDMI. I would buy it again and recommend it to others."
"765","I'm a senior citizen and hate change, but..... this is probably one of my best decisions.  I asked my grandkids and then decided to buy the firestick.  Had my grandson change my tv over from directv to firestick.  It is easy to use, once I got used to it, and the picture is nice and clear.  The shows I watch are all there.  It was a good choice for inexpensive viewing."
"766","It was very easy to connect the stick to my TV and I have since enjoyed streaming shows and movies online. This is a perfect little gadget that works magic  at the touch of your finger. My days have been full of fun since I received it! HAPPY AND SATISFIED CLIENT :)"
"767","Thinking about returning this if the issue with screen calibration is not fixed. I was really happy with the product and how much faster it was until i found out that you cant calibrate the screen. I tried contacting Amazon but i got little help. They just gave me instructions on how to calibrate from the setting the way you would on the old fire stick. The function is not possible on the new one since they took it away. Hopefully this is fixed soon."
"768","I'm not liking the upgraded software. It is a little difficult to find your APP and this new stick is a little slow. There is a noticeable delayed response and it has ""frozen up"" and I've had to unplug to reboot the stick. I rarely have to do this with ROKU."
"769","This person, cannot stop bragging to mom about how amazing it is to have a fire stick and not pay for cable. Thank you amazon for creating such amazing unbelievable things. Soon I️ will be buying the 1st generation Alexa. My ex had it and we both freaking loved it."
"770","Well LOL I have a dumb t.v or at least one that's not as up to date with all the new apps and wifi so this has actually given my older 55"" a new life.  I have enjoyed it and watched many new shows between Amazon Prime and Netfilx.  Alexa is great for what it is, just makes me want the big girl and echo now but I have enjoyed this and recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade the sets."
"771","Absolutely love this remote.The first one that came with my stick was so hard to open it was practically glued together the pieces.I contacted amazon about this issue and the nice man I spoke with Danny sent me a new one.This one I managed to open with one thumb.Ever since I received the remote I have been watching television every chance I get.Thanks Amazon."
"772","VERY pleased.  I have lived with a ""smart TV"" that I always thought was sluggishly stupid.  Loading streaming data (or even starting the smart TV function) took many minutes.  And FF, RW was done blindly and nearly never landed where I hopped would.  To top it off, content, Amazon for example, would never go full screen.  All those complaints are gone with this stick.  And the remote is pretty slick.  I always wondered why someone would buy a device like this when their TV was already ""smart"" - now I know the answer.  Clearly the technology in this stick beats that in my Sony Bravia by miles.  If you have the same gripes with your TV, you will be sure to be as impressed as I have been with the stick."
"773","I can't believe the clarity of the pictures and movies on my tv. Offers so many options. Even a cheesy version of parental controls that I'm still trying to figure out. I am very satisfied with it. I do wish it was independent from all cable providers, but now that's dreaming."
"774","Amazing for on $40. So small, but it provides so much. We use it primarily for Netflix and there is actually a fair amount of Amazon prime content. Plus it is easy to add other Apps. Oh and the voice recognitions works great and you get Alexa. Can't beat it for $40"
"775","Best thing ever!!!!!!!!!!  Chrome cast is boo boo compare to this.  Wish I had bought it a long time ago. I can stream anything on my phone and car it on an older non smart TV.  Also it's super clear. Better than regular DVD quality. It's almost like note ready quality."
"776","Bought it as replacement for y google Chrome cast. Works way better and i like idea being able to connect multiple apps in one device. So far i have no issues with it and works very well for me. Very easy setup process took me around 3-5 minutes. Nice quality product."
"777","I had to buy this through one of Amazons pop up stores in the mall because online had been sold out for awhile and I needed it for Christmas. I got this for my grandma who watches hulu and netflix on her tablet and was originally going to buy her a whole new tv and get a smart tv but this seemed to be a cheaper and easier option. Its Christmas Eve, its all setup, and now were watching Grantchester on Prime Video. Grandma loves it, I love it, and its super easy to use. Just say what she wants and it comes up. This is an awesome idea and a great gift. Were both super happy with the product. If i didnt have a smart tv already, id buy another one of these for myself. Absolutely fantastic gift."
"778","I received the fire TV stick as promised. I was somewhat disappointed in the instructions given for effectively using the functionality of the Fire stick or procedures for navigating around the Fire Stick. There was not any HELP given as to what procedures are needed to utilize the Fire stick. One of the features not given was the capability to 'side load' other applications on the fire stick. I could not find any in-depth instructions for using all the capabilities of the Fire stick. Other then the above, for the price, you get the functionalities noted.It's like getting a new car with all the bells and whistles but not getting a user manual to help you use those bells and whistles."
"779","I purchased my firestick on black friday because it was an awesome deal. Up until now, I've relied on an HDMI cable connected to my computer for netflix because I don't have an internet ready HDTV and the firestick is *so* much easier for that purpose with better picture quality. I've been very impressed so far, between all the prime content, music, and ability to use apps I won't miss anything canceling my TV subscription when the contract is up. I'm not sure the value would be as great without also being a prime subscriber, but I use prime for so many things I won't be dropping it any time soon. The interface is very easy to use for navigating to your favorites & discovering new content."
"780","I bought four of these for each of my TV's and then I called Time Warner and I cancel my cable I'm saving about $100 a month by just using a couple paid subscription Hulu and Sony vue. It great i cut the cable save money and have more choices. Now the bad news. Amazon list a lot of free apps and some are free but most of them are not. To find out you must first download the app, then install  it, then open it, then choose a show you then get a code that you need to go to the app Web site, then enter that code, have your email checked, you then find out that the ABC free app is not free to use. Amazon should have a list of the apps that are truly free and a list for the ones that have a fee associated with it."
"781","The Fire TV Stick has a great UI and app lineup. Overall, I have found this to be a good product with minimal negative aspects. I really only have two primary complaints:1.) The Fire TV Stick has poor range for receiving WiFi signal. Supporting 5 Fire TV Sticks in my household required me to add WiFi range extenders and an additional access point. The numerous other devices on my wireless network had no trouble with my previous set-up.2.) The Fire TV Stick requires a wireless network connection. Since we are talking about a lot of HD video streaming, I would appreciate the ability to hard-wire the device."
"782","I would give the Fire TV stick 5 stars but, I am having issues with the way its functioning...  I would like to know, is there a way to reset or shut the Fire stick off, I know to unplug it to reset it and I found the sleep mode but, when binge watching my favorite TV show the system locks up.I tried resetting my modem also.currently I have 3 Fire TV sticks (one for each TV in the house) and I am switching between them to be able to watch TV using the stickplease help, thanks"
"783","I love firestick a this is my third one purchasing. Cable is so overrated flipping through channels not knowing what to watch. The firestick is the best thing ever invented. As long as you got good internet and clear you cache you will be all set with no buffering"
"784","Enjoyed using it for the few days that i used it, Loaded Kodi on it and found it much more useful however i did notice some lagging when streaming some content. I will admit i do have alot of wifi connected devices being used so that probably plays into some of the laggy-ness. Many cell phones , laptops, ipads, in my household sucking up all the wifi bandwidth. It did get better when most of the devices were shut down or not in use. I opted for the Amazon Fire TV for the hardwired capability instead , and will be giving this away as a gift to a friend. Would definitely recommend especially after loading Kodi. Now only if Amazon does not block Kodi in the near future this will continue to be a very popular item"
"785","I am glad I purchased it but I don't know what I would do without my other another programs. This just seems to be at a portal to many other programs. I am not that happy with the voice command. The voice command needs work. For a one time purchase, it is just ok."
"786","The remote drains batteries. I imagine that's because the microphone is probably always on whether we want it to be or not. This leads to the remote being constantly disconnected. I will need to open the remote, remove the battery, then put it back in just to get the remote to connect to the stick again. If I replace the battery, it'll stay connected for a longer period. Like a week. But, awesome product. I don't have Prime, but it's great for running Kodi. It handles HD. Maybe not the best quality you can get, but definitely HD."
"787","I have two Fire TV boxes and needed a third. I decided to try the Fire TV Stick instead of the Fire TV Box and boy was I glad. Not only it is cheaper, it works just as good at the box. I love the Fire tv's and highly recommend them. Easy to use, fast and voice search. They are definitely the best of streaming devices."
"788","I like the Fire TV stick. I have two smart TV's but was given a TV that doesn't have smart TV capabilities. I am so spoiled by smart TV's that I didn't quite know what to do with this one, so I invested in the Fire TV stick. This gives me the same applications and functions as my Roku TV's. Very inexpensive, easy to set up, and user friendly!"
"789","I have 2 fire TV boxes and a fire TV stick. The stick was new to me, but once I figured out how to download files to it, I copied my kodi configuration to it and had the same as my two boxes. The boxes have a USB port so u was used to that. The stick only has WiFi and it works great on Amazon, hbo go, Hulu and direct TV now. I gave 4 star because the power cord for the stick is a little short for where my tv is and the plug."
"790","UPDATE 07/29/17 -- This is our third Fire TV stick for another tv in our home.  We recommend this to everyone.We already had one of the original FireTV. . .this Fire TV Stick works just as well as the original and at a very reduced price.  Actually I got this on Black Friday for the $29.99 sale price.  I believe that I have FINALLY convinced my husband to get rid of our cable tv subscription.  By switching to an internet only subscription, and then adding SlingTV, we will be SAVING about $120.00 a month AND will still get all the ""TV"" channels he wants and needs, including live Fox Sports 1, Fox and ESPN, along with all the videos from Amazon and Netflix.  I am so excited to finally cut the cord with cable TV, and boosting our internet speed."
"791","I am so glad we got this ! My husband likes to watch movies in the winter. We were paying ridiculous amounts of money all year to have movie channels with our satellite company for just a few months. At first it took me a bit to talk him in to it because he is not tech savvy at all and didn't understand how much more he would be able to choose from, including TV series. Plus, our satellite would go out because of weather conditions making him a very unhappy camper. We don't watch TV a lot, but it's frustrating when it goes out. I went ahead and ordered it knowing he would like it too, and I was right! He realized it isn't hard to operate and we like that fact that we can just ask Alexa!!!"
"792","I like the fire stick. I rely on it for pretty much all entertainment needs, I do KODI ( its doesnt work as well as the box, but still works) netflix, news, youtube ect. Super handy I hope everyone gets a firestick and turn off the cable cuz that crap is a rip off."
"793","The device was easy to install, there were simply written directions that included how to use the enhancements such as the Kodi app. I did need to ask for help from a Millennial in clearing the cache to help it to run more smoothly."
"794","It just arrived this morning. It was easy to install, and easy to install apps like Netflix and DirectvNow, and it works very well.  I plugged the usb charger cord into the usb port on the back of my tv and this seems to power the stick adequately.  With Alexa voice, it is so easy to switch between apps, just say the app name instead of going to Home and scrolling up and down.  This was the free unit that came for prepaying one month of DirectvNow.  I can't wait for the second unit that I bought through Prime to arrive later today.  This was way faster and easier to set up than my Roku Express sticks. I'm thinking my husband will want to drop cable tv once he learns how to work the remote :-)"
"795","Love this !!  It enabled me to view photos from my tablet and play games in addition to turning my older TV's into smart TV's which allows me access to watch my Amazon Prime movies,  and much more.  You have music options as well.  I'm not good at explaining things but hopefully you understand  :)  I Couldn't believe how easy it was to hook up and was watching in five minuets!  Questions? Amazon is right there to answer them!  I have used it on two TV's  and everyone loves it as much as I do.  A must have !!"
"796","Much better than I had anticipated.  I have a Roku on my living room TV and love it so was not sure how this would do in comparison.  It is better by far.  The processor is much fast and there is no lag time whatsoever.  Super easy to set up and was watching Prime videos in no time at all.  I should say that the silly remote control is a HUGE pain to open up.  I had to go to YouTube to find a way to open it that was short of throwing it at a brick wall.  The secret is using a pair of rubber gloves to get a good grip and push up and out.  It is easierafter that.  Excellent price, quick delivery thanks to Prime, and really a super product that lives up to and exceeds expectations.  Buy it."
"797","Simplifies signing on different apps to use the resources I have. Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, PBS, YouTube, and the list goes on...Plug it in a USB port, then plug power cord into an electric outlet.Push Home to turn on and it turns on my TV as well."
"798","The cord supplied with the the Firstick is ant an HDMI cord but a USB cord. This contradicts the instructions.I see there is a contract involved here. The first month free then $20 a month.Things are not what they seem.Why didn't the reviewers mention this?"
"799","I am loving my new Fire TV Stick, have had Roku for years, and loved those and still have a couple on other TV's but will probably replace them when I have to with the new Fire Stick... Still working on all the good things it does, but do make use of Alexa often.  If you are considering it I would say  go for it.. buy it.. it is a bit different from the Roku, but the price is great and I think you will be plaease when you start to use it."
"800","Fantastic for cutting the cord.  We have this hooked to a 1080p monitor, and the display is great.  We haven't tried it with any 4k content.  Only complaint is that the USB power cord is a bit too short for wall mounting with a baseboard level outlet.  We could all use a couple more inches."
"801","We finally cut cable. After a few months, I can truly say... we don't miss it. Product works great and paired with Prime, loads of great stuff to watch & listen to... with no commercials! I also like being able to ask it questions, like ""what time is it?"""
"802","One of several we own.  Breakthrough tech, easy install and use.  Actually prefer the fire stick  over the ""smart"" tv's we own.  Firestick is faster, plus  will be cheap to upgrade if needed. (had a problem with on stick remote.  Replace rapidly by Amazon!"
"803","Have only used to Fire TV Stick a couple times.  Takes a bit of time to get use to it and how to use the voice commands so it understands you.  But so far with the few things I've used it for.. no complaints.I do put my Fire TV Stick to ""Sleep"" each time I am finished using it, but so far I haven't seen much increase in my Data Usage on my internet connection.  That I am happy about."
"804","We were wanting to quit our satellite tv after they raised our bill $30 a month.  We already had a roku box but it's an old one.  I liked the idea of the stick being plugged in and no box sitting on my tv stand with the wires.  The second thing that made me to decide on this was the Alexa Voice Remote.  I just push the button and tell Alexa what I want to see and it pops up without all the searching.  We cut out our Satellite and it's been about 3 weeks and we haven't looked back.  The installation was flawless and we already were Prime members for about 4 years and we were up and going in about 10 minutes.  You won't be sorry if you get this.  Just wish I had down the switch long ago."
"805","Dispensed with cable.Minimized TV watching to 1 hour, once per week, free, parent approved shows only.Several free quality options.News app required for news hungry adults.Prime members- lots of free, quality video options.Changed Netflix to streaming, and they offer fewer movie options with streaming.Pros- one time purchase, easy hook up, no commercials ever, voice navigated with Alexa."
"806","We love it! It's easy to install and user friendly. The kids use Alexa to make searching easier. We use Netflix, Amazon and Hulu for viewing and have an antenna for local channels, our local cable provider isn't an option in the apps...but we are okay with that!"
"807","Love it..easy to Hanover and content is huge..also Ammazon makes it easy to sign up or delete the Dr e channels that did not work for us...we had the big  'D' satellite  receiver for years..this is so much better and huge savings to watch what  we want.  Love it"
"808","I like the 2nd gen FireStick better than the first. It doesn't crash at all and actually stays connected to my WiFi. When I received my device, it was already connected to my account unlike my first one. It also carried over all my apps and channels I already used from my laptop and 1st gen FireStick. No complaints."
"809","This was a gift. We are still getting used to it. It is a little difficult to operate. Alexa does not always respond to our commands. We really haven't found much viewing that is to our liking, so not sure what we are doing wrong! Our kids love their fire stick."
"810","This stick performs wonderfully for viewing and searching. But I can't figure out how to put in parental controls on purchases without also having to put in a passcode every time I change apps. I specifically went into settings and turned off controls on app launches, but it demands them anyway."
"811","So far so good.  Just make sure you have a password to protect anyone from accidentally saying something causing Alexa to put an order in you didn't expect. :) You can set parental controls too.  Just working on figuring out how to mirror the fire stick with my android phone."
"812","we have two different wifi tv systems, the fire stick is by far the best. I don't use the voice controller, but if you are looking for a new way to beat the high cost of cable or satellite this is a great way to go. easy to load all your television aps but does need to be rebooted from time to time but so worth it when you realize you can save 100s by ditching the companies."
"813","We don't have cable, but we do have a subscription to all of the services (hulu, netflix, etc.).  One of our TVs didn't allow for access to these, so the firestick was the perfect solution to that problem.  Easy to install and even easier to use.  Great product."
"814","Installation took about 3-5 minutes and then I was off and running searching Amazon and trying out the YouTube app.The remote is very nice and operates on Bluetooth and not infrared.  Makes it very convenient when listening to music while doing things around the house to change playlists or mute it for phone calls.  The voice interface so far is about 90%-95% accurate for me.  My only complaint with it is that it won't interface with the YouTube app (or any other app it seems), requiring you to use the remote buttons to enter search strings.  Very inconvenient.  The Bluetooth keyboard (available separately) supposedly interfaces with these apps but voice is so much easier."
"815","I bought mine at Best Buy because I didn't want to wait. Plex and Kodi work flawlessly on it, unlike the Roku stick I tried which doesn't even support Kodi.NOTE: For those complaining about powering it on and off by power source, just connect the power USB cable to a USB port on your TV instead. That way it will only power on when your TV is on."
"816","Better interface than a smart TV for your netflix, hulu, and Amazon Prime, and this also has more apps, like the Jackbox party games, which are awesome if you have a group of adults coming over and you want to play games without worrying about cards or board games."
"817","The Fire TV Stick itself works great so far, and technically merits 5 stars.However, I was almost ready to return the Stick's remote as DOA until I noticed something that is either a blatant design flaw or somehow made it through QC. The battery direction imprinted on my remote was backwards. This is my 2nd Stick (I also have a 1st generation Stick in addition to this 2nd generation Stick). The batteries are supposed to be inserted in the same direction on both Sticks. However, the direction imprinted on my new 2nd generation Stick was backwards. Once I realized that the flat (-) side of the battery could not touch the (-) terminal I flipped the batteries and now everything works."
"818","For $40 - wow.  This streaming stick is great - super fast speed (as far as streaming sticks go), tons of channels and great design. I've had two generations of Roku and two generations of Fire TV. This is my favorite hands down due to the fast processing power and slick ""no buffering"" streaming functionality. There are more capable devices if you are willing to spend more - but for less than $50 - there is nothing better on the market. The only negative remark I have for this device is that there is no VUDU channel available unless to go the side load route (which I have no desire to do). I have had the more expensive Fire TV box before - that was a great experience as well."
"819","Remember when water used to be free?  Who would have ever thought that one day we would be paying to drink water to replenish our body supply?  Well, same thing with television.  Who would have ever thought that one day we would have to pay to watch news and entertainment?  I'm thankful for the Firestick for bringing back ""free"" television viewing (wifi charges only).  Cable and Satellite have made millions, perhaps billions of dollars from customers. I hope they get run out of business!  I love the Firestick!  I tell everyone I come in contact with to dismiss the ""Dish,"" table the ""Cable"" and go ""Direct"" to the ""Stick,"" it has them ALL licked!"
"820","I was really excited about my purchase on the Fire Stick.. I should have done a little more research because I figured I would purchase the firestick, and with my Prime Membership would be able to watch stations of my choice. However, when I got the Fire Stick and connected it to my TV I then learned that I have to pay a separate monthly subscription for every channel that I want to view programs for. Showtime, Cinemax, ESPN, Starz etc...."
"821","this stick is cute but appears somewhat fragile, be gentle when changing batteries. it works nicely BUT it comes preloaded with account info I would prefer not to have loaded and in many ways programmed like Apple TV with pay for everything apps charged right to your Amazon act, even the youtube is a subscription to VEVO not the same youtube I like, but It can be programmed to get other APPS if you like,,,it can make any tv a smarter tv.it has HDMI cable for modern tvs and if you have an older tv I believe you can get cables for that too.all in all after tweaking it it's a nice device"
"822","Fantastic  so easy to set up and use  Amazon's library is huge and with Alexa it is a breeze to find things. NO SCROLLING to waste time  just ask and boom.  Streams with no lag and has great HD.  I live in the boonies so even wifi is satellite and it works fine"
"823","I was using a Nintendo Wii to watch my Netflix and Hulu...until it crashed and burned so I decided to try this instead of another Wii.  I was pleasantly surprised how much more user-friendly this is to use!!!  So much easier to use the remote on the Fire stick,"
"824","Love our fire stick.  Hurt my back and was laid up for a week and with the fire stick i was able to rewatch all the Downton Abbey shows.  So convenient  being able to watch whatever I want whenever I feel like it.  Thank you Amazon for another terrific product."
"825","Along with my echo and kindles (both paper white and fire) the Fire Stick is another great Amazon product. I feel a little embarrassed how much of a brand devotee I am with this company but they make good stuff. Almost no install time and it is lightening fast."
"826","The fire stick is the best thing to come out. I'm able to watch anything i want. Local Tv networks and all movies old and new. I mean there is so much to watch on this fire stick. I got rid of my cable service and brought the fire stick.You still need internet in order for the fire stick to work, but its worth getting rid of cable. And i'm good with that."
"827","Is very slow. I have an apple TV and the Firestick is not as smooth; HOWEVER, it isn't bad for this price. If I recommend it it to people I'm going to let them know it'll lag from time to time. And the interface is kind of clunky. But besides those things, it's not bad."
"828","This is my second Fire Stick. I was using something else in my bedroom, but was not getting good reception,as my router is in my living room. I decided to try the Fire Stick in my room and wow! no problem with wifi. I thank you for a wonderful product. Everyone should have one."
"829","I have bought 2 of these and I couldn't be any happier! It came in the mail on time. It's so easy to navigate and I no longer have to pay for cable! It is definitely something I recommend to people at least once a week! I love my Amazon Fire Sticks!"
"830","CUT THE CABLE CORDS!! I'm not sure why I was so hesitant but I am so glad I decided to just give this a try.  We love it!!  We already have Netflix, we signed up for Amazon Prime ($91/yr which is only $7.58/month!!!) and Sling TV.  I will say it has been so good to ask ""Alexa"" to find this and that and ... POOF there it is!  We were getting over 200 cable channels and over the last 2 months we hardly strayed from 4 or 5 of the same channels with same shows on over and over.  This has been such a wake up call for us and there is so much to Amazon Prime that my daughter can watch and learn during her tv time!  Do it!"
"831","I just set mine up last night and it was super easy! I logged into all of my streaming services, set my preferences and was ready to go! So much better than cable! And, I love ALL of the different app options you have. Don't know why it took me so long to buy this!"
"832","BUY IT. It's cheap,  portable, and gives you access to everything. It's a no brainer for multiple televisions."
"833","Replaced the old fire stick (which was pretty much crap) with this new one. What a difference! I've been on it everyday for the past week and have watched countless movies and shows with not even a hint of a problem. And, Alexa is convenient. Love it, love it, love it!"
"834","Love the Firestick even though the basic stuff that you think will be free.....isn't, as people assumes. You know what happens when you assume though. Definitely cut my cable bill by $100.00. Had a problem with one of the them, but instead of going through the hassle after emailing them I just purchased another one. If I would of received my Protection Plan paperwork, I would've taking another route."
"835","LOVE the Firestick!  What a great alternative option to expensive cable packages.  Easy to install and super-fast delivery.  Still in the exploring mode of all its functionality, but am happy so far!  Will be purchasing additional sticks for other TV locations."
"836","Still trying to use it to access an existing subscription service, but running into roadblocks. Delayed in further checkout, but when trying to access Netflix, it errors because my billing information in my Amazon account is incomplete. I prefer that way, so I won't be billed for something I didn't ask for. I only need the stick to access Netflix, that I have already been accessing by my Wii device. ConfusedUpdate, after putting in a billing address, with no credit info, I now have access.  Works fine for what I want."
"837","This is not a fair review as I only got the Fire Stick installed two days ago. So far it seems OK but I am a little disappointed to learn that I need to become a ""Prime"" member to be able to utilize more options. I probably will not do that right away..."
"838","The more I use it the more I love it. I am still learning the things the Fire TV Stick can do but I am very happy so far. I recently purchased an antenna because the price of Comcast cable has gotten so high and I wanted to see if I can do without cable tv. The hardest part for me will be losing the DVR ability to schedule the recordings of shows I want to watch, so if anyone has a work-around for that please let me know.Between the antenna and the Fire Stick and amazon prime shows and movies, I think this may work out and at a substantial savings.The Fire TV Stick was very easy to install and the provided adapter allowed me to use it on my older (10 yr) TV."
"839","Pros: It works well. The interface is easy to use and set up. Most of the apps run without issue and pretty much every network has an app.Cons: Switching between apps is a little disjointed, there is not a lot of free content (with out having a cable subscription) especially in the way of live tv, and the subscriptions to many of the services adds up quickly back to the price range of having cable. Not quite the versatile cord cutting device I was hoping for. Also the content and apps you don't have are listed first and easiest to access while the content you have downloaded gets buried in the selection guide."
"840","I bought two of them, both worked as advertised, however I have only one detraction perhaps someone can help me?  Many times when I turn on the TV (after the TV has been off for a few hours or more) the Firestick information does not come up and I have to unplug the Firestick from the wall and plug it back in....it will then work...has anyone else experienced this problem?"
"841","The good, I have uograded from an older version of the firestick to this newer version. The newer version is well worth the upgrade!!! It is at least twice as fast as the older one. There is no downside here what so ever!! You zip by the apps with lag time. The apps open up very fast and run great without crashing. The packaging is great, you recieve everything you need to get you up and running, it even brings batteries for the remote. Speaking of the remote, very light weight and comfortable. The voice feature is very handy and easy to use, in case you don't want to type anything. There is no ugly here!!  Well if you thought this review was helpful smash the I found this useful button!!!"
"842","Had to return it as Charter / Spectrum is not one of the cable companies that is available for streaming services. I got a Roku and that worked."
"843","The headline is for the hard headed engineer's.  This works great without taking up much space. However the remote constantly needs rebooting for no apparent reason. Seriously the remote sucks, good thing there's an app or my second firestick would be useless."
"844","After opening and removing all items from package (more items than expected) attempted to insert battery into fire stick but it was hard to remove the back cover; required more force than it should have needed.After that it was easy to assemble and install onto my HD TV.  I forgot the password for my new AC class router so the wps button was the quick solution, no buffering. Very satisfied."
"845","I just recently received and installed the firestick. Installed kodi and it works marvellous. Netflix tends to buffer a lot, I'm deducting 1 star due to that reason. The processor hold up well for some game and video. Screen mirroring works well when it works, I will update on that on later date. Overall, it's good.Also, your phone could be used as another remote or as a backup, so no need to purchase another one."
"846","I don't use the voice features often, but the speed of this thing us great. Connectivity is great, I also love the parental controls and how it links with my Amazon seamlessly. My only complaint is the size of this thing. I feel like it is huge, and it blocks other HDMI ports on the back of my television"
"847","There's no significant difference between this model and the old. I dont tend to use the speech functions on my devices like others.With that said, I absolutely love the fire stick!! I dumped my Apple TV into storage and bought 3 of these wonderful devices. It has far more options than the apple does!!"
"848","I like the firestick. However, we have slow internet which causes some buffering. Also we are unable to use any other devices if we are watching a movie. This has nothing to do with the firestick itself!  Just a warning for others that might have slow internet."
"849","Amazing especially because of its capabilities. It works perfectly with the hdmi slot on the tv, as long as you have a good wifi connection, no buffering. Its size make it portable and easy to watch on any tv anywhere. Amazon prime has a large library of content to pick from. This is pretty cool."
"850","I just wish I could add apps. I have a show I want to watch on go90 and can't add it. The remote is easy to use and I love that my three year old can easily get to Netflix. The voice choice doesn't work for me because I use apps to watch TV and don't have Prime."
"851","I didn't notice when ordering that it had the Alexa feature, something I will never use. I have another Fire Stick without it and prefer having the selector at the top rather than the Alexa button. It would have been better to put Alexa at the bottom. In general, I'm happy with both. One downside is that you download a ""free Ap"" such as the History Channel or Hallmark but it won't let you watch much. I have no idea why. I'd like to delete them but don't know how."
"852","Sooo the fire stick I received doesn’t work and I’m super surprised and unhappy. It’s weird because this is my second one and the first one worked fine."
"853","It's great few glitches like disconnects from hulu and has to buffer in loading few other apps but over all its great and I love how u can ask questions like ""what is tomorrow's forecast ?"" Or even order food and other items from prime now with 2 hrs delivery with ur prime membership.only thing I wasn't excited about was it doesn't ask for a parental code for purchases and my 2 year old ordered jurassic world pressing buttons on the remote ."
"854","The new one is faster than the first gen model, which is a good thing. I did have a mechanical issue with the remote, and Amazon's excellent customer service handled it smoothly, replacing the whole unit. Did have to re-install all my apps, but it was a rainy day here anyway..... Have not used the voice feature much, seems to work well, but time will tell if it lives up to the hype."
"855","The all-New Fire TV Stick w/Alexa Voice Remote works great!  We already have Apple TV, but wanted to watch Amazon prime videos on our TV so we basically purchased the Fire TV Stick for that purpose.The installation was very easy, much easier than installing the Apple TV by the way, and we're very happy with our purchase.  The Fire-Stick controller is larger and more substantial than the controller for Apple TV, and much easier to handle.Not only are we able to watch Amazon prime movies, etc., but we are also able to access Hulu and Netflix, Sling TV plus many others as well.  It's a great product.The Alexa Voice Remote function works very well too.  I would highly recommend this product."
"856","Love my new Fire TV Stick! Still learning to use my stick but so far it is fairly easy to navigate and I love that I can take the Fire TV stick with my anywhere. I do wish the part that actually plugs into the TV was longer, it comes with an adapter but only extends a couple inches (harder to plug into TV's that are wall-mounted.)"
"857","Amazing little device we have here. Works wonders, rarely freezes up. As long as you have a good wifi stream it does fine. Everythimg you could think to watch. Has so many options to choose from to stream from. We love it. We canceled our cable and just use this now."
"858","I cancelled my cable tv due to the cost kept rising and channel selection continued to decline.  Purchased this and it well worth the $40!  I don't watch much tv, but this actually has me watching movies occasionally!  If you are looking for a way to cut high cable/dish/satellite costs, this is a great beginning!"
"859","Easy to install & setup. One issue that I found is the stick can't figure out what to do should you have duplicate channels. You will have to speak the app name then the show. Took me a few times to get it. The stick will drop you in a pay to view app. Overall, I'm happy with how it works."
"860","I thought I wanted to return this when the remote stopped working. It wasn't until I held the home button down for 60 seconds did it pair again to the tv. It could definitely use some improvements, & there is a learning curve to get this to its full potential, but not a bad purchase. Will buy again for the guest bedroom."
"861","This was an impulse buy for Black Friday.  So glad I purchased it because it works really well specially for Prime members.  You can stream your Prime shows/movies and free music a la Pandora.  Netflix is also easily accessible with the stick.  We love it so much that we just ordered a 2nd one for our upstairs TV."
"862","Love my new amazon fire stick.  Sobe I'm a prime member.  I have all sorts of shows and movies available to me.  The Fire Stick is small and convenient to carry around on your travels and wherever there is awifi connection you can have tv and movies to watch."
"863","The only thing a little weird about this is the odd way it goes into the TV and then has to be plugged in. Still, it's a great deal, works great, and is inexpensive.Not sure what we would do if it were a TV up on a wall ... the power cord would not be good then."
"864","I absolutely love the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote. It exceeded my expectations by how user friendly it is and how many options it gives for only a one time fee of $39.99.  I've tried it for almost a week and my husband and I decided we are getting rid of our cable.  I can get everything I want by purchasing the one time fee of $39.99 for the Fire TV Stick and SLING at $20 per month vs $148 that I pay monthly for cable.  Now my monthly bill will be $20 per month. I'm so grateful to Amazon for offering this at such an amazing price considering everything it offers and to SLING for everything it offers as well.  I was in doubt at first but now I'm a believer.  Absolutely awesome and highly recommend!!"
"865","I went with the Fire TV stick for my bedroom TV. I deducted one star because this needs to be plugged into an outlet - something not readily apparent given it plugs into the TV.Other than that, flawless performance out of the box. Easy setup - works well."
"866","Easy to use however opening the remote to install the batteries was horrible. I couldn't even open it and once it was open I couldn't get it to close properly. If you have poor grip, arthritis or any other issues with your hands do not purchase this. I have no issues with my hands yet I still could not open the back. In fact I got scratches now from having to try to pry it open. It's supposed to slide open using your thumbs but the remote is too skinny and the factory made dip in it to slide it does not work. It's next to impossible to hold a too small remote and use two thumbs to slide it open. In all honesty I should be returning this Fire stick for this reason only. So this is why it gets 3 stars"
"867","I like it. I tried directv now and live tv streaming with reliable cable wifi. I did not know you needed fast cable Internet.  12 mbps was recommended. Live tv streaming was little shaky at times. If you are an amazon prime member, there is lot of free movies and shows to see."
"868","love it! makes it easy to watch stuff on our amazon account - and i am sure there are many other capabilities I haven't even figured out yet! i think we can also access netflix and hulu on it...and probably a million other things. Will be GREAT for traveling"
"869","This truly is plug and play.  Netflix and Prime are so much better.  We were using an old Wii 2, and there was lots of buffering.  So glad I found this, and the price was terrific.  The voice remote works with no set-up.  I am very pleased with this product."
"870","We are a little disappointed with it because we were told you could get some news and tv shows, which now are recorded.  I do like Alexa, she gets us updated on the weather everyday and helps with selecting music. Would I recommend Fire TV Stick, absolutely."
"871","This works as explained, but has not been the success that I'd hoped.  We bought several for our apartment tenants, hoping to wean them from expensive cable TV.  The tenants are very resistant and are disappointed about the lack of live news/sports. Our property manager is frustrated with trying to teach them how to use the system and especially with the non English (Spanish) tenants who want it set up in Spanish. Our next step may be to purchase Hulu subscriptions for them to try."
"872","Made an old TV into a smart TV with lots of options. I also have a Roku basic stick on another TV. The Roku is $5 less and seems to offer a lot of the same features. To enjoy the fire stick at its fullest need to be an Amazon Prime customer and download Kodi"
"873","So far so good. I received it on Monday but didn't pick it up from my post office until today (Wednesday). As soon as I got home, I opened the box. Everything in the package was brand new. I went to insert the batteries but couldn't get the cover off, even after following the directions. Finally 7 minutes later, I was able to get the battery cover off. I instantly went to install Kodi since I've been hearing everyone talk about it. It took about 30 minutes to install because the first time I tried, the setup didn't work because the directions I viewed on youtube was an older version, so I had to start over. The 2nd time I tried it took 15 minutes (just had to find the right video guide). I'm loving my fire stick so far."
"874","Loving it,  Been watching it nonstop since  I got it. Sometimes it stops fast forwarding and I have to close and reopen a show if I want it to rewind or fast forward, but other than that it is perfect. Never will have cable again.UPDATE:The rewind and fast forwarding problem is no longer an issue.  There must have been an automatic update which corrected the issue."
"875","If you do not have a 'smart tv' and enjoy Amazon or Netflix - this is a must.  We love it!  Pretty easy set-up... if you have any issues, read some of the step-by-step instructions in other reviews - they are very helpful.  (Thank you to those of you who take the time to post them!)"
"876","Voice recognition has a few potholes in the learning curve, but I really enjoy this device!!! Access to so many movies, programs, apps & channels will have me setting ""Fire"" to my satellite tv bill shortly.I was paying $80 for DTV and getting almost zero decent programs for my family to watch. We already had Netflix, but the Fire Stick makes it simpler to access. We are trying SlingTV too and likewise find it easy to operate with the Stick.I might still spend $60 per month with these services, but I'm getting much more programming from which to choose. Amazon Fire Stick is a great platform and will be even more enjoyable as I learn to use Alexa more efficiently."
"877","I was totally surprised at how easy it was to install the fire stick. Just for information when you plug the stick into the HDMI port (most smart TV's have 3 or more) you must go to your TV source and choose the same setting as the HDMI port then the remote will pair with the TV, Continue to follow the instructions and your TV watching will instantly expand."
"878","This product is a real game changer! I have a smart tv and a conventional one and the firestick delivers better quality in picture and connectivity than the smart tv which is hard wired to the same modem. The extent of programming and versatility is unparalleled. I have barely scratch the surface with some of the apps and I am more than pleased, so I bought another firestick for the other TV because with the low price point it's just a no brainer."
"879","It allows me to fully watch the shows that I get from Amazon. I would not recommend buying any streaming programs from Amazon unless you purchase a firestick. I like the feature which allows me to find programs with the talking feature makes ease of use better."
"880","I only recently figured out what a Fire stick was!  I have an old Sony Bravia tv that has a great picture and just did not want to replace it for a smart tv. Someone suggested the fire stick and it is awesome!  I can get to all the things that I can on my smart tv!  So that saved me at least $1000!  I highly recommend this item."
"881","Price is no doubt one of the best reasons to buy this specific model of Amazon fire Tv. Amazing packaging and all the the you might need in the box included with what you pay. Many different choices of apps, games and the fact that is Mobile and you can take anywhere with you and connect to any tv as long you have an Amazon Prime account and connect to the internet. Option to connect a control and play games as well. If you are an Amazon subscriber this is an ideal product to do a lot great streaming. Once apps load the speed of the loading times for movies are amazingly fast. No lagging. Screen mirroring between your phone and the device is possible to 3rd party app choices."
"882","The Fire TV Stick was reasonable to set up and works fine for the items I've been able to watch so far, mostly Netflix. I have a Linksys AC1200+ router and so far all of the programs have worked very well. I love watching the old TV series without all the advertising.I don't understand why I must identify DirectV to set up and watch Tennis Channel Everywhere and CNNgo. What if I discontinued Direct TV - Will Tennis Channel Everywhere and CNNgo still work? That is an unknown to me that I haven't asked support about this subject yet.I've used the Alexa Voice a bit, but not enough to rate it at this time. Overall, I think the Fire TV Stick borders on fantastic."
"883","See my review for ""Smart Movies.""  Otherwise its kind of hard to describe what you get with fire stick... the content is somewhere between everything and nothing.  It's good for cheap people like me who refuse to pay for cable and detest satellite dishes."
"884","I'm used to an nvidia shield for smart tv streaming apps, so I may be biased (as that is MUCH more expensive) but this thing runs slow, and frequently drops signal to my wireless router causing interruptions in viewing. For the price it is worth it, but higher cost options work better for what it does (obviously i guess)."
"885","Omg i cannot believe it! So impressed because it's very easy to use just plug and play! It can play music, movies, checking the weather etc... my fave toy as of this moment. I hope the quality is great that it will last long! But for now, it's just simply awesome!"
"886","I LOVE this. I didn't realize Alexa was part of this... But I just reordered dog food through my tv remote. Really. So cool. I've been using Roku for several years and didn't want to switch because I like having all of my remote the same- but it's worth it."
"887","Just purchased and used for 1 week. Easy set up and eliminated the need to stream from one of our lap tops. The voice control is a bit buggy, (thus 4 vs. 5 stars), but the convenience is great. That noted, it is similar to Siri for iPhone users. The only ongoing requirement is to switch the input source on the TV when using a cable box, antenna, or DVD player. I found it much better and easier than using our Samsung DVD player as the linking device of balancing a lap top on a nearby stool, shelf, or the floor, especially with pets, kids, or visitors about. I am purchasing a second unit for the second TV. If you have access to Amazon Prime videos, I recommend one for each TV."
"888","It's able to run APS on it... So other words it's like a mini computer/smat phone. Got it on sale then got 10 bucks for first perchased App on fire stick (free APP)so made it 10 free and clear off .that made it over all cheap for what it can do. It could be faster with add ons but will not take a star off because for what it says it can do, it does well .. smooth over all to use. Only thing is like everything else if u know what you can do with this then it's great. If you don't know what all you can do with this or unwilling to research to understand what u can install on it. Then it just becomes something else u don't use much if at any unless u willing to pay for content."
"889","I am not an early adopter, even though I love technology and am always thrilled when I get something new.  I just never saw the need, until I did.  This thing is AWESOME.  Actually, I'm glad I waited because the voice activated remote is huge.  It works great, and I absolutely love that (my current cable provider has it, and frankly it's kind of the reason I'm staying with them.)Set up was a breeze.  From the box, to watching the Sopranos in less than 10 minutes. Also, the picture quality was vastly improved over HBO On Demand with my cable provider.Even if something goes wrong, I trust Amazon to replace, so I'm confident in this product.  Very happy."
"890","The Fire TV Stick was everything it was advertised to be.  I was able to plug it in right out of the box and had it up and running in minutes.  I have it plugged into a ""smart"" high definition TV that was not capable of handling Amazon Prime streaming video.  No Problem with the Fire Stick it come through bright and clear in Hi Def..  The only reason I gave  the Fire Stick 4 stars rather than 5 is the lack of directions for navigating through the maze of  apps and screens.  You are pretty much left on your own to figure it out.  Perhaps for a teenager it's second nature but for some of us ""baby boomers"" it's a little more difficult.  We could use a little more help."
"891","Nice product, only took a few minutes to set up. Install batteries, plug into HDMI port on back of your tv, type in your password for internet and your good to go. Couldn't be easier. Have only had a very few short times of delay when watching a show, but nothing to complain about."
"892","The stick works great. I got it to replace my chromecast that died on me a few months ago. I like that everything runs through the Fire TV Stick. The stick connects to the wifi and the apps can be downloaded into it. Easy to setup and download the apps. I take it with me everywhere and turns any TV into a smart tv with an HDMI cable hookup. Definitely something you want to get if you just want to watch Netflix on tv wherever you go (basically what I do with it)."
"893","I have 2 of these.  They both get used regularly.  I like the simplicity of the remote and if I have to log in on something I can use the app on my phone for the keyboard option.  This is a great way to turn a non smart tv into a smart tv for less than purchasing a smart tv."
"894","Worked as advertised right out the box. Easy to set up, Performance is snappy and consistent. Love being able to speak search params. Love that the remote is not IR and you don't have to be pointing right at the thing when controlling (I'm looking at you ATV)."
"895","Replaced all the Google Chromecasts in the house with these. Really regret getting the Chromecast because for a few bucks more you can get SO SO much more with the Fire stick. Having my parents replace their old Apple TVs with these as well. FSFTW (FIRE STICK FOR THE WIN)"
"896","I had a Roku stick that I ended up giving to my parents so I when I went to buy another stick, I decided to try out the Fire TV stick. I love it. The remote with built in Alexa is perfect for my laziness haha. I think it's awesome that I can just tell the remote to open Netflix (or whatever) so I do not have to search around for anything.  I believe having Amazon Prime really makes this stick even better.  Overall, it is just a cooler Roku, but being that they are around the same price, I would definitely suggest this."
"897","I Love it! Nice way to use the internet to get movies and sports. No more outrageous cable cost! Installation was supper easy - only 2 things to connect, connected to our Wi-Fi on its on, and found my Prime account and settings on it's own! Highly recommend"
"898","I've enjoyed this product with the Amazon programming. There's some very good original content provided by Amazon with emails to suggest programming that has fit my viewing desire in most cases. The voice command makes searching content much easier, the email suggestions make it even easier, since you can just speak the name of the movie into the remote and it takes you right to it. Especially if you're already a prime subscriber, this product pays for itself very quickly with real good original shows and movies that are direct from Amazon."
"899","We bought this about nine months ago and use it every day. I love that its simple enough that even my four year old can pull up her favorite shows by searching manually or using the voice feature. We do everything from watching shows on Prime, to using YouTube, or even listening to Pandora or Spotify. Love it!"
"900","I finally decided to cut back on some of my reliance on the satellite company and take full advantage of Amazon Prime Video that I've been paying for and hardly used.  So far, the Fire Stick have been great!  I'm still getting used to it but its fast with a great picture and I've been enjoying the extra TV viewing that I normally wouldn't have and coupled with an OTA antenna have been able to cut back my satellite package enough to pay for the Fire Stick.  I'm hoping to eventually eliminate the satellite completely.  I'm pleased enough that I ended up getting one for each TV in the house."
"901","Was soooo easy to install and get started with! I'm still learning it's tricks. Only tedious thing is logging into the apps using the remote to select the letters and numbers (unless there is another way I'm not aware of yet). And I have to learn how to communicate with Alexa. Really enjoy this."
"902","I honestly didn't expect much from this little streaming device but it absolutely exceeded my expectations.  It works flawlessly, has a user friendly interface that is pleasant, keeps a rock solid connection, and the remote of the highest quality.  Literally zero complaints."
"903","This fire stick has changed the way we watch our streaming services and we LOVE IT.. I can't say enough great things about the fire stick.Previously we had the computer hooked to the tv with an hdmi cord and had to access all our Amazon and Netflix shows by going through the computer screen.. The fire stick has given us a remote and a much better interface plus access to HBO and showtime and cinemax things I was not even aware were offering streaming services. Alexa is smart and intuitive and learns what you like quickly. The best part was that since I ordered the stick with my prime account it came all set for me and we just had to enter our worthless password.. This thing is AMAZING!!!!"
"904","Wow I love my new stick. My second one. Much better than the older one. So many features new home page looks spectacular. Much faster  My neighbors have invested in Amazon Prime got the stick and love it . I don't see them much now. They are inside all the time watching their TV"
"905","I got it as a gift and have not used it a lot, but it seems to work very well.  The Alexa voice feature more easily understands me than Windows 10 Cortana does.  The interface is quite easy to navigate and the very simple remote is elegant and utilitarian."
"906","Got it 2 weeks ago. I have 60Mbps from my ISP, so about 50%-75% of that over my WiFi. No buffering.  Easy installation of apps.  Great for HBO GO, YouTube, Twitch, Kodi, and amazing selection of Music.  The Alexa voice recognition feature makes everything easier."
"907","Love my Fire Sticks.  I bought two of them.  I've had both Roku and Apple TV in previous years.  The only downside I've found is occasional problems with remote stop working.  To ""reset"" the remote, remove the batteries and put them back in and/or hold the ""Home"" button down for about 20 seconds to reset.  Works like a charm."
"908","I'm in love with my new Amazon Fire Stick with Alexa voice control remote!!! This is the greatest invention, ever!!! I feel like it's straight out of Star Trek or something!!!Set up was so easy and then I was able to download and sign-in to the apps I use the most, like Netflix, YouTube, etc... also very easily. Then I was able to pull up movies, music and more by title, genres, etc... I was able to skip ahead and rewind in a movie just by telling Alexa how far to go. You can use the buttons on the remote too so you don't have to get Alexa to do it all. lolI can't ever go back to life before Amazon Fire TV Stick now, nor do I ever want to. I love this thing!!!"
"909","For 35 dollar it is a great way to connect my Netflix account and other free apps with my TV. Enjoying it very much. The device was having some problem after using for one month but Amazon customer service representative helped me troubleshoot in a few minutes and my Netflix was up and running again."
"910","I have been an AppleTV and Roku user for a long time.  These are great products so I am not trying to so anything negative but the FireTV is the leader in the class after trying so many.  I have a drawer of Roku devices now and will be switching everything to FireTV soon.  I already have two of them."
"911","I have an Echo and two Dots, so I'm a big fan of Alexa. As for the Alexa remote:Generally, fun and easy.  However, it isn't foolproof.  Most of the time, it does just as you ask. Sometimes,it gets confused (I know,  it's not human...however) and it leaves this dear old remote operator to figure it out.My granddaughters love it, so I'm glad I bought it. At this stage of its techno brain, though, don't buy it to replace your old Firestick."
"912","Love it !! Resolution is great. All the streaming sites I wanted (plus a few free ones I didn't know I wanted) are available & easy to switch from my computer to my TV. There's about a two second delay when tuning in to a site, but that was expected from watching the Fire Stick/Roku demos. Haven't had a single problem of any kind since I got it. I even like the Alexa Voice on the remote when I thought I never would. :) Would recommend this to anyone (and have)."
"913","I turned in my Charter Spectrum cable boxes today.  The same day I received my Charter Spectrum bill.  Had I kept my old service (cable box straight out of the cold war ...only record/watch 2 shows at a time) my charges were increasing by $32/month.  Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick was the best move I've ever made.  No monthly charges for the devices.  I can pick my own streaming services (such as Amazon Prime) and get the service I want ...not the service they want to give me."
"914","Seriously, the best $39.99 I have ever spent.  The firestick gives the Apple TV a run for its money. I have a smart TV but only get Netflix and Hulu on it.  With this stick you can access 1,000's of apps with different games, streaming services, and networks making it easy for the world to be at a click of a button.  Alexa also takes this divice to a whole new level. Every morning I ask her ""what's going on today,"" and she will give me a morning briefing discussing what's going on around the world. Alexa can also order you pizza for you and can turn on and off your smart home devices.  Like I said, this $39.99 gadget is an investment that you simply cannot pass up."
"915","I didn't want to buy a Fire TV stick as I truly love the Chromecast device BUT Amazon made it so that I couldn't access Amazon Video content from the Chromecast, so I bought their TV stick when on sale. I was initially annoyed I would have to keep track of a remote control (and deal with batteries ugh) BUT I have to admit that the Fire TV experience is quite enjoyable. I can still cast from apps on my phone, which I do occasionally but I mostly use the Fire TV interface to find new shows to watch and access all of my TV entertainment apps. For someone who didn't want to like it, I have to say that Amazon won me over with this stick and I would even recommmend it to others."
"916","Took a little while to get used to the operation, but it works very well.  I haven't used the Alexa remote as of yet. Am using the Firestick to access ""The Man In The High Castle"" - excellent drama!!  Am looking forward to other shows in the future."
"917","It did meet my expectations, just needs minor improvements, needs to be able to maintain a fast processing speed even after the device is heavily loaded with apps, I noticed the firestick began lagging after exhausting the memory or space on the device, had to return to factory defaults in order to remove the lag, where sometimes it would boot up and the main home screen would freeze intermittenly. Other then that the firestick is very reliable and does give a beautiful picture quality on all of the offered movies and apps that it provides. Very impressed. Would give it two thumbs up and would highly recommend it."
"918","Works great! Easy to set up and use. Eventually hope to ""cut the cord"" with satellite service. This device definitely makes that goal far more realistic. I really like the ability to move it to whatever TV I want to use - including if/when I travel!"
"919","I would give this 6 stars if I could. Easy to setup, great controls, good voice recognition, and even blue tooth compatible. Are you kidding me? When our Dish Anywhere App gets added, I will be in heaven. I could get rid of virtually all my Joeys, when that happens."
"920","I did not use it much, and I am not a smart-home owner, but for what it's worth, it has decent WiFi card so it connects to the internet well even under challenging conditions. It seems to work well for Netflix and DirecTVNow. I did not use it with anything else.The voice control of the remote is very accurate at least in my opinion, but the execution once the command is received has ridiculous holes. For example it is very smart in figuring out what weather information I want to see, but it cannot shut down the stick and the TV, it tries to find a smart device in my home (of which I do not have any)."
"921","My HD TV became a smart TV thanks to All-New Fire TV Stick. The only problem is that it only works at 720 p, because every time I change the image quality to 1080 p (the TV set  is 1080 p) it starts to flash and pixeling, pretty much annoying, forcing me to switch back to 720 p. Other than this, it is an amazing device."
"922","Nice! When using TV apps like DirecTV Now, slow tuning will occur. Not a Fire Stick issue mind you, just the nature of the digital beast....for now..If you get a USB FirePower power cable, you can eliminate the wall-wart power supply as the FS will receive power from the TV.. I just received mine, and it works. Dunno about if the FS remains powered up when the TV power is off....TBD...stay tuned...so to speak..."
"923","Works great so far and with minimal effort to setup and get running. Only had a problem when I used it without the power adapter that was provided in the package. I used it successfully a few times by powering it via the TV USB ports, but after a couple weeks it began going into an endless loop of ""optimizing system storage"" until I plugged it in with the Fire Stick power adapter. Magically it began working perfectly.Overall, I'm very happy with the Fire Stick's quick response to remote commands and especially the ability to connect my personal BLUETOOTH headset for private listening without requiring additional parts!Highly recommend this!"
"924","Loving my Prime membership more and more. I got the Firestick as a replacement for my Chromecast that gave way after being pulled out of hdmi ports one too many times. This works excellently and was super easy to set up. The only issue is that on a seemingly random basis it will completely reboot as I'm browsing shows to watch. There doesn't seem to be a correlation between which port I'm using,  outlet vs usb power, or just turned on vs running for hours. Inevitably, when it reboots once, it'll happen again within 30 seconds. Sometimes...even a third time. It's s minor inconvenience and only happens perhaps twice a week but that's the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5."
"925","Great replacement for my original FireTV stick from 2 years ago. I actually preordered it, and had it since October 20th, when it was available for regular order.The 2nd Gen FireTV stick IS NOTICEABLY quicker and a lot easier to deal with! No frustrating lag in response, Voice REmote is the best thing, especially now that it is powered with Alexa. Checking weather, traffic or telling it to play music from available streaming services is just the best..Seriously thinking about replacing my other FireTV stick with this newer generation one. Seems like amazon did their homework, as far as getting all the annoying kincks worked out of the new generation Fire stick. Love it!"
"926","The first 2 days it was glitching the whole time while watching NFL Sunday ticket. And we did a few  tests, and are positive it was not the internet or anything else. The third day we plugged a cable right underneath where the fire stick was, and because the fire stick is a little bulky, they were both tight in space... then IT DID NOT GLITCH ONCE!So, I think there's a flaw in the design, where it sort of dangles because is bulky, making it glitch."
"927","This is a great little item.  My five year old Panasonic Viera had a very limited range of apps, not including You Tube, and this little stick has dramatically broadened my choices.  The speech recognition works well and the connection speed it very good."
"928","So far this little device has opened up a whole new world for me. I love it; however, I am scoring it 4 stars instead of 5 just because the voice command quite often does not recognize what I am saying so I go straight to the keyboard and type in my search information."
"929","omg, amazing! My grown kids aren't techies but they got it up and running just fine. This stick will save them a lot of money and it was the best gift a mom could have gotten. We bought another product before hand and spent over 300. Needless to say I love theirs better. This is phenomenal."
"930","I love my fire stick. I have one in every room where there is a TV. We did away with cable tv and have saved a lot of money each month."
"931","Works well, when it works, but mine is having problems coming to life after being off overnight. Unfortunately, the warranty is only 90 days on this unit. Maybe mine is one of the few defective units but it is interesting that Amazon warrants many of their other devices for 1 year, but not this one."
"932","I absolutely love this! It basically does all what Alexa does without all the yelling. At times if I have Alexa at Vol 8 and try to change or stop the music. I'm literally screaming right above her. But it brings watching TV to a whole new level. Thoroughly enjoy watching movies, photos....with it. Love how I can just say reverse 10 secs, play songs by Train, what's the weather, my news briefing...It's just great!"
"933","I cannot describe how much better this Fire TV stick is compared to the first generation.  The first generation does not have near the horsepower necessary to run all of the apps that we use and seem to have wi-fi issues that cause it to drop/lose connectivity very easily.  I honestly should have sent them back when I first got them but now they will be relegated to the junk pile and/or our travel bag.  The new Fire TV stick also includes a voice remote which is also a nice bonus.  We have 8-10 Fire TV devices and with this latest version, I cannot tell the difference in performance/speed between the all-new stick using wi-fi and the boxes that are plugged into the wall."
"934","It's better than I expected. We have an older Apple TV but the fire stick is way faster and I love the fact that it has Alexa and the ability to download apps. Also, for all that it can do, you simply can not beat the price tag on this gem! My son talked it up after his father purchased one so for his birthday I got him one for our house (I think I'm more excited than he is about it lol!)"
"935","I am so happy with this product. It has made my small kitchen tv able to connect to Netflix and other subscription apps. Having this capability is enjoyable as I work in the kitchen cleaning or preparing food!Easy to set up and easy to use. Love it!"
"936","I love my fire stick!!! I can use it to log in and watch anything that I subscribe to using my dish network log on when I am not at home. I live in Oklahoma and our network TV feed is often bumped for weather coverage. I can use my fire stick to watch all of my shows on demand and never miss an episode.  I also watch my prime TV on it.  We love it!"
"937","Wonderful product. Just what I was looking for. Arrived promptly. Very easy to set up. Can get Netflix, Amazon,Hulu, and many other channels with excellent picture. Watch whatever you want when you want. Just tell Alexa what you want to watch and she will pull it right up. I love this stick. I also have a Roku but I like the Fire stick much better."
"938","We haven't had long, but sometimes the remote just stops working. Like it freezes up and we have to wait minutes for it to start again. Not sure what's up with that. Love the voice search option. Not as much to choose from on amazon prime as I assumed, but lots to rent."
"939","I love the fire stick! My daughter is the main user. She enjoys having the Disney, Amazon Video, and PBS apps. Cable is just obscenely expensive, so we cut down to basic and Internet and she still has the perks of seeing all her favorite shows and movies."
"940","Confusing at first. But I finally understood. Not unusual for me and technology! I haven't used it very much as it's with a TV on the sun porch. Still pretty cold for watching in a sun room in WI! I really don't appreciate Alexa and it would have been fine without ."
"941","I bought this product so I can watch “Amazon Prime” content only like I can using a Roku.It is impossible to eliminate all the useless icons and confusion. When the device is set to prevent accidental ordering of pay-for content, I have to undo this setting every time I want to watch free Amazon Prime content. While this gadget permits voice control, it is otherwise useless!What do you suggest????William Stuhler"
"942","All I can say, is get one!! You won’t regret it! I love my new FireStick!!! Now the Dot that came with it, I’m having a problem with. But I believe it’s just something I’m doing wrong. So I’m still getting that set up. But a definite 5 Stars on the FireStick :-)"
"943","I was spending $150/month for cable, internet and a DVR box. Now that bill is just $30/month. The Fire Stick pays for itself on day one!  I invested the savings in a years subscription to Amazon Prime. Now I'm saving money and have more control over what I watch. Already recommending this to my friends!"
"944","I don't know why I didn't buy this sooner.  My TV is from 2009 and had trouble accessing Amazon Video and Netflix using Blu-Ray players.  When I was able to get on, the picture was of substandard quality, even though the TV is capable of 1080p.After installing the Fire TV Stick and installing Netflix, I was surprised at how fast the videos load, and how good the picture looks!  My 5 year old had always trouble with remotes, but now he's able to select and play his favorite videos by himself.  We even had to turn on Parental Controls since he figured out how to purchase the Toy Story movies."
"945","Have purchased two of these. Some issues with connecting to the internet. Maybe my Internet carrier. Otherwise works great."
"946","Features are plentiful, but navigation is somewhat complicated at times with Alexas' responses not always what was asked for. The audible response every time the microphone button is pushed is very annoying. Personally, I'll stick with direct navigation and leave Alexa to my wife. For the price and portability I guess I shouldn't complain."
"947","I have a chromecast and for years it suited my needs.  I bought this on a whim, and found that the functionality far exceeds that of the chromecast.  I love this product, but wish there was a little less advertisement going on natively.  I'd gladly pay a little bit extra to avoid having adverts on my home screen."
"948","i'm a roku guy but needed to get something for a roommates tv who has no money so a friend talked me in to  a fire stick and i don't regret it at all great product if you need something for streaming this is it and it's cheap and works great just buy it."
"949","Very easy to use and works like a champ! Where we live there is no cable service and over the air signals are too fat away to receive. Our local internet is not the fastest but the Fire pulls on the signal and we can watch most anything we want that way."
"950","Love it, Love it, Love it!!!  I'll never go back to Cable TV again!  I'm saving $100/mo. by using my Amazon Fire Stick.  And the Voice Remote is awesome!  Was fairly easy to install (mind you, I'm not a genius with the modern technology and electronics)."
"951","I really like the fire stick. I'd have given it 5 stars BUT when using it I can't figure out how to tell which programming will cost me money to watch. I purchased it to take advantage of prime video included with my Prime account and so far I haven't been able to do that without going onto my computer to look up ""free with Prime"" content."
"952","This was a gift from my family and I really enjoy it.  Now I can watch Amazon Prime movies in my room and do not bother anyone. I also like the fact that I can get Netflix on the same device as all the other movies or TV series.  You get a wide variety of series, movies and games. I have only had it a couple of weeks but I have enjoyed it tremendously.  There is only one thing I don't like and it is the fact that if you don't already have something like HBO,  NETFLIX, or Amazon Prime you have to subscribe to them, which can get a little spendy, but I can say that it is cheaper through Fire Stick  than ordering from your local cable company or your local dish networks.."
"953","Super easy install. Up and running after inking through the prompts in less than 10min! Legit installed this when my cable was out, and I was watching TV within minutes! It had even preloaded all my saved shows and movies from my watchlist. (When I watched on iPad, etc)Need to knows* Must remain plugged in at all times. (Aka make sure you have an extra outlet behind your tv if mounted in the wall, and or space / place for a black chord)* Must have or setup amazon prime acct.* If your acct is set up prior to purchase, and used to buy, it comes already user ready! (Score)* Voice remote it clutch, remote is pretty basic without that function."
"954","I really like this item. However the OS is not as intuitive as the Apple TV. It's kind of clunky. But you are able to install Many apps such as TV channels in order to stream them as if watching from their websites. I.e. CWTV, HGTV, etc.Be aware. It does NOT have the built in capability to mirror iOS or Mac straight out of the box. But it will mirror android device screens. One addendum to that is that once you install the remote app on your iPhone an icon will appear on any YouTube video you watch that allows you to stream it to the tv.However, with a little research and a few extra apps and just a little tech know how, all of this is possible."
"955","Works great, it is truly amazing. It was extremely easy to install especially when you are not savvy with new technology. I bought Two and thinking about ordering other amazon electronics. I've been a amazon member for a long time and always had great service with my prime membership."
"956","I really like the fire stick but I have Spectrum for a cable provider and the stick as of yet has no Spectrum ap. My kindle fire tablet has an Spectrum ap. I hope they do soon I can get Spectrum mirroring the image from my tablet.  But it is a pain in the but so I mighthave to go back to my roku stick."
"957","LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE voice command feature, the variety of available channels and the ease of use.  I would give it 10 stars if possible.  It integrates with my Alexa and even the grandkids picked it up and started using it with very little instruction.  Great product."
"958","I bought this in hopes of turning my 'dumb' TV into a smart TV.  It is a total success!!  I now have all those smart apps that smart tvs have plus I can, and have, downloaded other apps.  My tv is a 720p set and no problems with the fire tv stick.  I highly recommend it!"
"959","I enjoy using the firestick for Netflix, Hulu & HBO Go. I've had problems with HBO Go working so that app is on & off. The Alexa Voice is a little fun but I've found that it's not to helpful with these apps. I think you need Amazon Prime to really enjoy the benefit. This firestick has more memory which I found my apps ran more smoothly (no hang up times in apps) now then vs the last one"
"960","This product would be worth $100. At $40, it's just incredible. The human factors behind the product is top notch. It does exactly what you expect of it without having to read the instructions.Amazon hit it out of the ballpark with this gem."
"961","Love my stick. Goes hand in hand with my cable provider and I am able to watch most tv shows without commercial interruptions.  Took it on vacation to Florida and only had limited regular TV but the fire stick kept me entertained throughout the heat and rain outside."
"962","My Fire TV stick is my NEW best friend...love it.  After talking to a few co-workers about it, I finally brought for a way to cut down on my cable bill from 3 boxes to just one.  I'm still learning about it but once I get the hang of it...bye, bye to my 2 additional boxes.  Just down load the apps to my favorite channels and I'm good to go."
"963","I thought the Fire TV Stick was too good to be true but I bought it anyway figuring once I found out what the catch was I could return it.  Guess what, there is NO catch!  I figured that I would have to pay some hidden fee somewhere, I couldn't be as simple as plugging it in to the TV and it would work, but it did!  As long as you have WiFi, it works immediately!  You can move it to whatever room you want and it instantly starts working again.  You can bring it to another house, hotel, wherever, and as long as there is WiFi it works!  The only thing that went 'wrong' was it appeared that I would have to pay for Netflix shows/movies even though I already have an account.  But after customer service calling me, they took off the 'block' and it worked fine.  And when I say they called me, they did.  I clicked 'call me' on the TV through Fire Stick and they called me withing seconds, literally.  I figured I had time to go to the bathroom but nope, the phone rang as soon as I stood up!  All in all, if you are debating about this, DON'T, just buy it!"
"964","What can you say about this great little unit that hasn't already been said. Compact, versatile, quick responding, easy to install (and modify, if you're into that.) We were an Apple TV family and we are now converting to Fire TV. We cut the cord years ago and used just our PS3s, then Roku and finally the ATV, but the Fire TV has probably been the most enjoyable and easiest to interface with the family. The price point of under $40 a TV doesn't hurt either."
"965","You won't live long enough to watch everything this has to offer . Incredible product !!  I fired my cable company . I get wifi for $ 25 a month and use a pair of rabbit ears for my local news and the Fire Stick for everything else . Only minor gripe is that when streaming live tv , it may pause for a moment to buffer from time to time , but that aside , this rocks the house !!  No more $ 160 a month cable bill with 200 channels I never watch anyway !! The voice remote is a nice touch but only works in the Amazon App. Still a great device !! Get one and FIRE the cable company  , you won't be sorry I assure you !! More music , tv shows and videos than you could imagine !! Genius !!"
"966","We have super slow internet so was very worried about using this. We've had some  hipcups but overall it's doing well. Kids love it. We play music and movies on it. Don't really use Alexa all that much. Usually it ask us to repeat what we said over and over again"
"967","Works with so many apps. We have had a good time listening to Amazon prime as well.  We were very surprised to find a screen reader option so that a person without vision can navigate the screen and apps. It works very well.  Didn’t expect accessible accommodations with an item that is at such a low price."
"968","I'm only giving this 3 stars for now because I haven't had it very long and thought THAT I only had to speak in the voice remote and ask for what I wanted to watch and it wouldautomatically show up and play and have live tv right there but I guess not or maybe I'm doing something wrong.I do like it some because it beats paying for high cable bills,hopefully I will be completely satisfied once I have had this product for a while,sure hope so"
"969","Generally speaking, yes.  However it would have been very helpful to have a diagram explaining the directions as they related to the markings  on the unit.  I am advanced in age,technologically impaired and could not understand the little diagrams on the face."
"970","I love that I can listen to all my music on here, and download apps onto it. I have not figured out the Alexa app just quite yet. Also, the remote/fire stick freeze sometimes and I have to wait a few minutes before I can use them agai, which can be frustrating. I would recommend this product for sure though. It is portable and even comes with a carrying case. Great for home, or travel."
"971","Wow! Next generation stick is awesome for bedrooms. Have a Fire TV box for the main living room and sticks for the bedrooms. Loaded Kodi and Playstation Vue onto them and got rid of expensive satellite TV and not missing a beat. Still have tons of entertainment and all the movies I could ever imagine. Stick is of course not as fast as the box with twice the RPM, but still runs well, and for only $40 you really can't beat it."
"972","Superior video quality through this device on my non 4G TV. Voice is easy to use. Only complaint is the menu layout is different from the menu used on the previous non voice model, which is sort of annoying that two devices have different menu layouts."
"973","I absolutely love my Fire Stick! It's a great addition to my video inputs, and if your receiver has a USB port, you probably won't even need to use the power adapter with it.Definitely worth the price, but keep an eye out for sales as well."
"974","Loooooooooove . can not say how amazing this item is. So easy too set up. So easy to use. Amazone is the the reason why I will never go too Apple. All my music, books, movies, everything stays with me. And the voice control is so convenient. Very happy"
"975","If I could give it 10 stars I would. Cut the cable, direct tv ,dish because this thing is awesome. I have already bought the second one . Easy to set up. Installing Kodi was simple ( you tube video ) and your're off and running . Buy it and save money."
"976","This is a great item.  Now we get the programs without having to pay the high prices of satellite TV.  The most difficult thing is for us old people learning to use everything it does.  Luckily we have younger people to show us what to do.  We are really enjoying this."
"977","I bought the unlocked firestick for my son to get free Netflix's, don't have cable just internet and it still wants me to log in for a free 30 day trial. My son is disabled and during the winter months TV is all he has. He we are on a fixed income and can't afford cable too. It works great except for getting anything free."
"978","Goodbye Roku. This Amazon girl has found her new BFF! No more spending $20 on Pay-Per-View in hotels. I bought this for a trip and it took me all of 5 minutes to set it up on the TV in my hotel. Works better at home than my Roku. Can't believe it took me so long to buy this!!!!!"
"979","The product is okay, but I just don't like the stalling and the stopping of a video or we have four fire sticks and at our home and if somebody decides they want to watch something the other person gets knocked off that's kind of irritating but it's better than cable. I was Upset when I wait for The Walking Dead to come on and to have the video and movie continue to stop because other people in household wanted to watch the same thing. On their Fire Sticks to If that can be fixed you guys will have something good.Thank you for your Allowing us to give a feedback With this fire stick I'm no longer even think about cable.  Sincerely yours the James family"
"980","I recently bought a Sony Smart tv on sale. Upon going through it's smart functions I found out that it wasn't so smart after all since the app selection for movie streaming were very limited. I needed something to play my Hulu and plex on this tv. So, I bought this bad boy and am amazed at how responsive and great it is. My roommate has a Samsung smart tv in his room and this amazonfire tv stick navigates and streams movies much faster. Plenty of apps for almost all types of streaming purposes. Startup is quick and I have never had a problem with playback. I use plex and i haven't had a problem with what ever movie files I throw at it. Overall this was a great buy!"
"981","Firestick is awesome.  I already had all the gizmos you can think of before picking up a Fire Stick, i.e. smart TVs, PC, next gen gaming consoles, Chromecast, you name it, I had it prior to purchasing the Fire Stick.  I purchased the Fire Stick mainly for Kodi because I heard many good things about this app.  Beyond supporting Kodi, Fire Stick also supports all the other wonderful apps, and does so in a small package that takes up no space at all.  Also the Fire Stick is super responsive and fast, and the remote is super handy.  I can control the Fire Stick with either the remote or a smart phone with the Fire Stick app installed.  Amazon did a great job with this."
"982","I got my fire stick a couple weeks ago. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars I s because I have issues with playing movies all the way through via wifi. I have to every once in a while (maybe 3 times a day) go to settings to forget the network and re-enter the info. I have the router in the same room as the fire stick so I am not sure what is going on. I will say it is a huge step up from my 8 year old blu ray that would take 45+ minutes to ""find the internet"" even though it was wired into the network."
"983","Pretty much love it, you can add all kinds of apps and watch pretty much anything. The only downfall is the typing feature, having to use the remote to type is a pain at times as it can take awhile to type everything. Other than that I watch everything from GOT to The Walking Dead. Nice Item to have!"
"984","My roommates has chromecast and that was what we used to watch Netflix and Hulu, but sometimes it wouldn't connect with our phone and it'd say error randomly. The only place we could watch tv was right next to our router, because it absolutely wouldn't work in our rooms. We figured it was just because we didn't have great wifi.My dad had the fire stick and he loved it, so my gf and I decided to try it out. IT IS AMAZING!! A million times better than chromecast. We use it in our bedroom tv with zero problem. Hasn't crashed or had issues with wifi! And the cool part is that we can also cast to it from our devices. I love it!"
"985","Great product and easier to use than Apple TV. Works out well for people that are already Amazon prime and want a way to watch addition TV options since Amazon has their own shows and movies as well as a huge collection of shows and movies to choose from."
"986","This little device has simplified our streaming experience and was easy to set up. The only things that are small issues:1. The batteries in the Alexa Remote do not last very long over all. I would recommend using two sets of rechargeable batteries to avoid draining too many AAA batteries.2. The remote can lose connection with the servers/Firestick a little more commonly than I would like. However, it just takes a few minutes and tries to reconnect.I'd also like an easier way to put the device to sleep than the device offers, but I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel for issues now. Buy it on sale, and these problems are worth the discount!"
"987","I have had great luck with it, I used the booster since I had read it wasn't as strong at Fire TV which I also have. I have two Samsung smart TVs and they don't pick up Wi-Fi as well as the Fire stick. Good value for $$$. Add to that I have some what iffy DSL but it soldiers on."
"988","no break in streaming and the voice remote is AWESOME!!!  When I searched Penny Dreadful, it brings you to either Netflix or Amazon and then one click selection and you are there....so much better then selecting the name letter by letter.  Never going back to manual keyboard selections.Note:  when we did first start..it was blurry for the first 10 seconds as it loaded the show...but then great resolution and it stayed caught up.I have a TIVO, which offers these same apps/access, but this is great for when you travel somewhere with wifi or when you don't want to have to scroll to each letter of the show you want to watch.  Worth the very reasonable price!!"
"989","So far (4 days, 7 or 8 shows plus some YOUTUBE browsing), I am thrilled with the Firestick with Alexa. No jitters. Good picture quality. FFWD and RWD. Voice commands. For an early review, I am very happy. Compared to a Sony DVD/Streaming machine this is LOADS better. I suspect due to the Sony device requiring access through the Sony website, THAT machine's preformance was severely hampered. Took that one back to the store I bought it from, rather than trying to hack my way around (as some suggest on web). I may re-review after some time, but for now, I am satisfied and completely enjoying this new use of my Amazon Prime content. I have yet to try Netflix, but just might re-up my subscription."
"990","So far so good! Had it about a month and like that it is hidden in the USB behind our tv that is wall mounted. Love the option to stream my amazon music playlist on it as well as the awesome screen savers that play if your show is paused for too long."
"991","Exceeded expectations, as a prime member the catalog of quality and original Amazon content at 1080p is an unbelievable addition. I also have a dish based satallite TV subscription, but the quality display on the Firestick is unmatched.Additional available streaming Apps such as Netflix, HBO now, Crackle etc makes this simple USB stick an unbelievably bargain below $40.Purchased with the Misson Cables USB power cable connected to my TVs 5V 500mA USB slot, negating the need to tether to power outlet."
"992","The one stop shop for your Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. I love it! I recently ditched my cable, and use this instead. I like that I can view the pictures and videos on my Amazon Cloud on my TV through this and that I can put parental controls on it so that no one can view them without a password. Also, I can listen to my Prime music playlists through this is well. I'm enjoying this so much that i bought one for my bedroom!"
"993","So I've had this product for about 2 weeks and I've got to say that I love it, it condenses everything into one place it makes it easy to find everything by simply saying what I want. In fact I liked it so much I bought a second one for a different TV I would definitely recommend this and it's super easy to use extra perk."
"994","This is better than the original. It has better WiFi connection speeds and a quicker processor. If you are going to do things other than streaming movies, I would suggest buying a an Android TV box. The firetv stick does not recognize other generic keypads."
"995","Works as you would expect it to work. Very fast and easy to use.My one MAJOR gripe is the lack of software volume control. Normally this isn't an issue, but when connected to an external speaker via Bluetooth it needs to be able to controll volume."
"996","Great product so far and a great price.  Easy to use and set up.  Programs offered were also enjoyable.  I have had apple tv (1st generation) for about four years which is also great but does not allow me to add apps. The fire stick does so both systems give me a great deal to choose from. I love being able to add both acorn tv and mhz. The Amazon original shows have been great and I look forward to more. The fire stick does get really warm if left in and hope this won't be a potential problem."
"997","Well worth the price. I don't have cable. It changed my TV into a smart TV. I no longer need to hook up my laptop via HDMI. I was surprised to find so many free news apps and such. Now I can make the most of my prime membership."
"998","The firestick has come in handy when I have bad weather since I have DirecTV.  It is very easy to operate,does not take up any room, and it has live video from cameras all over the world, including a 24/7 from outer space to earth.  Entertain people that come over for hours on end just from one menu to another.  The quality on almost everything is great.  Newer movies, tv series, etc is also very quick or even earlier then other sites who stream movies.  I'd recommend this to anyone as long as you have the internet speed to use it."
"999","I have to keep resetting it. And some of the channels are free. But for the most part you need to pay for the channels and the prime shows are not all free. More money and more money. And if you download a channel and go to watch.  You can only watch it for 10 min. Then you are told to buy this channel. I guess if you want to only pay for the channels you want to watch it is not that bad. Most start out at 7.99 month and give you 7 days for free or 30 days. I was happy at first........ until I found out most of the channels are not free. The only good thing about it is youtube app. And that is free.....One of the only thing that is."
"1000","This was  given as a gift.  Since I have a SmartTV and a PlayStation with many of the same features, I didn't think we would get much use out of this.  However, after letting this sit in a box for 5 months, I figured I would give it a try.  I could not be more pleased.  Being able to tie all the TV/Movie apps into 1 device, having a simple but effective remote, and the ease of ordering Amazon movies and TV shows...this makes the Fire TV Stick awesome.  Plus, using Alexa, you can ask her to look up the weather, sports scores, and more.  I could certainly see us buy one for our other TVs.  I am very pleased to have received this gift."
"1001","I have an older Fire TV Stick and the streaming on the newer Fire TV Stick is much better.  I have moved the old Fire TV Stick to my downstairs system so I can stream Amazon Music while working on the computer, even though I have a smart TV that sometimes doesn't seem so smart."
"1002","These work great and a a very fair price.  The second generation has a good processor and I never get any buffering.It is Android compatible, so you can load stuff from the Store.Update: I have now ordered 4 of these, one for a gift.  Replacing my Rokus."
"1003","I love my Fire Tv Stick! I mostly use it for kodi and it works great! I did end up losing the remote = [. I can't prove it but I know my cat stole and hid the remote somewhere around my house! It costs $29.99 for a new replacement remote. No thank you! Now I just use the fire tv app on my iPhone and that works great too!"
"1004","I have the original Fire TV Stick and bought this newer version so that I could have the older version for my workshop TV. This newer Fire TV stick requires the WiFi SSID to be broadcast, otherwise it will never connect. The older Fire TV stick seemed to work with hidden SSIDs without any problems.The new Alexa voice feature is nice but not mandatory. I didn't really notice the newer Fire TV stick working that much faster, but the 802.11ac is a welcome change to the WiFi protocols. I always had issues with the old Fire TV stick even with a dual-band system. In fact, with a single band 802.11n network, the old Fire TV stick never worked fast enough.Overall: 4/5 stars"
"1005","Haven't had any problems with my remote like some people say. Everything works fine and Alexa voice still works maybe some people just get those unlucky ones but I'm sure amazon will replace it or something if you call. Probably the best device out for watching new movies in theatre and all your favorite shows and movies you could think of in general. You can stream Payperview events and watch live TV along with All your favorite sport games. I can watch casting couch on a 60"" tv the things amazing. Obviously you need kodi for all this but I sell these things and make money too so it's overall great."
"1006","I really like this app. You really need to sign up for prime video/movies for the full effect of a great selection of movies and channels Prime I think cost.$90 or $99 a year. Prime also give you free shipping and qualifies you for same day delivery."
"1007","I have one tv that is not ""smart"". This is a perfect solution without buying a new TV just to stream.  Love it and the voice control....well I feel like a special person saying ""Prime Movies Please"".  This is great and so easy to use."
"1008","I like the Fire Stick. It is one of many streaming devices I own. I do wish Amazon would play nice with AppleTV and put the Amazon Video app on AppleTV. Having AppleTV did not stop me from getting a Fire Stick. People will buy whichever device they want. So keeping Amazon Video off of AppleTV will not make people not buy it too. I have several Rokus I use for Amazon Video. I got this device free because I tried DirectTV Now and prepaid a month of service. I'm staying with DirectTV in hopes of cutting the cord on Comcast. There's still some bugs, but not many.. I love Amazon the company and have been a customer since the beginning. Let's all play nice together.."
"1009","Got it! I'm a first time ""cord cutter"" and this has made the transition seamless. Easy setup, navigation, and superb HD quality. My only regret is not letting go of cable sooner. I have found enough content to satisfy my needs; including amazon prime video and bought an HD antenna for local over air channels (72 Channels!). If I ever crave cable, Sling-TV will do the trick. I'm saving $80 a month after 1.5 months of set up cost. Win-win."
"1010","It arrived right away, and miracle of miracles ... I was able to set it up right away with no fuss.  This is our first step away from cable, we have never had video games (well, on the TV), and the only thing we miss is being able to record our local news."
"1011","this is my second order for the firestick, i previously bought the one without the Alexa and gave it to my nieces and they absolutely loved it, then i decided to buy the Voice remote one for myself and now they want that one smh......This product is amazing you get a very wide variety of tv shows and lots of tv apps  to watch your favorite shows on, quality and quantity is amazing, if you wanna get rid of high cable bills then invest in one of these.  Those who is giving it a one star rating am not sure if we all talking about the same product though!!!"
"1012","The best thing about the Fire TV Stick is Kodi. Once Kodi is all the way blocked out, no one will buy these anymore. It will be back to Netflix. I love Kodi, not so much the Fire TV Stick it's self.... I honestly don't see why they want to block Kodi anyways..... People ""pay"" for everything that is on there with the subscriptions they already have and share it with others. That is like me paying for cable and not being aloud to have a friend over to watch a show with me.... Just saying, when Kodi is over this will no longer be a hot seller......"
"1013","I really do love it but I also wish that they would connect me to my google play store so I can get apps you have to pay for that I already paid for without paying again. Unless that is a feature of the more expensive versions than in the future I'll invest in one of those but overall I absolutely love this. I saw a review from someone else that really helped me decide between this and the roku and I so far believe from their review that they felt this was the better choice, maybe I'll try the roku as well to be of some help to someone else in deciding."
"1014","We love our Amazon fire sticks. We have bought two for us and two for friends. When we travel, we sometimes bring it with us. Also have Apple TV and roku and tried chromecast and this is our favorite. But big Amazon users, that might make a difference."
"1015","Great product and connectivity. Even at the furthest adjacent point in the house, I still have perfect connectivity to my 5 ghz network router. The Alexa voice function kind of sucks though. I say commands that the instructions suggest, and it messes up constantly. Good luck finding Band of Brothers, but everytime you'll get the Naked Brothers Band..."
"1016","Great thing for all your streaming services in one place!Plus you can have easily pack it around.If you can connect to WiFi and hdmi comparable tv (most hotel rooms and TVs sold nowadays have hdmi ports) you’re set!We take it everywhere"
"1017","We live in the country .  No cable available.  Netflix download and then play the program just fine.  HBO Go streams so downloads as it plays the program.  Constant spooling. Can't watch that.  When Verison goes into slow mode which is after 4-5 movies the quality of the picture is too sad for owning a good high def TV.  Also having a problem with the controller.  Sometimes it doesn't work but the batteries are fine.  Suspect it has to do with Direct TV timing out.  I took the fire stick up to the cottage with out hotspot and it was great to have Netflix there.  Will be able to use it in the camper too.  Streaming problems are due to Verison not the Firestick."
"1018","This product is amazing.  I live in a rural area but am lucky enough to have internet, we have tried different companies to get cable tv in our home but have been unable to do so because their is not enough signal.  With the Fire TV Stick connected to our internet we can finally enjoy programs such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime movies and many, many others.The setup was extremely easy and the operation is absolutely fantastic. Since day one of our install we have not had any issues and the picture and sound quality is beyond our expectations.  This is truly a life saver for those who want to have cable and cannot becausae of where you live or the price."
"1019","I love this. I haven't watched my cable box since I had this.  There's just so much to watch and play on this.  This is one amazing invention!!! Great job on this Amazon.  I love my firestick.  I highly recommend this product!!! My family has been asking me to order them one since I got this.  It makes a great surprise gift!!!"
"1020","Okay....so I LOVED IT. I have no issues with it once it's set up. The issue was the initial set up, I called a customer service number that was ""listed "" or posing as Amazon. Turned out to be a fraud issue (I reported to Amazon ). Despite that the clarity and options available are terrific,  this PAYS FOR ITSELF day 1!"
"1021","First one broke in a month.  Second one is two months old and already has issues.  Not worth the price for enhanced Alexa feature.  We love the concept, but it is not a quality product.  Fortunately, Amazon has replaced it for us, but we shouldn't have to keep doing this."
"1022","We love our firestick! It has all kinds of free apps you can download and use in replacement of cable. We were paying $160 a month for Comcast, but we opted to get an antenna and use the firestick instead.I only gave it 4 stars because our remote for the firestick stopped working after about 2 weeks. This doesn't allow us to use it, but I called Amazon and they were wonderful to deal with and are sending us a replacement for free! Great device for the price!"
"1023","The best deal going.  There are SO MANY TV shows, documentaries and movies of all genres.  Well worth the money.  I got rid of all but basic cable.  It is fabulous!  Took a bit to install, but understand others who got it after me say install was seamless."
"1024","I didn't find many ""free"" movies or channels with this unless a ""prime"" member, so you're kind of forced to be a prime member if you want to see any choice of movies at all.  The remote is easy to use, already a Netflix member, i was able to use this instead of watching on my mobile devices which made it easier. Very clear pictures and audio, but remember you should be a PRIME member in order to enjoy the services."
"1025","Remote does not work"
"1026","I purchased the Fire Stick as I was getting rid of cable and want to try the new Sling TV option (by the way, best decision I ever made). I had a Apple TV, and wanted to upgrade to the new model but the price tag was a deterrent, so I tried the Fire Stick. All in all it has been ok, my biggest complaint is with the freezing of the signal even with high speed Wifi. Sometimes it ok, but went it starts acting up, it really shows out. I never experience that with the Apple TV, but I think it's because it has a better processor to handle the bandwidth. But for the price of the Fire Stick, I satisfied. I have yet to explore the other features, when I do the rating may go to 5 stars"
"1027","I own several of Fire TV Sticks with voice remote, I use them to access my Amazon Prime TV, Amazon movies, Amazon music, ISY lighting controls, Tablo 4-Tuner Digital Video Recorder and PlayStation Vue. This product works great, well worth the money."
"1028","The Fire TV Stick posed no problems with setup and I was happily investigating movie listings when it stopped working.  We tried replacing the batteries and still it didn't work. Luckily, I was able to add the app for my phone and use it to continue looking around. Then I reviewed the instructions and read how to re-link the remote to the TV. I put the original batteries back in and held the home button for 10 seconds. No go. So I put the new batteries in, held the home button for 10 seconds, and was re-linked and on my way. So the less than perfect rating is because the Fire Stick was shipped with batteries that didn't last half an hour. Rather frustrating."
"1029","works perfectly! easy set up. easy to download apps. decided to go with the covenant app instead of kodi, due to they have a more stable app and offer current updates. i have yet to try the alexa voice feature, but will update the review when i do."
"1030","I bought an HDMI switch and decided to use the Firestick in that instead. So far, it's replaced my other equipment for Netflix and the Apple , other than itunes movies I was renting and purchasing. I might just be renting movies through Amazon now."
"1031","Really  enjoy the movies and Amazon original series available with the Fire Stick.  Great selection of shows, easy installation of device.  Purchased a second Fire Stick for bedroom TV so I can watch my shows when my husband watches his football/baseball games.  Thanks Amazon for another great item!!!"
"1032","My parents have had a fire TV stick for a while and I'm always using it so I finally broke down and bought one for myself. For the most part, I love it. However, it kept crashing A LOT. I googled the issue and found I wasn't alone with this. The culprit was that the adapter it comes with does not provide enough power. I switched to an Apple adapter (they provide double the wattage) and haven't had any issues since. I would have given 5 stars, if Amazon provided the properly needed power adapter. I love it other than that issue."
"1033","So far it has been good.  I have not used it too much since I received it  to give it an honest review.  A family member had it and thoroughly enjoys it many features.  I order this because of her.  There are a lot of things to view on tv using this device."
"1034","What a wonderful addition to our home entertainment at an incredible value! We cut the cord (from cable) at our house years ago and have become accustomed to using our PS3 to stream (Netflix, YouTube, etc) and using our Mohu leaf antenna to get free TV programming. We were frustrated for a bit with our PS3 apps (they never seem to work anymore) and considered investing in a smart TV (which ultimately took the back seat to more pressing priorities). However, we stumbled upon the fire stick and in an instant...our problems were solved! I bought two (one for my household and one as a gift) and we have rave reviews all around. Awesome product! Unbeatable Value!"
"1035","Fantastic product, but it has a lot more potential than what is currently available. I love that I can download whole lot of apps and skills. However, it gets slow after running the second app. You ask Alexa something, and then you have to wait over 10 seconds to hear the response. Everyday I go to its settings and kill all apps to make it back to speed. It can only search in Amazon stuff (no Netflix movies, no Spotify songs). Alexa is not compatible with the voice remote. It's also not sensitive to Alexa keyword. You need to hold a button on the remote when speaking (like Amazon Tap, unlike Echo). I think they could make this more clear in the description."
"1036","I got this to replace my old Apple TV.  I was tired of it getting stuck, and putting me back to the main menu while watching a movie.Installation was simple.  I did need to plug it into wall adapter.  The USB port on my TV doesn't supply enough power.  Being an Amazon Prime member it's nice to finally be able to watch Prime TV.  Everything has run smoothly so far, and the picture quality is excellent.Two issues.  I don't like the shape of the remote.  Because of the curved shape of the top and bottom.  When you grab it, it always twists in my hand.  Also, Alexa is useful but limited.  I don't think that's enough to loose a star over."
"1037","I have been looking for TV Entertainment that doesn't cost. You do need to be a Prime Member.  Fire Stick is Awesome.  I have so many selections to choose from.  And I use the music when I'm cleaning or getting ready for the day.  I have had it for just a short time and I'm very excited to have a day off to curl up and watch a movies or TV shows.  It was really easy to install..  (HDMI 2 on the tv).  I recommend this to anyone trying to cut their cost on a cable bill."
"1038","I have to say I love this tech toy. One thing to make sure you plan for is that the fire stick requires power via a provide power adapter.  Not a huge issue but it did require me to have to dismount and mount my TV to get access to power.The device works flawlessly. It was a great bargain with the free trials and $10 Amazon coupon."
"1039","Gosh I wish I'd gotten this sooner. I'm so pleased with playback and the available apps and movies I'm able to get. I even turned around and bought 2 more for my sons. The youngest of the two is enjoying his the best. He's a movie buff like his momma."
"1040","Love my fire stick, I finally cut the cord and while Fire Stick TV is limited in what it offers outside of apps. Searching is really easy. I wish they had more function in the remote to control the basic TV & receiver functions like on/off & volume."
"1041","Finally dropped Xfinity - paying too much for channels I never watch.  I would have given you 5 stars if there had been better instructions once I installed the Firestick. I spent almost an hour with a barely understandable rep learning how to locate Amazon Prime on the home page."
"1042","I'm very happy I bought the fire stick. I was hoping to see my iTunes movies on it but I don'tthink that's an option. I removed it from the TV that I had wanted iTunes on. I now have it on a tv outside and I could not be happier. I also have AppleTV on other sets.  Basically the fire stick is great when you don't have a smart TV.  I don't have cable on the outside TV and I'm truly enjoying watching movies there!!"
"1043","Love the Amazon Fire stick! It is a powerful tool to allow me to watch Youtube, Amazon Prime and Netflix to my hearts content.I have two Amazon Fire TV boxes, three fire sticks for various rooms in the house and it makes a fun and affordable gift for friends and family."
"1044","I'm giving the firestick a 4 because while it works, it was more difficult to set up than expected. My TV is older, but I kept getting the ""input not compatible"" popup. I had to use a different tv to change the settings on the firestick to make it compatible to my tv. It has since made me do that one more time after initial setup. This was also not discussed in the instruction manual, if 2 pages of pictures can be considered that. Other than that, it works fine. I also wish it was setup with categories or a separation of what you can watch for free vs. what you have to pay for. I hate clicking on something thinking it's through prime when it's not."
"1045","The Fire TV Stick is everything it advertises itself to be. It is beautifully configured and seamless in what it delivers! I have never enjoyed watching TV as much as I do now!"
"1046","We wanted to dump our satellite dish. We signed up with DirecTVNow. Since we're already Prime members, it was logical to use the Fire TV Stick. It's been great! No issues at all. Easy to plug in and get going. One of the best decisions we've made."
"1047","The Fire TV Stick is an ideal accessory to your TV. I wish I honestly would have purchased one much earlier. Since I've told my family about them, I've since bought one for my mom, dad, & sister. Being able to view not only free channels/shows periodically, but being able to view YouTube & Netflix for the Fire stick is a huge plus!"
"1048","I love my  firestick. I bought one for each of my tv's. I loaded Kodi to them all and have lots of options now. I got rid of a few cable boxes too so saving money there. Just YouTube how to do it yourself."
"1049","Working great.  I considered getting the full blown fire TV but this has plenty of function for me."
"1050","Great has plex Tv and many other apps.  But it does NOT have a Kodi app. Update: apparently mine came with the new update that doesn't let yet get Kodi from the App Store. You have jailbreak it to install. You will need to download the ES downloader app. I searched YouTube and found a way to install KODI. After following the YouTube directions I now have Kodi on my this newest Firestick no matter what updates it came with."
"1051","I Am truly enjoying this unit. The streaming is great with no interruptions so far. I bought early January and I haven't been able to stay away from it . Amazon video and Netflix are superb quality with it. The unit , of course , offers access to almost everything about streaming tv shows  and movies. I don't need hbo neither other medias although I have them available now with fire stick. Alexa works great, even better than I expected. The remote's size is perfect and easy to use. Anyone can use it. The user experience and interphase or navigation shown on my tv is great . My tv is a two year old  LG and all you need is the hdmi port . Thumbs up Amazon!!"
"1052","I'm using for a 2 weeks and work very well the problem is that I'm using in Peru so the amazon account not working here only some series we can watch it, so in that case I install some APPS that permit to watch Peruvian TVs online and use my Netflix account to watch movies and series I use other APPs that install in manual aplications, with this details I use my TV or in other case in a Pc Monitor I use it with external converter to amplify the sound and work fine. The Alexa remote only work with amazon products so i can not use it so much. I install an APP to remote control with My Ipad and is more easy to use it for type text. In general Work very well."
"1053","arrived on time and its a nice little feature to have but I hate that it takes so, so long to load up a movie or show.  But the picture is great, sounds great, everything about the stick itself is wonderful!  Gave it a 4 because it's so freaking s-l-o-w to load."
"1054","This item is awesome I bought two of these fire sticks one for my daughter and myself and I am going to tell all of my friends and family members about them also it was very easy to use and set up, good bye cable TV and thank you amazon for such a great product."
"1055","It is the best purchase I gave ever made.  I have paid cable bills for 21 years.  It was easy to install.  I still have internet via my local company.!!  The amout of entertainment cannot be matched.  I have only gad the Fire TV for a vouple days."
"1056","No surprise that it's ""Amazon forward""; meaning that the suggested content leans heavily towards Amazon productions.It's often slow to respond, ""Alexa"" is limited, and it often has a hard time smoothly streaming content even though other devices in the same room have no problem.With that said, if you don't have a ""smart TV"" - or other similar device - for the price, it's not terrible. If you're looking for something similar you'll be spending much more money.It's not my ""go-to"" device for streaming, but it's certainly second on the list."
"1057","I was reluctant at first, envisioning this tool to be too ""techy"" for me but it's very easy to navigate through Apps, packages and channels.  It was worth replacing my cable TV package (minus internet) for this, it's amazing to be able to watch uninterrupted TV shows and movies.  My husband is enjoying his Spanish channels and sports.  The Alexa Voice Remote is a plus, again... very user friendly (I'm old school).  If you're looking to lower your monthly cable bill and still enjoy watching TV PLUS more... put your mind at ease, this is the way to go.  I'm super satisfied with this purchase."
"1058","Small remote control and you only have to plug it to HDMI which is pretty cool and it's always out of the way easy installation that's really no problem for those that don't want to use Alexa there's also a remote control with a keyboard but it's made by a third-party I do recommend this device"
"1059","This was for a second TV as I had one already installed on a TV and did not want to keep changing back and forth.  I am very happy with it, The installation was a breeze and much faster to install then I thought it would be.  I highly recommend this product and Amazon.  Pat"
"1060","Amazing, tied for best voice recognition with Google's. Anything you can't find on the Fire Stick is found by just searching with your voice with Alexa. Definitely on par with Apple TV if not better, smooth, fast, and satisfying. The only improvement that could be made is have a dedicated Amazon Prime section where only the free Movies/TV (that come with Prime) is displayed (basically like Netflix except Amazon Prime)"
"1061","I purchased the 1st generation fire tv several years ago. Very happy with it. We recently ditched cable TV due to the outrageous price and replaced it with the fire stick. It took 5 minutes to set up and works perfectly. My only issue was opening the battery cover."
"1062","The Fire TV Stick has added a whole new dimension of how we watch TV. We've been pretty traditional tv viewers. Love the Stick and how we can take it with us in our RV. RV parks don't always have the best reception or cable options. All we need to do is access the internet and we can control what we watch."
"1063","This little guy is amazing. Perfect for streaming all your favorite shows and movies. Very easy UI and smooth interface, remote is sleek. I haven't used voice on the remote so I can't comment on that. But I love how easy it is to use the Firestick."
"1064","This is soooo much better than having to pay for cable.  I just wish i had a way to get some free channels.  but i listen to my gospel music and i have exercises on there for the morning and i found books for my grandkids to listen too so its so much worth it."
"1065","I had apple tv for years but recently got the fire stick and I love it.  Way better for a lot less!"
"1066","I absolutely love my Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote.  My dvd player was giving me a lot of problems and when my grandkids gave me the unit my problems were solved.  You just ask to play your amazon videos or Netflix and you are good to go."
"1067","Love it!  Easier to use than my so-called smart TV.  Get Netflix, Amazon Prime videos, Hulu and the rest.  Very easy to upload those apps.  It gives AppleTV a run for the money with more features.  And I can't see Amazon Primes videos on AppleTV."
"1068","Love this firestick! Bought some as gifts for the family and they loved them! If you Netflix and Amazon prime it makes it so much easier to watch on your TV! We have a TV that ain't a smart TV so this really allowed us to watch our shows on tv!!!"
"1069","This is my third Fire TV Stick. Now all m TV's have one! I love it. It is so easy to set up and a breeze to operate. I love the Alexa remote. Amazon Prime is great! I hardly ever listen to Pandora or Spotify any more. It is so easy to ask Alexa to play whatever genre music I am in the mood for, Even ""Carolina beach music""."
"1070","I have had 5 Roku's over the years and have been extremely satisfied but suddenly I'm like ...What's Roku?  Set up of my fire stick was a breeze and I love the Alexa feature. My only complaint was with the black packaging and black components I overlooked some of the pieces in the box at first."
"1071","We have both the Roku and the Amazon Fire stick and have compared extensively over almost a year now.  We think the Alexxa feature is great but the Amazon Fire Stick has so many limitations we prefer the Roku by a large margin.First - The interface.  We find the homepage easily misleading because you are always tempted to use the arrow keys to the right but it starts at the topmost menu and you think it is starting lower down.  You think this because the top menu tends to be in a smaller viewing field and the main thing on the screen are Amazon highlights.  They should have the topmost menu bigger and also have a lot more size / contrast for the highlighted selection.  When we pause things like Plex, the unit will return to the main menu if the screensaver kicks in and we have to drill down multiple levels just to return to what we were watching which is a really annoying.  Both devices offer using your phone as an alternate remote which is handy and helps a lot when you either cannot find your remote or the batteries have died.Second - Apps.  Apps like the CW only list about a third of the shows that show up on the Roku and there is no option to sign in on many of them like you can on the Roku.  The more you limit the apps and try to push people to the Amazon the more the Roku will appeal to consumers.  The choices amongst apps is much more limited compared to the Roku and seem driven by demand instead of supply since they might contend with Amazon content delivery and so it is this conflict which I see driving lots of decisions behind the creation and management of this device.Third - convenience.  I would say this and the Roku are both highly comparable as easily portable.  It is very easy to grab the stick, the cord and the remote and travel anywhere.Fourth - Playback.  With regards to playback it does a good job but is not as good as our Roku which is six months older.  The fire stick often complains that it is unable to playback at full resolution (1080) either due to connection or transcoding issues from Plex but the Roku never has that problem.  I believe the Roku has a larger memory or a larger portion set aside as a buffer and that compensates as well as the other variables like processor speed, architecture, etc.  Bottom line - the Roku plays without issue and the Amazon Fire Stick has issues with playback.  Another issue with playback are the control options.  Subtitles cannot be adjusted for timing and this is a very big issue since some apps download subs separately and need the ability to adjust the timing to match the flick.  This is a major flaw or shortcoming for the Plex app within the Amazon Fire series.Overall, we have enjoyed this Amazon Fire Stick but the Roku is simply better on many fronts especially the number of applications, signing in to specific applications, playback, and the general interface."
"1072","It is good ""if"" you don't have a new smart TV other then that I really don't see the ""need"" in it? I returned it because I can get a lot from my TV's that gives me that already. You have to ""buy"" a lot of  ""apps"" along with it."
"1073","I've gone through the entire Roku series since it was first announced. When I saw Firestick at less than half the price I had to try it.WOW! Firestick with Alexa is far more versatile, a little more technically involved, and a lot more fun."
"1074","I was very pleased with the Fire Stick. . . I didn't purchase through Amazonprime - I purchased through QVC.  The stick was easy to setup and use.  I bought it for my guest room and I am thinking about buy for other rooms.  I refuse to buy another cablebox from Service electric and I purchased this instead.I just wish that Amazon would go into the cable business maybe then cable would not be so expensive."
"1075","Bought this for my parents on cyber monday on sale- gave it to them this Xmas. Instillation was super easy- just plug into your tv and a power supply. Logging into their Amazon account, and later netflix and hbo accounts was also easy, and they absolutely loved using the voice activated remote to play music or watch a show or movie. Truly a fantastic device. Runs really quick and just worked with no issues. Frankly, it worked better and was easier to setup than my current Chromecast (which i'll admit is now over a year old...)Great device, really affordable and I'd absolutely consider it as a replacement if my current Chromecast ever dies..."
"1076","We got rid of dish and now have subscriptions for Netflix and Playstation Vue. I ordered the Fire TV Stick to use these streaming services in our bedroom. I'm very happy with its performance. It was easy to set up and it works great. I love how small and discreet it is.  I ultimately chose this over the Roku stick because of the voice controls. This makes finding what I want literally as easy as saying what I want. The only downside is that sometimes it's a little slow when browsing through titles. I would recommend this for a TV that only gets casual use, such as in a bedroom. The Fire TV (not the stick) would be a much better option for a family room."
"1077","Its a great device.  I have 6 tvs in my house and not all smart tvs.  when cable companies decided to scramble the signal so you would have to pay monthly for a box for every tv.  I just bought firesticks so now every tv is a smart tv"
"1078","My Amazon Fire stick arrived with my Amazon Prime within a few days of placing the order. I love my Fire Stick. I can see my movies, Music, You- Tube, etc. Installation is very easy. I have NOT done the jailbrake. I'm debating whether to do that or not. But overall I love this product. It saved me from buying a 'smart TV'."
"1079","Its a good device but the wifi connection is pretty bad, i run 100mbs but the stick will freeze up if i even look at my phone. I ordered the net cable adapter that comes out in nov and will try that but if it still freezes then i would pass until their new fire box comes out which is only $20 more than the stick and its 4k"
"1080","I personally like this a lot more than the Apple TV (which was replaced by this).  The interface is nice and simple, and I love how well the other Amazon services (music unlimited and audible, specifically) are nicely integrated with the Alexa voice functionality.  Never going back to Apple after using this bad boy!"
"1081","Great, and very simple to use. I had Comcast stick and fought having to purchase yet another device to watch Amazon Prime but I got a $10 off at Staples and they allowed me to use it on my Fire Stick so I bought it. I'm glad I did, so nice to use one remote for everything."
"1082","I am enjoying it.  And having it in the living room enabled me to put my older Roku on a TV in a guest room that doesn't have cable.  It makes it possible to watch Amazon and Netflix programs there, and listen to Pandora.  So I am pleased all around."
"1083","I absolutely love it. It syncs right away with my prime account. It is super easy to use. I m recommending this to aloof my friends. Also I cut my cable bill significantly."
"1084","Streams as well as my expensive roku boxes. The only thing I see that needs improvement is the battery cover. I was so frustrated trying to remove it to install the batteries that I almost returned it. This was my first fire stick purchase but I have 5 roku boxes. I am very impressed and pleased with everything I am able to do with the fire stick and Alexa Voice has been very helpful for my husband who struggles with electronics. I will definitely buy again."
"1085","This is a very good product that works as claimed. After signing up for Netflix and already having Amazon Prime the TV shows and movies available should keep me busy for years! I'm ordering another Fire Stick for my lady friend so she won""t steal mine! She likes it too. I felt bad disconnecting it from her TV and bringing it back home so I ordered one for her. Wish it would get here quicker though."
"1086","We have been using this for over a week and It has exceeded our expectations. We see no reason for us to subscribe to paid TV."
"1087","Absolutely love my Fire stick!!! Slightly bigger than the standard USB stick; plugs directly into a smart tv. The Fire stick comes with a wall charger and remote. [For our Vizio] If you press the home button on the remote it auto turns on your TV and the Fire stick. You can access Amazon prime shows / movies and can add apps like Netflix or Hulu."
"1088","My 5-year old Roku was acting hinky so I decided to replace it.  Chose the Fire Stick since it is Echo compatible never dreaming that it wouldn't stream my Vudu videos.  Every other device I own streams Vudu.  What's the deal, Amazon?  My rating will stay at 3 stars, which means acceptable but nothing special, until Amazon finds a way to add Vudu to the Fire Stick apps.  According to Reddit, there is a side-loadable app for Vudu, which is the only reason I'm not returning this item."
"1089","Originally had Apple TV, this device is compact, more variety of apps/programs to choose from and a hell of a lot less than most other streaming sticks.  Well worth the money!  I plan on getting a few more for the other TVs we have in our house."
"1090","5 STARS! Amazing PRICE, Amazing PERFORMANCE, Amazing GRAPHICS. Need not say more, BUY, BUY, BUY!"
"1091","Its a great product. I returned it though because I just did not use it. I originally wanted it for Kobi and the addons and plug ins for free movies but that aspect of it kept crashing. I downloaded Genesis, Exodus etc bjt kept crashing. The Fire Stick itself offers lots of things especially if your an Amazon prime member. But for what I personally wanted it for, (kodi/plugins/movies) it didnt reach my expectations in that aspect."
"1092","I dropped my Chromecast for Firestick and am sooooo much happier!  Also I am very pleased with how well the voice remote works.I feel I need a backup remote, I am so happy with this I am ready to finally cut the (ridiculously overpriced) cable cord and buy a few things a la carte, I will save at least $100 a month, especially with family prime account (you still need to buy the a la cartes individually  WORTH IT.)  If I lost my remote I would freak out!  But that's just forgetful me.I love the Prime video, I am surprised how much I watch, that I never took advantage of the years I have had Prime.  What a waste I missed so much."
"1093","I Love It.  I plan on getting 2 more.  One for my Mom and one for my Grandparents.  Beats Xfinity Contract, and saves alot of money in the long run.  We don't watch TV that often and when we do it is only specific TV shows or movies, so it was worth it for us to save money in the long run with The Fire TV Stick than wasting money on a $ 60.00 + (minimum) cable bundle from Comcast/Xfinity every month.  Thanks Amazon."
"1094","I have ROKU and I just bought The Fire TV Stick. It does almost everything ROKU does, BUT the Fire Stick has Alexa. This device works very well with Amazon Prime."
"1095","This is our second stick.My wife uses Alexa voice search like it was a friend.Good job Amazon.."
"1096","The fire TV Stick was so easy to install and such fun to use.  I treasure the pictures uploaded from my computer to Prime Photos, taking us back more than 50 years.  The stick does many things, but bring back memories is beyond what I had expected."
"1097","My use is pretty one-dimensional so far. I don't use the voice command, and I keep it on Netflix, but it makes a very nice Netflix device."
"1098","I've only had this about week but I love it.  I had a Roku which I really like but with theFirestick there are ton's more options. Alex is awesome too.  The price makes it very affordable so I'm going to get this for my other TV's as well."
"1099","Maybe the best media streaming ""box"" available today.  There are only two things that I can't do with the FireStick: 1. play a DVD and 2. access iTunes and my media library.  Otherwise, you can't beat it.  And the price is pretty nice too."
"1100","I have been using this fire stick for a couple of weeks and I love it. The Alexa voice command is great and the slim remote fits great in my hand. This compact streamer is small but mighty and easy to use, again I am enjoying the Fire Tv Stick."
"1101","Make sure you get the latest version as its snappier. Don't pay for jailbroken ones as it's a very easy to install Kodi and there is no need for a jailbreak. Its just sideloading. I hope the next model has more memory for apps a fast CPU and 4k"
"1102","This is very nice to have. My daughter installed it quick for me and I was good to go. Unfortunately I bought the fire stick from someone who had installed a program called Legacy. Well someone stoled it and all the fire stick he had sold had to be reprogrammed that was a pain in the ads but I did it. Had to get a new password and download all my movies and TV shows back on the fire stick. Oh boy I still haven't reinstalled all my previous library shows but I still like the fire stick."
"1103","This makes watching streaming videos, movies and TV shows so easy.  My streaming Prime videos were constantly breaking up...something between Prime and Vizio TVs.  With the Fire Stick, no more break ups, or stops, or ""lost connections""."
"1104","Fantastic product at a great price!  Given the problems I'd had with a first generation Apple TV module I didn't have high hopes for this gadget, but wow was I surprised!  Easy setup, ability to use cell phones and Ipads for control only add to the great assets this module enjoys."
"1105","It's getting better than the first generation but it still needs more RAM overall I have to say though that I liked it Alexa can be glitchy and not perfect I may have to repeat my request several times but overall I can say that I generally like it for its price point"
"1106","I`m completely satisfied with the fire stick so far.  I`m still in the learning stage with it.  It was easy to hook up and I`ve been able to find the things I`m interested in pretty easily. ( I`m 83, so for me, everything is a challenge.)  If it holds up and stays trouble free I`ll be happy."
"1107","I love my fire stick. I bought one and it was so easy to use that I bought another one for my TV upstairs. I can watch a lot of different shows. I do not use the voice remote but I do use the remote itself manually. Easy to program. LOVE THEM!"
"1108","I was frustrated with the original control without voice. Got so po'd that I just stopped using it or trying. With the voice control it seems to work just fine. So far I love it. Will test it again tonight looking for a Chinese film I want to see again."
"1109","Wow, how EASY for me to install (66 years old, kinda' sorta' computer savvy, smart TVs however, are another thing).  In all seriousness, this is a great buy and I've enjoyed the portability of it.  I've used it in 2 different rooms.  I highly recommend."
"1110","I have only had this for a day and only used it once but I love it! The interface is smooth the remote doesn't feel cheap like the apple tv. I bought this for one app and one app only but am using it for so much more already. Also you can hook up most Bluetooth gaming controllers does not have to be the amazon one>"
"1111","I really enjoy the fire TV stick. I gave it 4 stars because it took me an hour to get the back off to install the batteries. I don't dare close the back completely shut. Good thing I didn't because 1 week later I had to put in new batteries because the remote stopped working."
"1112","After several tech support conversations (not all related to the fire TV stick remote), everything worked well. I will say that the intuitive operation of the fire TV stick is not very user friendly. Also, the user manual has to be downloaded and printed. I have yet to use the Alexa feature. Tip: If you are using this with a Slingbox, be sure to download the correct APP e.g. Slingplayer NOT Slingtv!"
"1113","It's a great device. However, this is the third fire stick I have bought in a year because since it overheats so easily I would have to open it up to help it a little and this caused the charging port to break off twice. This one seems to deal with overheating well.One thing that is irking me so much is that I can't calibrate it to my TV. I have a fairly old TV for which I use it and apparently the screen is not good enough for the stick because the tips of the arrows are cut off. This is is really bothering me because in the old model I could calibrate it. It is really annoying that a fraction of the content I'm trying to view is cut off. Can you please fix it?"
"1114","This seems to be a new generation of the Fire TV stick. We purchased one about two years ago (the non-voice remote one) and this one is heads and shoulders above that one. The speed of the firestick's loading, etc. is fantastic and we're really enjoying having this one."
"1115","What an incredible device that opens up a whole new world. So easy to use and portable too. Great price and opens you up to thousands of movies music and more!  We live in a wonderful age.  I am so glad my sister told me about this incredible device. Could not be simpler to use. Love it!"
"1116","Was looking for a new Chromecast since my old one doesnt seem to work with the new updates. Apple TV is good but I hate that silly little remote that always gets lost in the couch. This is the best of the 3 in my opinion and I think I got it for like $30."
"1117","This is by far the best value for money in streaming sticks. It allows easy access to install custom Android apps via ADB. Bye bye Roku.Alexa remote works flawlessly. I control lights and all my Zwave devices from the remote. No need for Echo."
"1118","My Fire stick works good. The installation was very easy. You must subscribe to Amazon prime in order to watch movies & to have free shipping as well.It is well worth worth it. I can now return my cable box and save $10.00 per month. We plan on purchasing a second fire stick for another tv."
"1119","Works great and was easy to setup and sync with my Fire Stick earlier version and all the apps that I have. Just would rather not have the voice and pay and extra price for Alexa($10).  Do not have it on my other stick and do fine without it."
"1120","Just got around to installing and using it after having it for 2 weeks. Easier than expected to install & use. There is a lot to see & try. I am not a big TV user butane we have a Prime account, smart  TV and wireless Internet, (RCN does not support Amazon Prime movie yet so with the firestick you can  get prime content and much more if you want to spend the money for the memberships to HBO Now, Hulu, Sling, etc. etc). I am not junkie on having the latest technology. This is easy and makes your TV much more valuable. We have watched 2 movies and none of the buffering I was expecting, and there were two using the internet besides the movie playing."
"1121","Ordering the Fire Stick brought me to the realization that my router was too slow to operate properly.I have been sent a new router, but now I need a technician to come in to install it as it is much more complicated than the old one.I don't yet fully understand what I can watch without paying an additional fee, but I will work on that after the new router is installed.I do like the Alexa Voice feature.  When I don't know what to do I have asked Alexa for help."
"1122","The Firestick itself is easy to use when it wants to. I can control the Firestick with my Samsung smart remote and it won't allow me to revert to original remote. Netflix and Firestick do not get along either. I don't know how to describe the errors with Netflix, but it works find with Hulu and Vudu."
"1123","This was a gift. I am really enjoying this Fire TV Stick........specially all the movies it has. Just having this for a short time I have only experience looking at all the great movies that it has. I love what I have seen so far with this remote."
"1124","Having three Rokus in the house, I opted this time to purchase the FIve TV stick to test this alternative.Because it is so very Amazon centric, I find that I prefer the Roku system.Other than that, this does what it sets out to do."
"1125","It's super!  There are so many free movies which is what I wanted.  I have a small TV set up in my kitchen and love to watch ""clean"" romance movies while I work in there.  I was previously buying DVDs which have piled up.  This is so much simpler and is free except for the Prime price which really pays for things other than the Fire TV Stick.  I'm not very ""electronically literate,"" but I'm sure I'll find many other things to do once I have time to read about all the good stuff.  I would certainly recommend it! I would say that it's a bit difficult to figure out how everything works, so I would recommend reading the material first!!!"
"1126","Great product, it has exceeded my expectations so far, my one disappointment is that it isn't self powered (It plugged into power source, usb port on the tv or power outlet). No buffering issues and it is very responsive, very little to no delay."
"1127","Just cancelled Directv. Prime member, netflix, and other apps are still cheaper than the dish or cable services.You can get Kodi on the new model with Alexa Voice. If you're having trouble chances are you're doing it wrong.Yeah its 1GB ram, but its more than enough to stream. I do not suggest downloading games to save on memory.It's very simple to use, and easy navigation. You cannot get the flixter app, but with miracast, you can mirror your phone.Well worth every penny."
"1128","This is hands down the BEST media streaming device there is. A bigger HDD, like maybe 30GB and a bigger, better memory/RAM and it would be super fast and amazing. The interface can be slow sometimes; clearing your cache can help a lot. But a bigger better hardware spec would fix that big time. Obviously KODI is amazing as well but I stream Netflix and Hulu and Amazon Prime movies and music on it and haven't went back to my PS4 since I got it and figured it all out."
"1129","Oh my goodness!! I don't think I can find anything negative to say about this product. I have this, along with Netflix and between them, my viewing choices are endless! I can still watch some of my favorite programs using apps available on the Fire TV Stick such as the ones for Food Network, NBC, A&E, and many more! I'm discovering options via my Prime Membership all because of the purchase of my Fire TV Stick. It is so simple to set up and to use. I cannot come up with enough adjectives to describe how satisfied I am!"
"1130","We find ourselves watching more and more with the Fire TV Stick. The picture quality seems much better than the regular HD cable. We have not signed up for any of them premium channels since we have cable. We do enjoy this. When we travel in our RV we will take this with us and hook it up to the tv."
"1131","I like my Amazon fire stick, but I don't get the channels I really want to see on Amazon, like my local channels. Example; KSBW Action News 8 and the  free channels you provide. I need to enter a code, but my tv provider is not displayed on the list you ask us to enter a code at in order to watch, which is called, ""Charter/Spectrum"""
"1132","I have the Fire TV box in the living room and love it. I especially love the Prime music and iheart radio app. I bought a new smart TV thinking the Amazon app would be on it (Proscan T V). It was not. So I decided to try the Firestick. I was nervous thinking it might not pick up my wifi that is three rooms away. Well it comes in beautifully. It is very responsive with no lag. That is for what I want to do - watch Prime Movies and listen to music. It works as well as the Fire TV. Amazing. Keep up the good work Amazon. Only tip - if TV doesn't recognize the remote, turn on the smart TV feature and then exit and try again. That kicked it in for me."
"1133","The voice remote is much better than my previous controller. However, a future design could address the N/S/E/W sensitivity to the center button, which can cause a mistaken center button push. Not a big problem, but something that could improve the unit."
"1134","This gadget is amazing, I am picking up tv channels from around the world. I have 4 Roku's, and they are a lot of fun, but that would be comparing apples to oranges. All I can say is, get one, and play with it, you will be cutting your cable."
"1135","Loved the fire stick so much I bought a second one for my other TV and cut the cord--no more cable TV and I don't miss it."
"1136","No spanish networks/ channels, It froze the 2nd day, I think it was because the fire stick got to hot? disconnected it and then it worked. So far no trouble just wished we could unplug it with out logging in all the time we disconnect. Easy to install, the weird thing was that we just connecte the fire stick and it automatically logged in to my amazon acct. Then for amazon prime, the free trial movies are not that good and no variety."
"1137","This is a great idea for viewing movies and getting around boring cable channels but the design for the power location is poor. The power cable connects on the side of the fire stick and has the tendency to cause connection problems when the hdmi ports are located vertically on the tv. It would be better if the power connection was located on the end of the device since the fire stick casing can overlap the other hdmi port. Once connected though, you have great viewing options! Worth tye purchase."
"1138","What seemed so promising at the beginning of the installation had turned sour so quickly, many thanks to its inability of screen size adjustment (of which the 4k box has possessed). As a result, many words on the screen were cut-off, now you can play guess that word. To make matter worst, they blamed your TV, a nice touch on their part for not including a few extra codes that where included in the 4k box. However, I am hopeful that it can easily be addressed in the next software update to include that feature. May I also suggest that by adding  a micro sd card slot at the back of the stick would great enhanced its value. Until then, a 2 1/2 stars."
"1139","This is great, I did away with my cable and have been able to save $100. You can download all kinds of apps including Sling to get all your favorite shows. Also it's convenient to access all your Amazon Prime member benefits. You can also take it anywhere with you, which is a nice feature!"
"1140","love it but second day I got messages about slow internet speed and movies are buffering and pixels are blurry. will contact my internet provider to see if speed isn't fast enough. otherwise, it's easy to use with a great menu and I plan to dump my satellite company when my promotion ends."
"1141","Arrived two days ago.  Later than promised, but I suspect the demand was such that Amazon couldn't keep up with orders.  That being said, it was simple to install on our Vizio TV.  Alexa doesn't like my voice...she can't understand me probably because of my nasal Michigan accent.  So, my husband gets to talk to her.  We have Prime Membership and were surprised that many programs we wanted to watch still have a fee (ie the 4th season of Vikings and the third season of Turn).  Other than that, the remote is easy to use."
"1142","I'm on my second fire stick and it's not much better then the first one. Had all kinds of problems getting my WiFi to connect, and when it does it constantly disconnects. I just moved my tv 10ft closer to my router and still the same problems. I have the cord hooked to the fire stick for better reception, and I'm at most 15ft from the router. I've called the cable company, and they told me it's nothing else they can do, after speeding my internet up. When it works it's great but at this point it's been down for 3 days"
"1143","It's ok.  Set up could have been easier, there were no adequate instructions included.  I had to call someone who already had one and they had called tech support when installing theirs.  It would have been much simpler had instructions been included.  As for the firestick itself, it's ok too.  Has  a decent selection of apps.  To be honest, I bought it for one specific app that wasn't available thru the app store on my new television.  But it's an ok device."
"1144","This is more than I expected, ease of use and the free prime movies that I can now get on my TV that is not a smart TV.  It was this or a new blue ray, which we already have on another TV and mine works fine.  So glad that I decided on this."
"1145","We have a Google Chromecast device and now we have added the Fire TV Stick. We hardly ever use the chromecast now because the fire tv stick gives us way more options. Alexa is very handy to have and can compile a playlist of songs with a simple question!"
"1146","I wasn't sure if we would be able to access all the Prime stuff with the Fire Stick.  Oh yes.  Watched 2 movies that were clear and very recent.  The stick gives you access to some quick ""how to"" videos -they were expecially helpful since I am not a computer guru.  The remote was simple to use and perfect for us.  I am excited to use the photos and screen saver options but now, we are just happy to get movies."
"1147","$29.99 worth it. $39 is pushing it. Not enough games controllers are a little much. The controller it came with had dead batteries plus I've had to replace the new ones like every week and I barely use it. Need to put an 18650 in it with a charge port instead of AAA's. Also seems like a bunch of the movies and shows the kids watched a while back on prime for free are now pay to watch.  Siri doesn't do much for me but Alexa hasn't helped at all. Won't connect up with my wifi switches. The display is slightly bigger than my screen so cuts the edge off of menus, time, & status bars. Atleast better than my chrome cast that hardly worked and then died."
"1148","I have really been missing out on life.. LOL.. I have purchased two Fire sticks, one for upstairs and the basement.  I can watch any and everything I want without the headache of missing recordings.. This is the best thing since cell phones in my opinion, I have no idea how I've survived this long without it.. Well worth the investment and perfect gifts for friends and relatives who love movies and watching television series."
"1149","I love the Fire TV stick. Very easy to set up and use. I only gave 4 stars because I also have a Roku and I enjoyed how the Roku remotes allows you to hold onto the arrow buttons and scroll. Fire TV stick remotes makes you click each time for scrolling. Kind of annoying."
"1150","The Alexa function works very well and eliminates the tedious point and click keyboard searches of other similar devices. The picture quality and remote connectivity is perfect. The only complaint is the very short connecting cable which is included."
"1151","The remote is confusing and not at all intuitive to use. Who cares if it's small! Make it big enough to do everything it has to do without so much ""multi-tasking"". Not everyone who uses it is a 20 yr. old computer whiz!The content is very good and there is much to enjoy, but even that is like 'drinking from a fire hose'! Finding selections usually takes almost as long as watching the show. I suspect that many people are going to watch movies that are years old since the content of contemporary Hollywood is pure garbage!"
"1152","It arrived quickly, was easy to install and program apps. We bought it when our smart tv internet capability stopped working. The roku had been our staple for access on our other tv's but the fire stick seems much better right away! We shall see and update with any changes. Thank you!"
"1153","I have the Fire TV and was going away for the summer so I bought the Fire Stick. It's great! The UX is slick and constantly improving. The Alexa feature works well and comes in handy. Amazon channels work so much better than third-party apps (e.g. HBO). I love how Amazon goes out of its way to integrate this type of content."
"1154","The perfect compliment to any TV.  Lots of content, a snap to use, and no issues at all.  Check out some of the tutorial videos.  They will help teach you the power and features of this device, although not necessary to start out.  Worth every penny and more."
"1155","My fire stick works good. I am still trying to learn all it does. There is one concern. We are having a problem with our tv and are wondering if this had anything to do with the fire stick. The fire stick gets very hot. We unplugged it from the tv and after about 45 minutes to an hour we tested it with a heat gun. It was still 102 degrees. Just wondering if this is something to be worried about. If anyone else is having this problem and knows how to keep the heat down I would appreciate your feed back. I love Alexa."
"1156","Awesome Fire Stick! I bought one as many of my family members recommended... I am not disappointed, it is amazing! The interface resembles that of Netflix with the categories but has many options with prime video and streaming. Great product!"
"1157","I was on the fence for a long time with this product. I finally took a chance and ordered if on Black Friday.- I love this device! - it works ten times better than my Wii.- the set up is real easy!- the quality and the speed of it is superb!Just note that the stick is really long and if your HDMI plug is in the back of your TV, you might have to adjust it if it's up against the wall."
"1158","This is the 2nd Amazon stick I've purchased and I love it. I have this new one in my rv and I stream at 3g using WiFi. It says you need a high speed connection, but give it a few minutes to process and your good to go. I don't use Alexa, maybe I'll try it later."
"1159","This little item is great for watching whatever I want whenever I want. The only thing is the screen image is too wide for my TV and I can't see all the print that is on the left side of the screen. I know the more I use it it will get easier but for now I am still learning all it can do."
"1160","It took me a while to make the leap but I'm glad I did. Fire Stick is easy to use, reasonably priced and has lots of variety of movies and shows to watch. I love that I can stream my Amazon music and look at my photos too. I haven't cancelled cable yet but I'm definitely closer than ever."
"1161","LOVE this!! We use it everyday for our favorite TV shows and movies, and even music! We have the older version, Chromecast in the bedroom, but this offers so many more options. Super easy install, just plug it in and connect it to your wifi."
"1162","We were using our old Nintendo Wii for Netflix only. It died so we decided to give the fire stick a try.Just wow. Totally different experience for Netflix! Then bring able to access anything else that is app-based. Really love this thing. Picked up another one today for Black Friday to go with the new TV."
"1163","Since I already own a basic Fire Stick, this is not really any different. It runs smoothly and the menu controls are easy to navigate. Fire TV is a good streaming device.At $30.00, I thought I would try this Fire Stick with Alexa along with the Echo Dot. Having ""Alexa"" available on the Fire Stick is okay but, not as good as the Dot because the Dot is always available to answer questions. Anyway, the voice control is bit helpful to find a specific movie but, it has limited capabilities.Overall, Amazon Fire TV has kept up well with other streaming choices having a vast media selections and a good working product."
"1164","If you already have a Fire Stick, you know how this works. There are a couple improvements.Noticeably faster.AC (802.11ac) WiFi support. Works if you have a wireless router that supports this. Might notice difference for higher-bandwidth streams.It is larger than the previous version, but not by a lot.No other differences because it's running the same operating system."
"1165","my amazon app on my LG smart TV stopped working because my 4 yr old TV is already too old to get support by LG or Amazon.I reluctantly bought it but entirely different streaming world opened up, allowing me buy other streaming app with fast processing speed.Remote is not as convinient as my LG magic remote. other than that, it will bring you to the wonderful streaming TV world.I also wish it had some volume control button for TV that 's programmable with TV."
"1166","We have a Sony Bravia TV and Bluray player, which no longer were connecting to our wifi very well. This device is a quantum leap forward, even with our slow-ish 1.6Mbps DSL internet. Almost instant, with excellent quality picture and sound. Easy to download free apps to increase viewing options. Overall, just a great piece of tech, and a very reasonable price."
"1167","Received my stick two days ago.  Today my TV would  not recognize the stick.  After talking to customer support for half an hour,  I had an idea.  Changed out the included power cable with one of my own. It came right up.  If you get one, I suggest you use a cell phone charging cord."
"1168","After trying everything for a fix,thankfully due to another customer online, I was able to discover that the adapter and usb cable were defective. My amazon kindle cord saved the day. I waited too long to try it to return the usb and adapter. Besides it's irritating and inconvenient. Learned a lesson. With Amazon, act fast."
"1169","So far I really dig the Fire Stick.  I've only had it for a couple of weeks, but I'm impressed with how quick it is.  I used to access Amazon Prime Videos through the built-in app on my TV, and it was excruciatingly slow navigating around the menus and such, even though it was on hardwired Ethernet.  This thing is on Wi-Fi and it screams.  I've mostly been watching Homeland on the Showtime app, and it hasn't as much as stuttered during video playback.  I haven't played around with the voice commands much, but from what I've tested it seems to work.  I also do like the remote; it's simple but intuitive.  All in all a good value for the money."
"1170","The only reason I don't give it a 5-star rating is that the system connected to my 5G WIFI and was working perfectly, but twice now, out of the blue it looses the connection.  All other devices (cell, TV, PC, etc.) connect fine, but the Fire TV refuses to reconnect.  It shows however, the 2.4G as available; even though this works, I would like to connect at the fastest possible speed, which provides the best quality and viewing experience.  By the way, I tried ALL suggested solutions (on screen suggestions and technical advise online) but to no avail. Also, for those of us who have our TVs wall-mounted, it would be nice if the USB cable was longer."
"1171","Best Purchase Ive made in 2 years! I dropped my cable and have only internet now. Im saving 100.00+ a month and have a better TV selection.Im Im ordering another stick this Month!"
"1172","Brilliant design and very easy to setup!  An HDMI extension is included in case the stick exceeds the length of the HDMI spot, which is great, but they did one step even better.  They put the power connection on the side rather than out the back, which also effectively reduces adapter length.  The remote is sleek and well designed.  The menus interface is pleasing to the eye and makes for easy navigation, the voice feature is the main reason I upgraded from my Roku.  Also, it searches across platforms, e.g., Netflix, Showtime, etc., so it doesn't require knowledge of which service to look under for a show or movie.  Whoever designed this is BRILLIANT!!"
"1173","My son told me about this product - I had to purchase another product - and a small TV - but now I can carry my shows throughout my 3 story studio - with ease.  This works...and it's so user friendly.  I don't know anyone who is as bad as I am with electronics - but, my son said I could do it  and I gave it a try.  I LOVE IT.  SOOOO user friendly!!!"
"1174","All the TV, movies and sports in the ""WHOLE WIDW WORLD!""  Once you get it install Kodi"
"1175","Does exactly what it promises to do.  Hassle free, great form factor.  Responsive and fluid UI / navigation.I previously had a Roku Streaming Stick and the Fire TV stick is leagues ahead of it.I'm really enjoying this purchase."
"1176","Don't buy this if you want to watch Netflix. The newest generation Firesticks have an issue where the Netflix app will load but content will cease to load at 25% and an error message occurs. This has happened to me for over 3 weeks but the issue itself has occurred for 7 weeks without being fixed. Look through the Netflix on Firestick TV Forums for more info.Sadly, I used this for a year before the issue occurred and has not been addressed or I would return it. Bought an old Roku though. Not nearly as elegant or sleek as the Fire TV, but at least I can watch what I pay for!"
"1177","I really do like the stick when it works.  There are so many great features and amazing new shows, but the stick is constantly freezing.  I am very frustrated because after the factI did research and it seems that this a very common issue."
"1178","Great product with reservations. I would give this 5 stars except for some aspects that made it unacceptable for my particular use. I originally got it for a rental house specifically to provide DIRECTV now streaming service as cable substitute for guests. The problem is securing it from unscrupulous folks. After a certain time the dtvnow app requires a password to open again and if you password protect purchases it requires that pin as well.Other than that picture and use are great. For most folks at home the protections are good for children so I would highly recommend it for normal home use.  In my case I replaced it with Apple TV."
"1179","I LOVE the Fire TV Stick! The best streaming stick I've had. I love that it's connected to my amazon account. It has all kinds of options for me to watch. It even gives me other ways to watch so, I don't just have to use Netflix or Hulu. And, if I see something interesting I want to watch later I can add it to my watchlist. I can even search for something to watch while at amazon.com. I've also found amazing relaxation music for daughter to listen to while she sleeps! And, I can watch live tv with it which, is awesome when someone else is watching tv in the living room. Love, love, love, this product. Would recommend for friends and family."
"1180","I really didn't think I needed a Fire Stick since I already have a Smart TV with Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, etc. I bought my Mom a Fire Stick and then my sister got one. Naturally, they wanted to get me one too. With a discount, it ended up being around $12.00, so I couldn't say no to that. I hooked it up and haven't used my Smart TV apps since!!! The cable apps on the Fire Stick (with subscription to local cable) give me more than I could EVER watch and I may even cancel Hulu because of all the options available within the Fire Stick! LOVE Alexa and the voice command feature. Can't believe I waited so long to try this! Worth every penny!"
"1181","I love the Amazon Fire TV stick that it so inexpensive, small, a WIFI hdmi extersion/antenna, voice activated Bluetooth remote, full of free apps like youtube and VEVO. The only negative I must mention is that the in-capability of adjusting the tv screen size using Amazon setting like the previous version of Fire TV and Fire TV stick. Instead it now rely on customer's tv that have the capability to change the screen size. Not all tv have this capability. Even if the tv have this capability,  you have to re-adjust when you switch to another HDMI device like your xbox and computer. Amazon should fix this when they release the next software version."
"1182","I'm impressed. It's not perfect, but it's really good. I have used related devices like AppleTV, Roku, and Intel Compute Stick for video streaming (all of which were much more expensive and much slower) but this blows them all away. I pre-ordered one with trepidation about getting something so new to the market, but now that I've used it on the family room TV, I'm ordering a second for the TV in the bedroom. I really like the Alexa voice command technology. I could nit-pick about some small points, but for less than $40, this is impressive technology. Most of the (relatively minor) issues that I've had have been with the TV apps, not so much with the FireStick itself."
"1183","I gave this 5 stars. The only thing I do not like about it is that I have a hard time warching all the TV programs. The movies are great. I completely canceled netflix and hulu, so this will save our family money in a few months. Thanks for the fast shipping seller."
"1184","It works beautifully, in terms strictly of function.  But it is seriously lacking in documentation.  Instructions for installing the stick itself are simple, and instillation is almost absurdly easy.  Working the remote is less easy to figure out, but not bad.  But figuring out how to use the program - that's difficult. If you're thinking of buying one, have someone who is already using one explain the ins-and-outs first, to avoid considerable frustration."
"1185","I purchased two Amazon Fire Sticks with Alexa Voice and couldn't be happier. The price is great and the Alexa feature is a nice benefit. As an undergraduate student, the Fire Stick allows me to have entertainment that is not terrible expensive. I am very thankful for this product! I bought the protection plan as well, but I hope I never need to use it."
"1186","After 7 months of use, the product just stopped working. I first thought it was a battery issue but after replacing them with brand new Duracell AAA batteries, the malfunction persisted. I contacted Amazon and they told me how to restart it, and it finally reacted. Thanks"
"1187","Love the various apps available.  Amazon has some really great original shows.  My son loves talking to Alexa too.Only bad thing is, there's no headphone jack on the remote (like another media streaming device).But, overall, pretty cool."
"1188","So fast, streams wirelessly with no hesitation, and my WiFi base is 50' away on another floor.  Amazon, Hulu, Plex YouTube (and dozens more), and even Dish Anywhere now.... the Dish Anywhere app from Dish Network is (believe it or not) faster than the Joey unit that's connected by cable.  Guess I can stop wasting money on that every month."
"1189","Easy to set up and use.  I wish they would design one where you could enter the channel number and go stratight to the channedl rather than having to do to the guide and page.  The picture is actually better with the fire stick on my HDTV rather than cable.  taht was a surprise."
"1190","so far so good.  Seems to be working great.  I needed this as VIZIO does not support all functions of Amazon Prime Movies.  For instance, you can't see your play list of movies"
"1191","Our third fire stick.  Love the ease of use and all of the features it adds to a tv.  We even have one on our smart tv that can technically do alot of the same stuff but we use the firestick because its so much faster and smoother to operate."
"1192","I have no idea what these 1 starts are talking about. I have the stick and the box and they both have worked flawlessly.Great product. The only thing missing is the ability to cast your phone or tablet to you TV through it. Unless I'm missing something."
"1193","It's an awesome product so far.  My daughters love them (bought two--one for each of their rooms!  My 6 year old daughter asks Alexa daily for the weather forecast--she's become our little weather girl and my 13 year old gets to watch shows/movies in her age range. :)Now my hubby and I have the TV back to ourselves again and we can watch shows/movies that we like to watch. :)"
"1194","I replaced my original Fire TV Stick with the All-New Fire TV Stick for three reasons.  First, my old stick often required a restart to correct issues with caching and failure to recognize my wireless network.  Second, my old stick was sluggish when opening apps such as Netflix.  Finally, I like the new voice recognition and Alexa features of the new stick.  I find the new stick to be much more responsive and I am beginning to use the Alexa and voice search, both a great.  Though I have many fewer issues with caching, I still find that every so often I must restart the stick.  The good news is that the reboot is much faster and far less annoying."
"1195","Works great - not ""exactly"" what I expected, but that's because my expectations were rather vague to begin with - a friend recommended it as a means to completely drop ALL cable, but so far I've found it misses some of my requirements...."
"1196","Huge Amazon fan with the stick and fire tv. My only recommendation for improvement is the organization of the videos/shows that you buy. They should have their own tab, and it would be nice to custom sort. For example, by purchase date or alphabetical or genre etc. Right now they are all thrown together by purchase date only. And, it would be great if they created a customizable viewing option. Like on a computer you can choose icon size which will determine how many file thumbnails you see at once. Well, with these you can only see like 4 or 5 at a time and scroll left to right only. What about up and down....MAKE ROWS AND COLUMNS AMAZON!"
"1197","Love it! Super fast and easy to use. I wish it had a power off button though. It's neat that it's also an Alexa enabled device-- just press and hold the mic button to track orders! Also, no need to type and search for your favorite shows again!"
"1198","I bought one of these about a month ago when my psn account was compromised. It does a good job with most things but Hulu streaming is a no-go. The HD looks really nice but any kind of panning or movement is very choppy. It seems like the fps suffers while trying to keep it in HD. Funny considering it isn't even 4k lol. Also when using youtube I encountered a strange issue. If you pause and then unpause the video speeds up super fast with no audio and then catches up to where you left off. It is ridiculous to look at and just annoying. At least netflix and amazon videos work fine....*knocks on wood*"
"1199","I am so happy with my Fire Stick and all it does. I'm not so thrilled with Alexa Voice remote, she cannot seem to understand or help me with much..but I also haven't spent much time trying to get her to work, I sit in front of the TV and manually use the remote and it works just fine. I'm thrilled with this combined with Amazon Prime, there's been so much awesome stuff to watch, NO need for cable! YEEESSSSS!"
"1200","I really like this product. I disconnected my TV services and now enjoy more TV/Movie watching than ever before at a great cost saving. I may purchase another one and have recommended it to my friend who still are paying high fees to their cable providers"
"1201","WOW!!! I never knew what I was missing out on... now, I can watch what I want when I want.  No schedule to wait on, no programming I can't change.  I'm thinking seriously about getting a second one.  I'm REALLY enjoying this Fire TV stick!"
"1202","Love it, love it, love it!  Alexa has changed my life!  I can go from Amazon Prime to Netflix with ease.  Play music, watch tv shows or movies.  If you don't know how to do it, just ask Alexa and she'll do it for you.  I bought 2 of them.  One for the living room and one for my bedroom.  Fantastic!"
"1203","I must admit, I didn't know what this product was even used for until my husband wanted to try one. We both use it daily and watch Netflix on it. The kiddos love it, too. I don't know how we ever lived without it, it's just so convenient!"
"1204","I have an Apple TV and my daughter wanted something for college to watch Netflix and Hulu.  I figured for $30 why not see if this meets her needs without having to spend a bunch more for an Apple TV. It works fine for her and very easy to use."
"1205","Every few days, I have to cycle the power because it freezes up or stalls so badly that it's equivalent to locking up. At first, I thought it was the Plex media program, but it did the same thing when trying to watch a ball game on ESPN's app."
"1206","Love PRIME. and this is perfect for my movies. Easy to install and works great.  NOW NOT SO HAPPY.... Get the insurance, lasted 5 months and the remote will not turn on, new batteries etc, but dead.  So with this said, 5 STAR for Prime and 3 stars for the product."
"1207","This is the 1st firestick we've owned, bought it for my daughters room.  Alexa doesn't work too great. When asking her to skip 10, 20, 30 seconds or rewind she doesn't do it. Or when asking Alexa to do something else she doesn't understand frequently.  While on Netflix all of a sudden it will turn to YouTube without touching remote or asking to go to Youtube.  We are kinda disappointed with the product as I was excited to purchase it & waited for this generation to come out with Alexa voice.  I gave it 3 stars because it's like turning my tv into a smart tv with all the apps available on the firestick but Alexa voice not so great on here."
"1208","Working fine. Not as intuitive on voice commands as it could be. Perhaps I need to play around with some settings, but, for example, I request a movie that I have via a paid movie service (e.g. Netflix), and those options don't come up. I used with USB into a Sony Bravia TV, and it had enough power to work. On another TV, I had to plug into an outlet. Would be better to have a little longer cord for this purpose. Firestick plugs into HDMI port on TV. Can be a little tricky getting it into the back of a TV that's against a wall due to its size. I do recommend the Firestick, but I think it's a couple generations away from being top of class."
"1209","I was grateful for help I received from Amazon on setting up the device. Person I reached was very patient given my dopey mistakes etc, and finally got device and me functioning. Main issue for me is that 1) I am simple not a devoted consumer of 'media'. Having access to every film ever made holds little allure to me, And 2) I do find the visual displays of all the choices/options/titles are much too challenging of my attention to make hanging in there to see if anything grabs me much too challenging. Maybe over time, with encouragement from family etc, I will warm to the device....."
"1210","I love love love the firestick. Also love the Chromecast but this makes it so much easier to access the apps that I want. The only thing I don't like is that I got it mostly for my 2 year old and a lot of the cartoons that she likes they charge for on amazon prime video."
"1211","I use this with my Amazon Prime account. I cut the cable a long time ago so I wanted some way to watch things every now and then.This came with some pretty cool incentives. I got a month of free Sling TV and 10 dollars to use to buy shows on Amazon. I don't know if everyone gets this but it was a nice addition.Sling TV is not worth the price but I still tried out the free month.My only gripe about the Fire stick is there is no real off button. After you are not actively watching something it automatically turns off but if you stop watching you pretty much just turn off your TV and it turns off. Maybe I'm old fashioned."
"1212","The fire stick can be a little slow at times. It is working great though as I am using it along with Kodi, It is also easy to move from place to place if need be. The voice remote is also nice, I have samsung smartthings in my home along with some echo dots. It is nice not having to get up to turn the lights off or the fan and a/c, I am very happy with the fire stick,."
"1213","It's in our spare room, so it doesn't get used nearly as much as the Fire Tv Box on our main tv in our living room.My complaint about the Alexa remote on the Fire Tv Box also applies here.Buyers should remember that the Fire Tv Stick uses ONLY wifi for internet. Hope you have a good router, with a good built in antenna,or you might have speed/ buffer issues with 1080p content"
"1214","Love it . We just got rid of our cable and this is def. a good alternative ! Do know that the stick has to be plugged in which I think is lameee ! I had a roku and its wireless so I expected the same from this but nope must be plugged in to work ! But other than that great buy. Also, Alexa understands me which is great b/c I'm from the south &' usually siri never understands my accent so that's a plus lol ."
"1215","The Fire TV Stick works alright, but it has some issues with the software. It just doesnt feel polished. It will reboot randomly, the apps can be glitchy (more of the app developer's issue, but the same issue plagues multiple apps (force quits unexpectedly))Video quality is pretty good and it is definitely better than the chromecast I had which is all I was hoping for.I hope amazon improves this product. I would consider buying the improved version."
"1216","The video works fine as did my outdated Roku that was not able to access CBS All Acc.  NETFLIX WORKS fine but you have to switch the audio off of 5.1 for movies when hooked up to my Pyle projector and stereo or the internal speaker.  The issue comes in with watching Amazon movies since there is no audio option to switch off the 5.1.This issue is not present when I tried it with my TCL tv.Technical was able to assist and deactivate the Dolby setting."
"1217","Very good, but unsure about the free downloads.  Will I be charged for those downloads after my Prime trial period is over? What is the cost for the programs through those downloads?  I do not have a television provider, I have wifi internet.  I would like to get the evening news each day for that day, but must I also pay for that separately from the Prime $10.99 monthly fee?  Also, Alexa is always able to find what I want.  Why is that?"
"1218","Worked as advertised...  I cut the cord to cable and now only have internet.  I cut my bill from $207.00 to $77.00.  I'll also get Fubotv.com for all my sports channels and that will add $34.99 for the months I need it.  Otherwise I'll just stream the channels I want to watch included in the $77.00..."
"1219","I connected it to my Onkyo TX-NR757 front aux HDMI port and am happy with picture and sound. Set up was easy. I'm a prime member and the free movie selections not bad but only have had the stick 3 days so don't know how often or how many free movies are added. Haven't checked out the free prime music much just yet but not impressed with the choices so far. Voice remote works well and some nice extra options such as xray view on movies, it will show actors name and some of their other work in the current scene when you pause the movie."
"1220","The amazon fire stick is awesome! The only thing that is kind of dumb in my mind is that you have to download almost every app that you want to use. I thought they would already be pretty downloaded. And I thought there would be alot more free movies, but you have to subscribe to every movie app (Netflix, Hulu, etc.). But besides that I love it. And I really like how the remote has the talk to search button"
"1221","Bought this for an inexpensive 40” LCD tv mostly to watch Amazon Prime movies and TV shows.  The search function for movies and tv shows works differently from the Amazon app on my smart tv. Takes a little getting used to Was easy to setup and use.  If you have setup wireless devices before, you probably don’t need the instructions."
"1222","Nice Product with one issue,I purchased the fire stick to view Amazon content on a TV in my basement.  The reception is very good and the menus are easy to navigate.One Major flaw.  Low Sound on streaming video.  The sound is louder on the Pandora App, but for Streaming video it is much lower.  So much lower I can't watch video while something is running in the back ground like a treadmill even with the speakers turned up all the way..I wanted to add a supplemental Speakers but there is no way to hook up to my TV or Fire stick.So im stuck with no options.  Even Technical support could not help."
"1223","I bought 2 new fire sticks and they are indeed faster (similar to my fire tv) but there seems to be an issue with Plex that I don't have with my older Fire Sticks and Fire TV. The problem is audio stutter or drop out every 20 seconds or so.The video looks great but the audio issue makes it impossible to watch media with Plex. Unfortunately I use Plex a lot so I am just going to continue to use my older devices until the updates catch up with the issue... if they do.I did test both devices, reset factory defaults, changes the hmdi extenders but both show the same problem using Plex. I am not sure if I will return these yet. There were some issues with Plex and Fire devices when they first came out but the issues were resolved apparently.I am leaning towards keeping the devices and if so hopefully the problem I am experiencing will be fixed with updates. If so my rating would change to 5 stars. The picture looks great (in Plex) and it is faster but the sound or stutter in playback is my only issue. The devices were tested 13"" from my router too so signal strength is not an issue.I do have Prime and Netflix accounts and haven't really tested those yet. The Netflix show I am watch doesn't seem to have playback issues."
"1224","Me and my wife are avid Amazon shoppers and when we seen Amazon coming out with a second generation Fire Stick that is Quad core and has Alexa we had to get it and give it a whirl. Now we have owned the  first generation Fire Stick and loved it and still have it but it was a dual core but still worked great BUT this New Fire Stick is awesome. No buffering issues,no lagging,crisp clear picture rather you watch Netflix or Amazon prime. We also have PlayStation Vue and have had absolutely no problems with it at all. Now our internet only runs anywhere from 1-5 mbps which is slow but this Fire Stick handles it great or we wouldn't have it. A must own... we love it!!!!"
"1225","This is my second fire stick and I love my first one. I haven't got to use this one cause I can't get it open to put the batteries in. I am so frustrated. I have done what the instructions say, my husband has tried, we have even mared the the back of it trying to pry it open. If I can ever get the batteries in it to use it I'm sure I would love it as well as my first one.  DOES ANYONE HAVE A SUGGESTION??????"
"1226","My second Amazon fire TV stickIt works great with this new age of technology you can now watch on demand TV and video with this setup forget about cable and switch the Amazon Fire TV.The remote with voice included works great"
"1227","Awesome!! Hands down best stick or TV movie device you can buy thus far. The voice is awesome. I can run Plex, the big ""K"" (legally too) and all the HBO, Showtime etc apps (paid services) apps/games amazon prime video and games etc etc etc all on my TV.... but still access my home theater, pair my BT headphones to it for night watching so I don't keep the wife up etc. I'm the only person I know who uses Kodi legally lol...but it supports EVERYTHING I've thrown at it even my home theater harddrives on my computer so it's the ultimate box/stick for me. I've had an android box, Roku, AppleTV and chromecast and this does EVERYTHING they do in one stick. I was only going to buy a remote for my 1st gen model because it'll support the voice feature of the new remotes with it but for 10.00 more I got another stick and remote and the remote will pair to either stick so I just bought an additional one. Now I have one in the bedroom and livingroom and if I want voice on the 1st gen model I just pair it up via BT to that stick and wait a few seconds and I'm good to go."
"1228","I heard and now i saw. This is such a wonderful gadget, super easy to set up and compact. No longer do i have to hook up my computer to the TV via HDMI, the firestick has remedied all of that. Almost every app I use on a regular basis is on here. I am so happy and grateful to my best friend for buying this lovely gift for my birthday and i highly recommend you get it."
"1229","Easy to set up and easy to learn.  Fairly intuitive but it could be even better with the right designer.  The voice search is a great idea but it takes too much navigation after a voice search.  A programmable button to change my TV input would simplify the entire process."
"1230","I absolutely loved this product. Made watching videos extremely easy and convenient. The price is competitive with similar units on the market today.2 month update: I upgraded from the TV stick to Fire TV. I was having over heating problems despite using HDMI extender. After about 4 hrs of use it would get hot enough where I couldnt touch it. No problems with new unit"
"1231","Why do I have cable tv when I have a fire-stick!  This is the most wonderful device ever, I love it."
"1232","Works great, easy setup.  I was already a prime member so that made it pretty smooth.  Also have a amazon dot, so could immediately use the voice remote to control all the skills I had set up.  Quick response and no steaming issues.  I like the screensaver pictures it brings up by default.  Since this runs an Android OS I could use apps not available on some other streaming sticks.  This replaced my roku stick(older version), It is noticeably faster as I would expect.  Working great, just have to get a longer usb cable to power it, it is not long enough hide in the wall with my other cables...  or re-run where I have my power outlets..."
"1233","I baught this fire stick so I can run Kodi tv on it. Which I have been. I added it to my tcl (roku) tv. I'm finding my self liking the app device I do enjoy using the voice command it comes with. The format is different than Roku not better nor worse just different. I have Amazon prime which allows you to fully access all its features. Yes you can side load Kodi on it, again that was the only reason why I bought it. Plus now when I travel I'll take it with me since my tv it a Roku tv and it's not portable. I gave it a five star because it works great for the price comparison to the Roku the voice command is cheaper with the first stick."
"1234","Get this instead of the new Apple TV, I haven't found a single application that the Apple TV has and this one doesn't. (Of course, iTunes doesn't apply). This little device works perfectly and has a very intuitive UI. Amazing deal and quality."
"1235","We enjoy the convenience of the movies and have no trouble accessing amazon movies. We however are having difficulty watching other movies. There seems to be a glitch of some sort where the movies stop sometimes they will restart and sometimes not?"
"1236","the amazon fire stick is great.it has a great variety of apps and even supports ethernet(with proper adapters,;like the otg cable with power in and ethernet adapter) I do suggest a motion control navigation with remote and multiple language support for all countries.overall the device is great.just keep gun mind if you live in a certain country that does not really use specific language you may need too choose a different country on fire stick settings."
"1237","It is great so far, but unfortunately it doesn’t allow for all apps that I would like to include such as my Vudu account - definitely disappointed that I can’t have that account included. I think I would order a ruku as they allow for ALL appsz"
"1238","I absolutely love the Fire Stick. I don't know why I waited so long to get one. The picture on my TV screen is so incredibly sharp and crystal clear. My only criticism is I wish there was another way to search for shows other than asking Alexa to ""find"" something, because she doesn't always understand me."
"1239","I have the original Fire TV which has been great. I recently mounted our TV on the wall above our fireplace and needed something slim to use, so there were no cords hanging out. This is not as fast or responsive as the original Fire TV, but is pretty close. I do wish that they made a stick with really great specs. My real issue with this is the remote. The original had a textured back to it, and really sticks in your hand well. This one however, is cheap plastic and is slicker than greased goose crap. It just doesn't fell good in your hand at all. I may try to pair the old remote with this one, but it's a real shame they made this change for the worst."
"1240","After one week no longer connects to Netflix. Sorry I bought it. Guess I'll get a Roku. Update...I received an email from Amazon with instructions as to how to fix the connection issue. Worked like a charm. Will save directions for future problems."
"1241","I had lots of problems getting this to work, I even contacted Amazon customer service, where they went through everything that I had already checked online. YouTube some of the issues with this; I had the unable to connect to network, unable for the remote to connect with the system... both very annoying when it''s hard to test workarounds. Oddly enough, it worked on a friend's WiFi network, so I did a factory reset and restarted. Works fine now...But I'd still like a more intuitive setting for calibrating the screen. It keeps saying refer to the TV, but the TV believes it's calibrated and the Amazon page extends beyond the borders...."
"1242","Its a handy little product with one annoying design flaw.  The power adapter for the HDMI stick is kinda long making it awkward to plug in behind a wall mounted tv.  I had to purchase a wall socket adapter that allowed me to plug the fire stick adapter sideways.  If you don't use the adapter that came with it you end up with service interruptions.  If you are planning on using this behind a wall mounted tv - purchase one of these3 Way Outlet Wall Tap - Vertical Shape Triple Prong Wall Splitter Adapter For Behind Furniture - Multi Plugin Locations (2) On Right Side & (1) On Left Side- Green Color ( UL Listed ) - By Katzco"
"1243","Absolutely love it !!! Kodi and good fellas is a must to add on !! You can get the instructions from YouTube to install those programs, it only takes about 20 minutes to install."
"1244","I couldn't be happier with my firestick! If you are a Prime member, have a Netflix,Hulu, or DIRECTV  account you have even more options available to you. With DIRECTV you can download the channel apps that you like and link them to your account and you have your favorite DIRECTV wherever you go. There are so many functions from cooking to yoga. What ever your interest you are sure to find something that you will enjoy. The price is unbeatable at $39.99. You only have to make sure you have decent internet service to stream the shows."
"1245","Love it! I received it as a gift. The hook up and set up was easy. The streaming is seamless and image is clear. Only negative is that the remote control goes thru batteries fast and they must be replaced. Otherwise a wonderful product."
"1246","I just got the Fire TV Stick with Alexa and am in love. Why? Because I love technology and innovation and this is a giant leap over the wifi portal I had in the past. Simple to install and set up (I think it took all of five minutes which would have been faster if not for the long password needed for my router). And I must confess that I am in love with Alexa. We have been dating for several months now since she came into my life in the Amazon Tap. Now with the Fire Stick we can spend even more quality time together watching great movies. Downside? My wife has become very jealous."
"1247","I love the Amazon Fire Stick. I have amazon prime, Hulu, and Netflix and the three combined are awesome. I never have a problem finding something to watch! Got one for my dad too! He travels a lot so it's great for hotel rooms and such."
"1248","What an amazing addition to an older TV. I plugged it in and everything just worked. And... since I am an Amazon Prime User, it was all pre-registered; all my apps and tools where there; my music was there. It came with Alexa voice activated... I have a Samsung Smart TV and I'm thinking about getting one for that just for the Alexa feature alone. Kudos to Amazon! Best $39.00 I've ever spent."
"1249","The Fire Stick is awesome. I connect it to my garage TV when I'm working out, and can very easily move it back into the house when I want to. The apps are easy to download, it connected to my wireless router incredibly fast. Very happy."
"1250","Easy to install, fast to use, Alexa thing works well, and I like the interface better than my Blu-ray player's format for streaming services.  Only thing I don't like is I can't use my Harmony smart remote with it-not compatible so I have to use 2 remotes instead of just one.  Not really a fault of the Fire Stick but would have been convenient.  Gave 5 stars because the remote issue isn't necessarily their issue but still inconvenient."
"1251","Excellent product. Works extremely well, remote is easy to use, though the voice feature is not up to par with all apps. Besides that the menu is well thought out and easy to use. Device is reliable, and streamlined. Highly recommend checking out sling tv subscription."
"1252","I purchased this to allow me to stream with my Amazon Prime account.  It works great, is easy to set up, and the voice control function is amazing.  I would recommend this for any Amazon Prime customer.  It is very well worth the price."
"1253","Have an older smart tv and Hulu would not work on it - always freezing. Purchased Fire Stick per Hulu reps suggestion. No issues now. Love the mic to tell what I want to watch!!!! Better than a smart tv because you dont have to search by typing."
"1254","Cable be gone! I love to binge watch TV as much as the next person, but truth is, I hardly ever watch cable/dish/satellite/whatever TV so as soon as I bought the Fire Stick, I ditched the cable and am saving $80/month which is HUGE. The Fire Stick works well and is easy to use. It is definitely worth it if you already have existing subscriptions such as Hulu, Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, Prime, Amazon TV, YouTube, etc. This was so completely worth it for me and my husband that I can't believe I even bothered with cable in the first place when we moved in together. So glad we can watch what we want, when we want, and we don't need a box."
"1255","although I was thrilled to get fire stick, I only had it for a few weeks and didn't watch it that much when it froze on me and gave me all kinds of problems.  It was extremely hot and I had to unplug it.  I tried to reset it several times to no avail!  Finally got so frustrated I am returning it because I think it fried or something.  Perhaps I just got a bad one.  When I first got it, it was great.  I don't recommend buying electronics online as I am not sure if they are used or not and much harder to return."
"1256","Honestly this was a waste of money for me.  I have a smart TV in my bedroom so I paid $50 for the same apps built into my tv.  I plan to move it to my living room where it will see more action.  I discontinued use of the Fire Stick once it became clear that my TV was light years faster than the stick. I actually blame my poor internet for this. Happy to update the review once I move it into my living room.  I've had an Apple TV for the last 8 years in the guest room and it works like a charm, however I decided to purchase the stick for access to Prime TV."
"1257","Device is just ok.  Very slow response when navigating menu's and slow to play content/shows.  Roku Premier, is much better, much faster"
"1258","Perfect.. Brand new and fast shipping, set up is easy and simple to use.Fun playing games too and lots of free ones to choose fromThank you"
"1259","I absolutely love my new FireStick!!!! I initially purchased the Chromecast and it was fine, but I didn't like the fact that I had to use my phone as a remote. I don't have cable and decided to get Netflix and Hulu. I have family coming to visit me this summer and thought how would my guests access tv when I'm away without having my cell phone. So, I decided to purchase the Amazon FireStick and I am so glad that I did. I returned the Chromecast back to Target. Definitely recommend the FireStick. It is an excellent streaming device."
"1260","I have the original Fire TV Stick which I purchased over 2-1/2 years ago, which still works fantastically and which I still rate at 5 stars.I received the new 2 generation Fire TV Stick 3 weeks ago for another t-v and now question it's reliability. Like many others, I am having issues with the remote. Over the last 2 weeks, I've had to reset the remote (take out batteries for a minute then re-install batteries) more than 6 times. In addition, removing the back cover of the remote is extremely difficult. However, I guess I'm one of the lucky ones as I am still able to use the stick after resetting the remote. When it works, it is great. I believe manufacturing quality control is suffering due to the high demand of the stick. It is continually back ordered by about 3 weeks. Also with only a 3 month warranty one has to think that Amazon knows about the lack of quality and reliability.  Hopefully, a software update will correct the remote issue. I am a loyal fan of Amazon products but this remote issue will certainly tarnish Amazon's name if it isn't resolved soon. I've told friends and relatives NOT to purchase the stick at this time. I gave it a 3 star rating only because I am able to reset the remote...at least for now."
"1261","Works great as far as remote for movies but when it come to picture that sucks. I probably spent a total of 75 hours speaking with 10 to 15 different Representatives just trying to download all of my pictures. and I still can't get all of them on. Only $8,000 12,000 I'm able to download. You sent me an email with the remote was some sort of box at the same price. I can't remember exactly what the box was but if it has better lock with pictures let me know. Something might be wrong with my remote. All my pictures are downloaded in in Amazon account but they won't show up on my TV."
"1262","This is an awesome product. Giving 5 even though  Alexa does not understand my accent for certain words, yet (I have 100% trust in that Alexa team will improve that!!) and if I want to set the product to 'sleep mode' I have to go to settings > device. We should be able to set some shortcuts for most used actions.Apart from that LOVING IT!!"
"1263","This device is not all inclusive, it leads you back to pay for view like a Apple TV, but you get some movies with Prime.  The movies have a darker hue, and the sound volume does not work with your stereo or TV volume.  It took some adjustments, when I got it work, but the sound level was very low.If you are expecting a get multiple channels and moves free, this is not it."
"1264","Got it for my daughter who doesn't have cable. It streams tons of stuff for free and more with Amazon Prime.  It has a lot of the Echo apps, maybe all of them.  I got her the 35 foot antennae so she also gets local channels.  It has a voice remote.  And it's incredibly easy to install."
"1265","Still slow/laggy like the older fire stick. Alexa is nearly useless. I cannot get Alexa to jump back or auto rewind on any show even though I'm trying exactly as advertised. Alexa will only find some shows/movies you ask and then you still have to click like 7 times to get anything to actually start playing. The remote has a matte finish yet is somehow super slippery and awkward to hold, plus it's rounded base makes it rock back and forth on your coffee table when you set it down.The biggest issue is the lag while using it. I often think it didn't recognize a button push but it's really just thinking long and hard about scrolling."
"1266","This thing exceeded my expectations.  I've seen the ROKU and the Apple TV, and toyed with both extensively.  It wasn't enough to convince me to buy them, with some of the glitches and format they had.  The Fire TV Stick, on the other hand, was spontaneous purchase.  Since I have a Prime account, I thought what harm was there to try it.  If I didn't like it, I could return it, right?  BUT the set up was super easy and the options really impressed me.  Streaming flowed nicely!  I was hooked instantaneously.  This was one of THE best purchases I made for 2016!  I recommend it to anyone.  Even a colleague tossed her Apple TV and got this!"
"1267","I love this product.  The picture it produces on my TV is great.  I am sorry I waited so long to purchase it.  You get a lot of free movies and shows with the Fire TV Stick and Amazon Prime.  The Alexa remote works with no glitches.  This is a great addition to the Amazon product line. It is easy to install and to use."
"1268","I already have the original TV Stick but finding movies was not the easiest with onscreen keyboard.  Just ask it to find a movie and it does a great job quickly.  It is faster than the older stick too.  I have it linked to my Echo too."
"1269","Easy setup right out of the box...the packaging is inventive; one might say artful in design. Nothing involved with this product is overlooked. The Firestick brought an older model LG tv back to life. I will be ordering more to supplement the digital antennas in the other rooms!"
"1270","This little thing is just AWESOME!!! It took me a few minutes to get everything set up and used to the tiny little remote but it's just awesome. We're now downsizing our cable bill because we don't need so much now that we've got this."
"1271","I bought this fire stick with Alexa for use with Playstation Vue. Playstation Vue works great on my ps4. I have been using it on my ps3 on my other TV. Ps3 os too slow for the vue app. So I went and purchased fire stick. It is faster than the ps3, fast enough for ps vue app to work. It works good but at times it lags a bit. For $40 you can't beat it. I also had Amazon Prime and that is a plus. Would highly recommend it."
"1272","I bought a second one for my living room but i think the remote for the second is defective. It is not reading when i try to hoover to chose shows and i have to really move the remote around to find a sweet spot, which can be really frustrating....:/"
"1273","very pleased with my purchase. does exactly what i'd hoped it would do, and more! everyone's been telling me to buy one for months. i decided to make some changes. i'll save some dough every month in the triple digits now. well worth purchasing!"
"1274","One feature that's missing is integration of the keyboard into the companion app. If I or my family want to search something by name by typing it in (my family's accents are hard for Alexa to understand), we have to use the remote's buttons to click on each individual button. It would be better if the actual app keyboard and the on-screen keyboard were mirrored when searching things this way.Also, English is my first language, but Alexa still couldn't make sense of my requests--just my experience with it.Overall, though, interface is easy to navigate and I like having everything consolidated under one device."
"1275","Still trying to get use to navigating. Also not sure if we still need to maintain an account with Hulu and Netflix or is buying the Amazon Fire Stick is all we need to access our accounts as that is why we purchased the stick in the first place to save on monthly fees. We will never go back to cable or satellite again over priced for so many channels that we do not want or watch. Commercial TV with our digital antenna is bad enough for our kids to watch with all the commercial about this medication for erectile dysfunction that they do not need to hear about every other commercial. Not to mention the take a pill to fix this or that."
"1276","Absolutely love it...system was a bit confusing during installation setup but after many failed attempts at navigation..finally got the hang of it..so Much so I ordered more..so soon bye bye satellite company (hint..hint..DISHNETWORK) and hello to free TV"
"1277","Live my fire tv stick.  My fire t.v. went out and I was years past the warranty and there weren't any refurbished available.  Customer service worked with me and gave me a discount on the stick and I can't tell the difference.  I love this!"
"1278","I love everything about the fire stick!I only have have Wi-Fi internet so having the fire stick definitely makes the nights being home less boring, lol.I connected my hulu, Netflix, and Direct Tv Now to it and I have an endless amount of choices on what to watch. It's easy to use and figure out. With the direct tv now I can stay up to date with shows and switch to live tv without the hassle of having any type of satellites or dish or excessive amount of cables lying around just to watch tv. It's just the Wi-Fi and the fire stick.I love it! I definitely would recommend anyone to get one."
"1279","Works fantastic.  We cancelled cable tv to save money and this is a great alternative.  The selection of apps seems almost unlimited.  The remote is very responsive and easy to use.  Alexa voice is a huge time saver too.  It is geared towards Amazon Prime when compared to its Roku counterpart, as other reviewers have noted, however, it's not overwhelming and can be pretty helpful when searching.  Overall we are very happy with it.  We'll probably be purchasing another for the bedroom tv."
"1280","I am using this for Playstation Vue app and it works nicely.  It could be faster and navigation could be better, but for what I paid for and the value I received I cannot complain.  The Alexa voice option really comes in handy fast forwarding through movies.The only complaint I have is lag time when trying to access apps or navigate in apps.  It is annoying some times and I would have gladly paid more for more RAM to alleviate this issue."
"1281","I wasn't sure about getting a fire stick, but I'm so glad I decided to. I already had the Apple TV and didn't think I would have much use for the fire stick, but I was wrong. I like how easy it is to move from tv to tv. I also like that it has different options available to me that the Apple TV does not have. I also love that I can have Alexa find apps, shows, games, and movies. Definitely a good investment and it is much more affordable options than  the Apple TV. I'm so looking forward to buying the gaming controller next, my kids are definitely going to take over the tv the."
"1282","Great product, Amazon! Having a controller really sets it apart from something like a chromecast. You can still cast stuff from YouTube etc. Like you would with a chromecast, but it definitely isn't as intuitive."
"1283","The Fire TV Stick is awesome.  There are so many different applications, and the user interface is clean and easy to use. BUT, there is no way to adjust overhang on the 2nd version.  The screen gets cut off on all edges of my TV with no way to adjust it in the TV settings.  On the first gen Fire TV Stick, the screen size could be adjusted until the arrows lined up with the edge of the screen.  On this new stick, it is not possible to move the arrows, so the overhang can not be changed.  I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to remove this option from the first to the second generation.  For this reason I prefer the first generation stick."
"1284","I love my new firestick!  I finally have more control over what I get to watch on TV.  It is very easy to set up and use and Alexa can be very helpful. Being an Amazon Prime member certainly has its benefits!!!  Love all the available movies and series that are available.  I got hooked on Charlie Jade and had to watch the entire 20 episode season before moving on to something else.  Fire TV stick rocks!"
"1285","Purchasef my first for my late grandmother who was blind, I retrieved the unit and have watched countless prime video to the pount of obsession, now i hope my mother enjoys this as much as i do. Happy birthday to my mother. 11-29-1948"
"1286","We already have a Fire TV Stick so adding a Fire TV Stick with Alexa was fun.  Easy to use and Alexa works fine.  I have the Alexa app on my iPhone; the App and the Fire TV Stick (with Alexa) sync up nicely.  Fire TV Sticks are great!"
"1287","Fire stick set up quickly. As for the voice capability, I tried multiple times to get Alexa to understand what I wanted and it kept giving something else. I spoke clearly and slowly, still didn't work. Really like the stick otherwise."
"1288","Its everything they tell you it is and I'm about to cut the cabe. One problem: The remote is wonky. Sometimes clicking works and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes holding the button for a second works and sometimes it doesn't. Annoying."
"1289","love love LOVE this!! I prefer over my Roku, although the GUI could use some work, it's a little tedious ""scrolling"" to the right...but now that I think about it, Netflix has done the same thing. Either way, it's tedious. But the Fire Stick itself is AWESOME."
"1290","I use it when I go to school, and it's extremely useful. The university only has standard cable, so it's missing some shows we like to watch, which are available on Prime. Also great for Netflix. Ideal for college students especially because of easy setup...and you can order pizza with it.One star because it's advertised like you just plug it into the tv and go; didn't expect it to have to be plugged into the wall, too."
"1291","If I could, I would give this 2.5 stars. It's a great idea, but not ready for market. It streams poorly. I'm not even talking about Kodi, but the Amazon apps it gives you. There is frequent and sometimes lengthy pausing/buffering -- even though it says my wifi connect is ""very good"". It's trying to deliver HD, which at times it does well. It seems to me that it needs to automatically reduce resolution so buffering doesn't become an issue. But it doesn't do that. I think it's worth the $39 I paid for it, but don't cancel your cable subscription."
"1292","Bought one on the recommendation of a friend. We were so pleased with it we bought another for our second TV.  Easy to set up and use. We're enjoying watching the old Star Trek episodes and various mini-series we missed because they weren't on channels we subscribed to on cable. Worth every penny."
"1293","I love my new fire stick. I used to pay about $300.00 for cable/wi-fi/rental cable box fees, I now pay about $40.00 for wi-if, $10.00 for Netflix and $20.00 for sling tv. Plus, I can you tube for free on my firestick. That's a whole $230.00 savings monthly. I don't know about you, but I'm tired of earning my pay and giving it all away. My pockets are happier these days. Thank you inventor of firestick."
"1294","I have the Amazon TV and this is another add-on to my gadget collection!  I installed Kodi on this so now when I'm traveling I can watch all kinds of things (in addition to the normal Netflix, Hulu, etc...).  There's almost no noticeable performance differences between the stick and the FireTV.  Note that if you want to stream hi-def videos you'll need good internet connection (hotels usually limit the bandwidth).  The voice control is cool but I don't use it a lot other than checking news and weather, etc..  (Maybe someday I'll ask Alexa to order me some Chinese togo!!!).  I bought this over the BlackFriday so it was a good price"
"1295","I should have done this a long time ago but I was addicted to certain shows on cable but once I cut the cable cord I have been watching shows that I completely forgot about!  This was my best purchase ever this year.  Price is crazy low.  Thank you Amazon!"
"1296","I am not paid to review any products, I bought the fire tv stick to replace a PS3 I was using for streaming. I also bought this one because I have several Amazon products and love them, as I am technically challenged these products are idiot proof it makes installation and use in about 2 minutes out of the box."
"1297","Bought one few years ago, had been using it for a while until I lost the remote and using the phone app became too much pain (needs to recommend every time phone goes into standby/sleep).So I ordered this new one. It is MUCH faster than the older version. Didn't know what I was missing. Will probably upgrade every couple of years now. Totally worth it."
"1298","Works very well; gives me all the functionality of my old PS3 ""media center"", but is like 5% the size. It gives access to all the things, like HBO, Showtime, etc. (if you have accounts for them). I haven't had any problems with it."
"1299","Works great on our Vizio tv.  A few buggy things are annoying.  Ex. Sometimes a program you just watch doesn't show up in your ""recent"" videos and you need to search for them again.  It acts like a computer where it needs a few seconds to boot up or open a new app.  We use it for our Prime music which is super great, Prime videos, Hulu, Netflix and Sling TV.  It's a great vehicle to use for when you cut the cable company out of your budget like we did.  My wife didn't care for the voice search function Alexa but after using it, we really think it's handy.  Good product that we actually like better than the Roku platform which we also have."
"1300","I have read about reception issues with the Amazon fire TV stick.I also had some of the same problems. (My solution). I used the extenderIncluded with the package. It didn't help much. I then decided why not a longer extender so I tethered (2) six foot HDMI cables to thesystem and placed the stick 12ft closer to the modem and s high as possible. Problem solved. Also keep in mind that any walls or doorsbetween the modem and the fire stick will dampen the signal. Dont' forget this appiance is a (game changer) good luck.Amazon Jim"
"1301","The Fire Stick works better than expected. Streaming is far better than I get with a separate subscription with Netflix. Your on line ""selections"" pages, however, are mixed, jumbled and confusing. I thought, ""Sopranos"", was a Prime accessible series. Seems I was charged for what I watched trying to find the final episode. The episodes for sixth season seem to be mislabeled. Are there 20 episodes?Again, the selections that appear on the Fire Stick are confusing. Is this intentional? Please separate the ""Pay individual"" from the selections available and included with Prime membership.Thanks/Ralph"
"1302","I was pleasantly surprised by all the stuff this little HDMI stick can do. I received it for Christmas from my sister and was completely blown away by its capabilities. I was easily able to side load apps and videos, expand the memory with an external hard drive, and added Kodi. Having all my streaming (Netflix, Hulu, Prime, WatchESPN, HBO Go) apps easily accessible, plus personal videos, and Kodi on one device has made this one of the best Christmas gifts I have ever received. I had to retire my living room Chromecast to my teenage daughter's room after this upgrade (she only uses it for Spotify and Netflix). Highly Recommended!"
"1303","I really like our Fire TV and will probably go off of cable TV soon.  Great picture.  We have two in the house and this one is used to go from several different TV's in different rooms.  It works all the time and has a great picture."
"1304","I like that it steams from a lot of different channels but honestly it's a pain since I have to keep resetting it as it freezes every few days. My FIL has one too and it has no problems so four stars because maybe mine is just a dud."
"1305","the remote broke and amazon replaced it after trouble shooting it for me"
"1306","We're so completely in love with fire TV! It works extremely well!! We use it mostly for netflix, prime video, hulu, and youtube. The convenience of not having to hook up a laptop to HDMI is fantastic, and I'm so glad I decided to get this. Makes life a little more convenient."
"1307","I finally have come to the dark side.  I've resisted streaming for the longest time and now I don't know why.  The Fire TV Stick is easy to install and is very user friendly.  I have't played with the Alexa Voice yet... I'm still figuring out everything it can do.  I love it so much I bought a 2nd one so I don't need to move it from tv to tv."
"1308","We love Firestick! So happy not to be paying those high cable prices. We've not had one problem with it since we started using it about 5 weeks ago. A great bonus is the voice remote. It finds your shows easily and quickly.  We loved it so much, we ended purchasing on for our bedroom. Great item!"
"1309","Not being very technically inclined I'm sure it would do a lot more than I have used it for. Mainly purchased it so I could view my prime videos on tv.  It has done its job in that department. I personally have no reason to rate it less than five stars."
"1310","I have a second TV upstairs and don't have a cable subscription. I have Prime, netflix, hbo now, etc. I use an apple TV downstairs and wanted something for my upstairs TV. This Fire Stick was much cheaper than an Apple TV and I really like it. I haven't had a chance to use 100% of it's capabilities but setup was a breeze and it already knew it was for my prime account. I highly recommend this product."
"1311","I'm slowly cutting back on bills, and realized that I was paying a ton for cable channels that I don't watch, and a DVR box that I don't use, except for pausing shows and the clock :)This is the 2nd fire stick in my home.  It opens up tons of content, and with prime it's even better.  The one time cost will be recouped in the savings on my cable bill!"
"1312","The fire stick is very easy to put into operation and works flawlessly right out of the box.  It makes my viewing much more enjoyable and eliminates the annoyances I was experiencing with interrupted programs.  I recommend this item."
"1313","This is the bomb!  Goodbye cable TV bill.  Hello Alexa.  I can stream practically anything without buffering issues.  I have an ok smart TV.  This makes it a better TV.  But wait, there's more...I get to say ""Alexa, play  Mellow Instrumental Music"" into the remote mic, and Alexa says, ""Shuffling Instrumental Music (Playlist Name)"", in a nice, soothing voice.  On comes a selection from the millions of songs in Amazon Prime Library! Giving parties just got way easier. The remote is very easy to use.  This tech hardware feels very high-end and the Fire Stick functionality makes it a bargain.  Seriously just plug and play."
"1314","Use this to watch Amazon video and Netflix.  For some reason there is an issue with the hbo go and charter on the firestick.  I am able to use it on my xbox, but no worries.  Haven't had an issue with it and have had it for almost a year."
"1315","Unfortunately my product no longer works properly and the time it took to go through all of the hacks, and trial and error it has no warranty either.  It worked for about 2 weeks. It took 2 weeks just to figure out how to use it and add or remove apps. Nevertheless 30 days went by pretty quickly, and it hasn't worked since."
"1316","The stick didn't earn a 5 star review from me for one specific reason.  This is due to not being able to link it with the echo and use alexa without the remote to do searches and such as you can do with the remote.  Otherwise this product is awesome and the new layout of the home screen is the best I've seen so far.  Super simple to setup and works with my Harmony remote (minus the voice control).  Overall I'm very happy I just want to see amazon link their product lines together better than just baking Alexa into a bunch of different things as being designed by the same company they should be able to get them to work together."
"1317","I wouldn't have ever thought of getting one of these, but my recent ""cut the cable"" led to tons of research and questions to friends and VOILA, I ordered the Fire TV Stick.  While I am computer literate, I am NOT streaming TV literate.  The Fire Stick, however, doesn't require you to be.  The instructions for installation were SO simple and the on-screen instructions walked me through the rest.I can't tell you how pleased I am with the quality of the audio remote and the picture quality.  I'm already on the lookout for a USB TV for my bedroom so I can buy another one!"
"1318","For $10.99 a month, better than cable. Better than expected. Would recommend to others to ""break"" the cable connection & use Fire TV Stick. No antenna needed for local digital channels either! Just add the apps to the schtick!"
"1319","I've officially cut the cord did my research and after much calculating it made total sense. My family isn't he enough to watch cable and even if we were we never ever watched all the channels we had with our package, never used the dvr either it just didn't make any sense. The only thing we constantly use is the WiFi. I haven't had any issues with my firesticks, I have two, and there is tons of content. So I kept my Netflix and signed up for Amazon prime and we are never bored as a matter of fact we watch more movies now then we did before. I seriously recommend this item to anyone whose looking to cut the cord and save money."
"1320","The Fire Stick is Great!  Though my wireless provider Comcast are thieves and been charging me lord knows for how long 100mbps and only receive 25mbps what a rip.  So will take all my equipment back to Comcast and go with another provider"
"1321","I bought the stick for my mom and then I bought the box for myself. The stick worked but although i have blast speed internet (fastest internet by comcast) it was freeze a lot or would take a while to connect to the server. When i tried the box it worked much faster and barely ever froze. I would recomend the box over the stick. For a few extra bucks you can get something much better."
"1322","Very versatile, unbelievable number of channels available at amazon.com. The reason I like it more than the Chromecast I've been using is I can pair my bluetooth headset and listen to it without bothering others. The Alexa function is nice too, but they should let you know that to obtain full Alexa function you have to install it through your phone, otherwise it's capabilities are extremely limited. Since getting it I use it much more often than my Chromecast which has been delegated to only the things Fire TV Stick can't do. Buy it, you won't be disappointed. Cut the Cord."
"1323","We love it. It solved the problems we were experiencing and has enhanced our viewing choices, as well as the quality of the picture. My only complaint is the antennae cable is so short, it's hard to get a clear shot from behind the receiver in a cabinet."
"1324","What a dream what an answer to prayers what a gift where has it been! This device is great on for $40!!!and if you have prime!'nyou can go as far as your imagination. Movie night history night music playlist my house work gets done fasterThank you Amazon"
"1325","I like this very much gives me a different option to watch different shows good product"
"1326","There are several streaming devices available. I purchased it simply because we wanted to start using Sling TV. We used our daughters Roku stick. It did the job but thought the design look like a child's toy. I didnt like the delay in streaming at times. I researched the Firestick with Alexa on Amazon. It did everything we wanted with a a few extras compared to the basic Roku. Streaming is plefty fast for us. The storage is perfect. Over all, the Firestick with Alexa built in was a great value. It looks and fells nice too. I'd buy it again... Nice thing about it, I bought it with my Amazon store card. It was in my box in 2 days..Thank You Amazon..."
"1327","I'm satisfied , however, I haven't ubeen using it that much due to recovering from surgery I've been limited access to tv, but I'd like to take time to get to know this version and give a full review after more usage, if that's possible, bit if not for now I'm happy with my 2 sticks just need more time to explore it's capabilities and that's why only 4 stars and not 5, I need time to get to know it better"
"1328","I love it so far.  I am on a satellite system and it really bugs me when a storm causes an interruption of service, or there just isn't anything I'm interested in watching.  My Fire Stick allows me to have constant entertainment.  There are quite a few Amazon programs/series that I haven seen yet and am looking foreword to being able to see them anytime I wish.  And, I love the idea of being able to take it with me when I travel."
"1329","It's OK. I was disappointed with the selection that ACTUALLY COMES with the Stick.You have to be subscribed to many of the apps it DOES come with which kind of defeats the point of this thing, if you already have a smart T.V.The Stick is powered. Comes with some extra available memory.I have not had any issues with streaming and I use the Stick downstairs and my router is upstairs."
"1330","This is a great answer to my question of how to display Netflix on my older, non-wireless, TV.  Set up in 10 minutes.  Only problem was confusion on how to get to Netflix, which I already own (have to download from the cloud, then just say ""Launch Netflix"").  Note that this does require an HDMI port on your TV, so really old TVs may need some other kind of adaptor in addition to the Firestick.  You'll also need to know your home wifi and Netflix passwords."
"1331","Brought for my parents for Christmas. They love it. Easy to use easier than smart tv"
"1332","Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player I am enjoying the fire tv stick. However, I am disappointed that so many of the apps are only available by purchasing them. The service is ok."
"1333","It's pretty loaded with everything you need.  Setup is easy.  The only problem I encounrtered was reception.  You need it to stand off the TV and basically point straight out.  As soon as I did that I did not have further problems."
"1334","Not a very robust performer. Operating system gets bogged down quite easily from moderate use, most likely due to CPU/RAM limitations. Remote is decent, though limited in function. Audio/video quality is sufficient for price point."
"1335","Alexa firestick is 🔥!! I love the ease HOWEVER, some of the switching between shows and apps are confusing. My only reason giving 4 stars...I'm still setting up all my channels and shows.I do like voice command feature"
"1336","I wanted to ditch my cable and this was the way that worked for me. I can get the live sports I want (foootball and futbol). Plus I can pick from different packages that offer commercial free programming. Its almost a no brainer if you already have prime too since they throw in tons of great programming too. In the end I pay less than I did with Comcast for channels that I actually want and no commercials to boot. Cheers Fire Stick!"
"1337","We have 3 fire sticks and 2 fire tv! We are obsessed with all of them! LOve the easiness of installation and how it works in any room. We bought one to take on vacation with us when we go visit family(to keep the kids entertained)."
"1338","From the standpoint of the Fire app, it works just fine. However, be aware of one thing, the Alexa function does not work with the Echo or Echo Dot devices. The published description of the device does not make that clear distinction."
"1339","This is an excellent product. The packaging was well put together, and the instructions are simple yet effective. It took me about 30 seconds to get the battery cover off, because it sticks a little, and my fingers were slippery. I needed more traction, so a pair of rubber gloves (dish gloves) did the trick. One you plug in and connect the power adapter, boot up is staightforward.  I had the thing running in about 1 minute. The Alexa voice activated command structure is also simple to operate and very effective. Overall this is an excellent product and service, and with Prime, I think better than my Apple TV (1st generation)."
"1340","The Fire TV Stick is ok. I've had to unplug/plug it back in at least twice a day as it gets hung up and gives me Error 40. I was told to delete the DirectvNow app and reload it. It's easier to unplug the stick, wait a minute, and plug it back in. Rather aggravating but it could be my internet connection. Received the stick with the DirectvNow promotion, which I am previewing. Where is the Time Warner app? Oh, wait, it's on Roku. It would be nice to help the consumer and have all tv apps (Time Warner, DirectvNow, Sling, PlaystationVue, etc.) on all streaming devices, Of course, it's not on my LG 4K UHD (not so)Smart tv either."
"1341","The Fire TV box and stick are fantastic. I've become, like many people, very frustrated with the cost of cable/satellite, the limited choices of movies and sometimes also the pixilated and poor quality of the picture and sound. The Fire TV products now give me access to thousands of movies and some great series at my fingertips through Amazon. I happen to be a prime member.  Also the ease of use of the Amazon Fire TV is great, just plug it into your HDMI port and you are set for use. The quality of picture and sound are excellent. I highly recommend Five TV, I'm thinking of getting rid of cable and saving myself that expense."
"1342","This does it all. Love it so much I bought one for each of my home TVs and another for our camp trailer, so we can stream TV program in the camp grounds."
"1343","Thanks to the Fire TV Stick, I'm just about to divorce my local cable company.  For the cost of the monthly subscriptions on the Fire Stick, I can keep the same local cable channels AND save money.  The device is very easy to use, and setup took less than 2 minutes.  Definitely worth the money."
"1344","I finally realized just how lazy I/we've become as a society.  Its a sad commentary when we've gotten to the point where we're too lazy to use a remote to change TV channels and have to resort to using verbal commands to change channels ! ! !"
"1345","Husband loves this! He got it for Christmas, and now he won't leave the bedroom LoL He has his own TV in there and is always on Amazon Prime watching movies and series. Great investment, especially for those who already have Prime."
"1346","We are loving our Fire Stick.  Slight learning curve in learning how to navigate through it, but overall we are pleased.  Would suggest to anyone who wants to cut the cable/satellite strings but want a little more options than over the air broadcasts."
"1347","This has been an absolute life saver! It works great and does really all I need to. Only complaint is with software (which hopefully upgrades) you can use the voice control to type info inside of apps (say searching titles inside Netflix). Otherwise super awesome and would but another in a heart beat"
"1348","fire stick pretty decent.  don't care for alexa voice.  doesn't work all that great.  the fire stick seems to be responsive.  like there is alot of app options like the roku.  little annoyed with the netflix app being i have to select profile every time i start it.  that does't happen with other devices.  overall, good price and good functionality.update 11/27/16.  i'm loving the ability to modify this device.  being able to sideload apps like google music and kodi media player has made of the best device i've used before.  that wouldn't be possilbe if it wasn't running android.  i would definately recommend over the roku and chromecast devices."
"1349","I. Do. Not. Miss. Cable.  This is the neatest thing ever.  We have 4 of them in our household and it's just amazing everything this Firestick can do.  I've read blogs and posts on social media before purchasing these and they are all right, best thing ever and worth the money. Besides all of the available apps, you can also ask Alexa to find the nearest pharmacies, grocery stores, Italian restaurants, the weather, etc.  You can tell Alexa to add stuff to your To-Do List and Shopping List. You can play your playlists from Prime music.  You can continue watching your shows on Netflix from the living room tv to your bedroom tv, if both are hooked up with the Firesticks, of course. You can set up your phone or tablet as a remote and switch between Firesticks and control all of them from one device, should you have more than one.  We have an 11 year old Netgear  Wi-Fi router in our 1800 Sq ft home, and not one time have we had any issues with all of our many tablets, computer, laptop, cell phones and the 4 Firesticks using this one router. The remote itself is a nice size for the hand and I can see it getting lost because it is smaller than most tv remotes.  Other than that little issue, best technology for home."
"1350","I have already ordered about five amazon TV fire sticks as gifts.  I ordered this one for my niece. the amazon TV fire stick works great.  has more than any of the satellites or dish type networks.  I discontinued my subscription to DISH."
"1351","This device has been saving me $300 a month. Upon receiving and I have disconnected my cable and I have no regrets. Although I do not live in the United States the few Amazon movies that I can watch in my country are worth it. Of the following one of the reviewers simple a device I downloaded Kodi and now I can watch whatever I want whenever I want at my leisure the quality is excellent. My only regret is that I did not purchase a firestick sooner I will most definitely be purchasing another one in the future."
"1352","I am impressed with this little device, it has save my family over $200.00 a month. Be advised by adding services like Hulu, Showtime, HBO, and Netflix, you may find yourself with a substantial bill, even though you own your fire stick."
"1353","We've gotten rid of cable completely, and have been without it for the past 3 years and will never look back. I've suggested these to literally everyone I know, sometimes even strangers. The new fire stick with the alexa voice remote is a bazillion (it's a real number I swear) times faster than the previous version, these are super convenient to have and very cost effective. 33,000 reviews exist for this reason. If you're here looking for a solution to get rid of cable, you've found it. Don't waste your time or money on roku boxes, chromecasts, or any of those other devices, the fire stick offers everything they do and more."
"1354","Works great, I think the apple tv is easier to navigate but that is probably because I have other apple products.  However the Fire Stick is much less expensive and really does the same things as the apple tv.  I would purchase another Fire stick."
"1355","Like other reviews I've read....wish I woild've cut the cable cord long ago! Cannot tell the diff between cable & Sling TV! Live TV is exactly! Been cable free for a week & cannot even tell. And I LOVE tv. Here & there the connection may stop but its literally back in secs. Saving me $100+ mo! Crazy. Have the stick in my bedroom & bought Amazon TV for my living room. Cannot tell the diff there either. Although looks like you can plug in other things, like an earthnet to the TV. Overall great purchase!!"
"1356","This fire stick exceeded our expectations for turning our old TV into a ""smart"" TV! Even our 5 year old can run it. The only downfall is it appears to be pretty easy to purchase shows, movies, etc. so I has to add a passcode when we enter an app. It would be handy if you could choose which apps you apply the passcode to. Still an awesome investment for a very reasonable price!"
"1357","I have this, roku stick and a regular fire tv.  This is my least favorite. I don’t have problems with content freezing or skipping on the other two devices but I have it with this. Definitely going refer roku over this, hands down."
"1358","This item has some issues. I give it a 5 for ease of setup. It pretty much sets itself up. I can't get Alexa to work.  Every time I ask it something (and, yes, I am saying Alexa first) the only response is I don't understand.  I got this because I wanted to watch shows on CW and have recently dropped cable.  It's also quirky in that it doesn't always load whatever I want to watch on the first try. I hit the load button. It pauses like its loading then loads home. If I try again I get my show.  The apps are annoying. Most of them require you to have cable OR cost. If I had cable I wouldn't have bought the fire stick. So I'm rating this average."
"1359","i used this firestick in my kitchen because i gave up cable and the signal was poor to marginal so it kept going off and on during a show. I needed to get an amplifier to boost me wifi signal. Easy setup, no problem. I wished i could use Siri during the setup but i had to do everything manuel."
"1360","I Had previous version.I also purchased the Fire T.V. which  is amazingly nice!This one is very good upgrade from the first Fire stick,The menus load quickly and almost as well as The Fire T.V.Box !  The voice remote is amazing with an Amazon prime account ! Those Who use Kodi. Kodi is much more responsive even though it still has 1Gig of ram.I Think this has to do with The first gen stick allocating half of the 1 gb of ram to video and leaving only 512 mb of ram to run system itself!1GB (512MB system, 512MB video)The new stick lets you use the full 1 gb of ram to run the system,making it way more responsive and well worth the money ."
"1361","Absolutely love this! All my apps work much better, I have noticed that Hulu works much better through this. It is a lot faster and I have no problem it going to a next episode by itself if I am binge watching! The voice control with my Alexa works perfect. Again LOVE IT!"
"1362","Vey good product.  I ended up ordering two.  The came quickly and on time.  The instructions were ieasy to follow and the coice command is cery easy ans convenient to use.  I would definitely recommend that you purchase this item."
"1363","The firestick is the absolute best streaming device on the market. The stick is portable and quick to install. Get a wireless cord and you don't even need an outlet. We have two of these and I'm going to start giving them away as gifts."
"1364","This is wonderful. I was having a problem with my wifi reaching throughout the house. We had to have an ethernet cable put in to have cable to the TV across the house. It is a smart TV but doesn't have many apps. I was amazed that when I attached the Fire Stick it worked immediately and there were alot of wonderful apps. I recommend this product without hesitation. I personally am thrilled and I can take it with me on vacation!"
"1365","Oh my-my-my what do we have here? I LOVE IT! Time I hooked it up it was like love at first sight! I'm so glad I went ahead and got one. My cable bill was running me almost $300 a month including the internet. So this will be a tremendous savings. Not to mention being a prime member gives you exclusive movies and shows. I will be purchasing another one for my living room at the end of the month. I'm now an ecstatic and happy Fire Stick member :)"
"1366","It was super easy to hook up. Stressless getting it connected to my wifi (unlike the echo dot). Taught my husband how to use it correctly in ten minutes. I purchased an antenna to pick up my local stations. BUT the best thing of all is now there is no cable box in that room and my cable bill is $55 lower. If there was a way to get FNC live I could cut the cord completely.Extremely happy with this purchase."
"1367","I have two new sticks and the bigger one for 4K streaming.  All are great!  No need for cable with this and DirecTV Now.  I have more channels without it than I did with it for less $.  Plus, not being tied to cable jack locations is nice.  Get it."
"1368","I bought this so I could install Kodi on it.  Between Kodi and the Terrarium TV app, there is a tremendous amount of TV and Movie content available.  I'm very pleased with it, and am looking to purchase a second Fire TV Stick for my other TV."
"1369","Come on very fast, since having the stick I had one problems with it but other than that little problem the stick works great. It picks up everything when you are using the microphone that takes you to whatever you trying to find."
"1370","I definitely like this one better than the first one... No one in our home liked using the older one... I gave it away... This one is easy to use and things load up a lot faster... We'll probably buy another one for the bedroom..."
"1371","I love the on-screen interface for the FireTV. I've always been an Apple TV user, but this gives it some serious competition. I appreciate that I can finally watch all of my Prime Video tv shows. The voice remote makes it incredibly easy to search for something. Keep it up, Amazon! You are slowly winning me over."
"1372","This little thing is great.  I purchased one to give my aging father something to watch.  Since then I have purchased two more for myself.  All of my TV's are smart TV's.  I now use the fire instead of the smart TV function.  The fire is incredible fast.  And easier to use the my SmartTV.  And my Smart TV is easy to use."
"1373","I picked this up during Amazon's Black Friday sale. I've had Prime for a little over a year now and do watch a lot of the Prime TV, but have always watched via a laptop (and then I'd Airplay to my TV.) It isn't the most optimal situation, so for $30 I figured I'd give this a shot. All I can say is I wish I'd bought one sooner. The interface is pretty standard and can require a lot of clicking (no way around that), but what really sold me is the built-in Alexa. I love being able to just tell it what show I want to watch and it starts right up. Pausing, fast forwarding/rewinding, jumping to the next episode- it's so easy. Love it!"
"1374","Easy to install and set up.  Love being able to give voice commands to find shows.  I use my Dot for music so don't with this.  Now I just wish The Expanse 2nd season was Prime!  Finding shows I really want to see using this tool."
"1375","But...I can't help but wonder if it would be possible to allow owners to change the queues around.  I love the fire stick, but putting it to sleep is one of the more frequent things I do and I find it hard to believe that I have to go through so many various choices, particularly in the 'settings' queue before reaching the sleep function."
"1376","I recommend to anyone that doesn't have cable/satellite service. I was reluctant to buy at first but a friend insisted I couldn't go wrong with the amazon fire stick. I'm a happy customer."
"1377","We got rid of our cable a couple months ago & solely use the firestick & we love it!!! I can't lie, I miss cable a little bit, but this makes the burn not so bad. It is quick, easy & convenient to find all the apps & shows we watch."
"1378","The idea is good, to cut the cord; however to use most (all) of the channel apps you have to either pay or have a cable subscriber username/password to watch any of the shows. Furthermore, some of the apps do not seem to work well and keep crashing or are constantly buffering which makes watch ""live tv"" a pain in the ass. This does work really well with Amazon Prime videos - for which again you are paying.I do like being able to ask alexa to find me a movie, means I don't have to search through all the apps to find it. And then I do get to choose which app I want to use for watching, which is also nice."
"1379","I love it. I have an AppleTV (my go-to streaming box), I have a Roku (hated it), and now I have a the Fire Stick. The simple fact I was able to put KODI on the stick without having to jailbreak it, put it above AppleTV. I have yet to use the AppleTV since getting the stick. I absolutely love it. Plus, being able to watch Grand Tour without streaming from my iPhone is awesome.If you don't have an interest in adding KODI, and already have another streaming device, I'm not sure if I would buy this. It's redundant. But if you want a cheap streamer that will allow you to easily add KODI - do it. You won't regret it!"
"1380","I just received this product yesterday. For months we have been using our XBOX 360 to play Netflix in our bedroom at night, so we never really got to play on it. Bought this to replace it so we could put the XBOX back in the living room, and I love it more than I expected! Setup took only about 5 minutes and now we can watch all of our favorites with the click of a button. The Alexa voice feature on the remote makes it easier than ever to look up specific movies and shows on all the platforms. Being able to access Amazon Prime videos is really cool too, since now there's even more to choose from. Timely delivery, great product! 😊"
"1381","Was a surprise gift when I mentioned to someone that I needed to replace my aging Sony unit. The functionality is far faster and smoother, and the OS when not actually using an App is does a very good job of helping you keep track of what you've been doing via visual features.The included short HDMI extension is great! If you hook more than one item to your TV and/or the HDMI ports are relatively close, this is a must have/use!Don't care much for the voice bit."
"1382","Done got me myself a garsh darn smart tv now. Shoot howdy!! Seriously, for the money this is a fantastic investment. All my Amazon movies and music at my fingertips is just awesome. Netflix, Hulu, etc... as well make this a 5 star purchase. Set-up was a breeze. Intuitive voice control is a game changer too. Until I get my 55"" ultra hd smart tv, I do believe this product will serve as a wonderful substitute."
"1383","Purchased this for my father. I already have one and use it daily.  My father is in his early 80s and just loves all that he can watch on it. He is mostly a news person but is loving it. I just installed it for him this past weekend. I added a few of the apps for him for him to try out."
"1384","This is a great replacement for those people who are tired of paying so much for TV every month! The Fire TV Stick lets you download all the apps and programs you need to watch TV (including Netflix, Hulu, PS Vue, etc.) without the high price of cable or satellite. Well worth the money!"
"1385","I love this! I use it for my Beachbody on Demand workouts.  I can carry it to use other places when I travel.  I love the apps and Alexa is a fav at our house.  There are so many things included with it, I still have not found it all. Very good purchase...I would recommend it to anyone."
"1386","Easy to assemble & install, plus very nicely priced. Alexa works well as does the streaming & wi-fi, perhaps obviously.I had a little trouble figuring out how to switch from my Fire TV Stick back to my cable service & vice versa; operator error?"
"1387","Received it the same day it came out. I mainly bought it because I have kids and they constantly mess with the remote to the tv or PlayStation I had in there; which in turn makes me have to stop doing laundry or cooking dinner. So far it was a 5 minute set up with a super simple remote and download of a few of my apps like NetFlix and Hulu. Then they were watching tv seamlessly. I happen think it streams tv faster than my old PS3 and has a better picture too. So far I am very please with it and ordered another for my main TV room because I am learning more about the add on apps like Kodi and some of its great features for streaming other channels."
"1388","This was super easy to set up and the interface is user friendly.  I'm a little put off by the difference in available choices listed on Prime videos compared to when I access Prime from my PS4.  There seems to be significant number of available stand up programs missing my Comedy Central subscription, but there are Comedy Central series on the fire stick.  I expect my available choices to be constant no matter what device I connect with.  For that reason, I'm giving it a 4 star."
"1389","I only gave it 4 stars since the instructions for set-up were horrible. No where did it say your tv had to be turned on to a different setting for it to work! I had it ready to return when I finally found a person on line that happened to mention it in language I understood. Amazons help site did not help me obviously. It is working now."
"1390","The remote barely works. I don't understand how a brand new remote can be so faulty.Edit: I was contacted by Amazon and after some failed troubleshooting, they sent me a new controller. New controller works great but it does use batteries pretty quickly."
"1391","I am in love with the Fire TV Stick!  I wanted to be able to watch Netflix and HBO Now from the bedroom TV but didn't want a bunch of bulky stuff hanging on the wall.  The stick took no time at all to set up and I have yet to have an issue with it.  I can access everything I want to and THEN some.  Only downside is now I can binge watch shows right from bed."
"1392","I needed an affordable device that can run KODI to accept video streams. This turns on when the TV does and is set to start directly into KODI. I'm then able to play videos from YouTube - including the live steam TO YouTube that I'm running a few doors down."
"1393","Hope Amazon read this cause the need to make the Echo and Dot be able to control the Fire TV stick. That's the only thing I've found wrong with this so far. My wife and I bought two of these to replace our Chrome Casts they are way better work much smoother and have many more features. On thing you will miss out on between this and the Chrome Cast is that you can steam things from different internet pages (or I don't know how yet). That is to say I have to be a supported steaming service to play on this where as the Chrome Cast you could cast anything from a phone or tablet which was allowed to be cast the Google Chrome."
"1394","The first one of these I connected was for my 8 year old granddaughter.  She LOVES it.  For the price of this and a 35.00 controller, she will get as much enjoyment out if this as she would a Playstation.  :)  She is not enough of a gamer to spend that money.  This works!"
"1395","We canceled cable and now use the fire TV stick and an antenna for our TV viewing."
"1396","My daughter and husband love this mainly because they can watch YouTube on our big screen TV, including our own YouTube channel. My 17-month old daughter's favorite TV is Ann TV -- that is all the videos we've ever taken of her."
"1397","I love this thing it's so easy to use and set up. With Chromecast I have to have a tablet or a phone but with this everything is just there. The only thing I am sorry about when it comes to my fire stick is not getting it sooner"
"1398","Great price for the fire stick. Very easy to use. Excellent packaging and nothing was damaged. Every item was individually wrapped up. Easy installation right into the back of the television into the USB port. Easy set up instructions as well."
"1399","This version of Fire TV Stick has performed well thus far, even with a not so stellar internet connection. The menu is also improved. The previous version dropped the connection so frequently I gave up and tossed it in a drawer."
"1400","Awesome!!! Not to mention I no longer have to pay the rip off cable company to watch television. However, sometimes it stalls or takes a while buffering. Might be the cable company's internet service trying to frustrate me. Lol."
"1401","Great product and have had no issues with it so far. Only reason I didn't rate it 5/5 is because there are no USB ports nor other methods of expanding memory, restricting the user to only Amazon Prime content. Other than that, very good."
"1402","Works exactly as described. I was able to access my Netflix account within minutes of plugging it in. I do not live in the United States, so sone content is inaccessible, however it's working wonderfully with my hd tv for what I want it to"
"1403","Works just fine.  Wish I didn't need 3 remotes though - one for cable provider, one for TV (to change the ""source""), and now one for Fire stick.  But so far, we're enjoying the access to some movies and TV that we weren't getting otherwise."
"1404","We use PS Vue for our ""cable"" subscription.  The Fire TV Stick allows us to watch the PS Vue subscription with an almost identical interface to the PS4 on our TV.  This was not the case with our Roku.  This makes it super easy to use, essentially plug and play.  We LOVE it! It's not bulky, and is extremely portable.  Love being able to move it from room to room very simply."
"1405","Listen up:Usually to gain access to HBO, Cinemax, or whatever, you need to have basic cable or sat service- between this and equipment fees, its usually about $120 before any HBO or whatever.With Fire you have a one time acquisition fee of about $40; then you can buy HBO for I think $14 per month, or buy a show or a season, totally a la carte. Even if you load up on all pay channels, you'd be way less than any cable or sat service. All you need is high speed internet. This is one of the best consumer products I've seen in 30 years...very awesome. Buy it and cancel your TV service only, not internet...."
"1406","Had to have my son-in-law set this up for me - I'm not set up smart on these things.  He did an awesome job getting apps for me and showing me how to use it.  As I watched him set it up I knew then it would have been impossible for me to have been able to do it myself.  WOW it is amazing once it's set up.  And of course, my grandson took it and browsed through and immediately was able to start navigating and playing movies (like grandma this is so easy) and said ""I think we need to get one of these too!""I really like it and it really is amazing  and i'm getting the hang of it the more I use it.  I love it!"
"1407","Love this little device and the Alexa feature truly is AWESOME.  I am a Prime user, have Netflix and am looking into getting Sling TV. Yes, I am on my way to cutting the cord.  I have used it many times and it works much better than my android box.  I have not really had any buffering issues and I can still go up a level on my internet service.  Netflix works well as does Prime using the voice control (LOVE IT!).  I HIGHLY recommend this device.  I will be purchasing more for additional TVs in my home.  I am SO looking forward to saying goodbye to cable for good and this is a great option! And you can't beat the price!!"
"1408","Real easy set up.  It's not like streaming 'cuz it's so fast.  Voice works well,  I love it !!"
"1409","This streaming device is really great, and works mostly as advertised. It's ridiculously inexpensive, so this is my cord-cutting go to. Yes you can use Kodi, and add all of your ""probably illegal"" add-ons. More importantly to me, my 5-year old daughter can navigate through with ease to her Netflix profile, and my tech un-savvy wife navigates just as well. I reduced the star because:1. The app marketplace is not very search friendly2. The audio digitizes if the app cache gets too big, and there's no working around it."
"1410","So far a great experience! We've only had it a few days, but between the Alexa voice feature (only seems to work with the Amazing app and switching apps),  the ease of use of the remote, and the great interface were thrilled.We've had Roku, which we like, and Samsung Smart Hub (which we had to buy this because it's so poorly designed). Roku is good, but so far this is even better. Couldn't be happier.So easy and intuitive. Plus I can download another way to use app remote for my phone which also helps in typing in text boxes for usernames, etc...Great! I want to try more Amazon home items now!"
"1411","Easy to set up an use. Alexa is great!update: if you are buying these as gifts and you have an amazon prime account.  Make sure you deregister the devices before you give them away.  They come already hooked up to your account and if they person makes purchases to extra channels like HBO or STARZ, they are automatically going on your card.  Lesson learned.  Amazon was great about refunding the money and helped me deregister them."
"1412","I Love this fire stick! so user friendly. I have been so impressed, my son bought it for me  Christmas 2016  my husband hooked it up and I am off and running, so easy to use. My husband wanted the Google box which I got him for christmas 2016, 5 months later he is still trying to figure it out. So if you want something that works perfect and so easy to use then get this fire tv stick. I am a verified purchaser, I purchased and my son paid me. I 100% recommend this Fire TV stick"
"1413","We mainly use for streaming Prime/Netflix, but you can also mirror a screen and all sorts of other apps and functions on it. Replaced a standalone DVD unit and it is completely hidden behind the TV, so it also tidied up the area. Would definitely buy for other TVs/rooms."
"1414","I bought the old fire stick early last year.  I loved it so much, I recently bought one for each of my television sets.  I also had my daughter to purchase two.  The stick does what it says.  I am not confined to cable tv anymore.  I plan to add an attennna and cancel my cable altogether.My only problem is that the home screen for two of my sticks are different from the home screen of the other two.  Although I have searched the internet, I have yet to find instructions as to how to ungrade the home screens so that they are all consistent.  If anyone has a suggestion, please let me know.Love the Fire Stick!"
"1415","It's by far better than Apple TV (2nd generation). Menus are quick and overall unit works well.  Very easy to navigate.  The drawbacks so far are 1. It's recommended to plug the stick with the supplied power cord. 2. If you have a subscription to HBO via your cable provider, you will not have access to amazon channel of hbo. It's a separate service to hbo go.  Same goes with their other premium subscription service. I thought it would be easier to use the firestick to streamline viewing but no.  I almost lost all interest in the stick now because of this.  It's only been a couple of weeks.  Still giving it a go though."
"1416","Got this with my sign up for DirecTV Now which is also pretty slick.  Have used a ps3 and Roku previously.  This was very easy to get up and running and is working very well.  Voice commands are neat but the remote buttons are easy.  The stick is plugged into the back of the TV so it doesn't create any clutter and and so far I have had zero problems with the remote working properly.  Recommended."
"1417","Chromecast convert here. Great versatile device. Add Kodi and your world is limitless. My only reason for 4 stars is the ridiculous wait to buy these. With such an in demand device, from a company with huge profits and billions of $ , why do they have such a supply chain deficit."
"1418","Very handy to have on my dumb TV. Lots of useful apps and absolutely great of you like streaming from any popular streaming services. Added game apps are a nice little bonus. The included remote and comfortably low price set this world's appart from other streaming devices I have used. Even if you do not have a prime membership you will not be disappointed with this.The only con is that on some 720p TV's it will force upscale to 1080. It still looks ok and doesn't hinder operation or visability but it would be nice to have a manual option for resolution."
"1419","Bought it at Best Buy and once hooked up it flutters the whole time durning set up and continued. Was unable to watch a complete movie without it starting at the beginning. Returned it waiting for a replacement for over a week."
"1420","We basically bought this to allow us to enjoy our streaming programs while travelling.  It was simple to set up, and worked great on our first trip.  It has other features that we haven't even explored yet.  Recommend it highly."
"1421","I just started using this so I haven't even begun to discover everything that it does but it was easy to install and start using right out of the box.  I love the voice remote because it saves me from bouncing around trying to find what I'm looking for.  If you have a movie in mind you want to see just say it and there it is!  Particular genre of music...again just say what it is you want and Alexa will find it."
"1422","I got this a few days and ago and have been using it.  I'm a little dissappoint charter spectrum doesn't support apps like NBC Sports watch ESPN.I also wish the controls for playing programs was a little more intuitive."
"1423","I took down the satellite dish, bought the stick and haven't looked back. Quite happy with sling TV, Amazon Prime and Netflix. All you need is a semi decent internet connection. Great product, easy setup, excellent picture quality."
"1424","I really like this device. It's so easy to find shows and movies to watch. However, I read that I could use my echo device to control the fire stick. I used my Alexa app to connect to the fire stick. It shows my device, but when I try to use my echo device to control the tv, it says I either don't have enough power or my device is not connected to the wifi. Also, Amazon devices do not have Vudu so I am unable to watch my ultraviolet movies with the fire stick. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars."
"1425","Really great item! The firestick installs in minutes and the remote works well. The remote itself is sleek and small, although because if the small size it is easy to lose. I love the Alexa feature And my kids like to show off how cool it is to their friends! It's s very easy to navigate through prime and a must have!"
"1426","Significantly more responsive than FireTV Stick 1, Plex is very useable, voice remote works well.  Seems to have higher power needs than v.1, so get more warnings when connected to TV USB connections than before, though still works great."
"1427","While I love the access and ease of the Fire Stick, I HATE how much data it uses! We had no idea that our internet had a data limit, until we got a Fire Stick. Now we only use it for shows that we can't get using Netflix/Amazon on our Wii (ABC, HGTV, FOX Now, etc.). Pretty disappointed, as the purpose was to get rid of the Wii, but we couldn't afford that now."
"1428","Comes with HDMI extender cable and USB power cable. Easy to setup. My Smart Blu-Ray player was dropping channels from its line-up and that was aggravating. The Fire TV Stick had those channels and more. After setting it up I selected my apps and activated them from my computer. Fire TV Stick even has free apps (relaxation, yoga, etc.)."
"1429","I plugged the fire stick in the tv it did not recognized the remote tv told me to put new batteries in the remote and try again I did that still did not work,  So frustrated, could not get it to work after unplugging everything and starting over, so call customer service to help me.  They stay on the phone with me till I got it working.Thank you Amazon Customer Service."
"1430","The way I look at it, it's about par with the Chromecast which I consider to be the most similar competitor product. It's does no more, and slightly less as far as screen casting abilities. I was going to buy a new Chromecast soon anyways and this kinda replaced it's duties so it worked out. Video quality kinda seems a little better but it might just be me wanting a little more out of it. It has a menu interface and remote which some may find value in but I'm so used to using my phone as a remote that it makes no difference with me. Comes in handy if you want to play simple games on it like flappy bird or crossy frog."
"1431","Firesticks are great I really don't know what else to say,  you can't go wrong getting one.  Set it up how you want it so it suits your needs."
"1432","Fire TV stickLove it.  Works perfectly.  Works very fast and it great to own,  My friends are all jealous."
"1433","Works great. I have a Roku as well and prefer the fire stick over it. Highly recommend.The smart phone app remote is terrible."
"1434","I have so much trouble with it that am not sure if I want to use it. I have other devices and work great but the stick, just don't think I like it. I replace the first one because it came a big hassle setting it up and hard time downloading Apps. Second one better but has issues when I open an App keep getting a time connection time out. I have a pretty good network and this is the only device with an issue."
"1435","This is a great and very affordable alternative to cable. I bought one of these for each of my TV's, but you can also simply move this device from TV to TV. I even take it with me when I travel. As long as internet is available, and the TV has a HDMI port you are good to go!  I HIGHLY recommend it. A subscription to Amazon prime, Hulu or Netflix is suggested to increase programming options. Goodbye overpriced and overrated satellite and cable TV! With our new digital antenna and Fire TV stick, we have all the viewing options we need and about an extra $100 smackeroo's a month in our pocket!"
"1436","This couldn't be easier to install and use! It replaced a Sony media player that was constantly spooling, required a complicated set up and was a really inferior product. I just love the Fire Stick - and, it's portable! Well done, Amazon!"
"1437","Let me first say, I love the fire stick. Love it. So many viewing options! I had one, lost the remote when I moved, so unfortunately I had to buy a new one. It was late November right after Black Friday, this brand new version came out, so I was excited to try it. Voice remote (haven't become adept at this yet - it doesn't seem as intuitive/responsive as it needs to be), better wifi signal capability, sounds great, right? Wrong!The signal is incredibly and frustratingly inconsistent. Even with the wifi extender attached. In an APARTMENT. We have no issues with our other devices. It will sometimes shut down in the middle of a movie. Rare, but it happens.What happens most frequently is that it will come on, you think you're about to select an app or watch a show, and you get the dreaded blue screen. Now it has to reboot. Great. Get back to the home screen, select whatever, shuts down. Over. And over. And over. And over and over and over until I'm furious and my toddlers are screaming because they can't watch Dino Dan or Finding Dory or whatever their latest obsession is.The whole point of this device is to stream shows on a tv. And what am I doing? Watching Netflix on my phone because I don't want to mess with the fire stick and the ""will it or won't it work"" saga. 😭Help."
"1438","So this is my first time with the Fire TV. The system itself works really well with Prime Video. I also use it Apple TV so I flip back and forth because I have purchased movies on ITunes.  The one feature I'd love Fire TV to have is a volume control. For no apparent reason Apple TV controls my TV volume even though I never set it up and its awesome like that. Fire TV could use that and it would become a 5 Star. The control also feels cheap plastic... Not to be disparaging but it looks and feels like cheap controller. The Echo doesn't look or feel that way. That is all."
"1439","HUGE FAN! We were already sold on Alexa, but now she's in my TV remote.... WHAT!?! Yep, mind is now blown. I love seeing my 4 year old grab the remote and tell her to play Kids Bop! Plus its connected to the surround sound receiver so we have daily dance parties! Bought 2 on Black Fri. for $35/ea. Probably going to get more as we're moving them around the house now... I know way too many TVs but we're typical lazy Americans with too many TVs. We previously had the Roku, Chromecast, and Smart TVs, the FireStick blows them all away. Plus she helps ""Mommy/Daddy Play Time"" when I ask her to play our wedding song!"
"1440","My wife and I and the kids love this item... Netflix, Hulu, and  our favorite Amazon Prime Movies all in the palm of your hand puts an end to saying, "" There""s nothing to watch on TV.. Oh, I almost forgot, all of your favorite music with Amazon Prime. We have purchased many items from Amazon, but I would  have to say that this has been the best item for the entire family, And the Alexa voice remote allows you to view the film you want just by SAYING THE NAME OF THE SHOW.  At under $40.00, this would have to be the best gift of this Holiday Season. Keep the great deals coming and we'll be customers for life..."
"1441","My daughter finally talked me into moving into the 21st century as she puts it. This works so well that we are dropping our satellite tv provider and going with Hula, netflicks and prime at a considerable yearly savings to us."
"1442","got to pay for everything i wanted it for. only thing i can use it for is getting the best out of prime....but i didnt get prime for the tv, i got it for the shipping. maby i will like it more when i travel away from the dish that has what i want on it already. moral of the story, nothings free."
"1443","Delivered ahead of projected delivery date, easy to install per enclosed instructions, just follow the directions in plain English. The unit connected easily to my wifi router and as easily to my existing Netflix account.  I'd buy this agai!"
"1444","This is so much faster and user friendly then the last gen firestick. the Gui makes more sense, stuff isnt buffering or glitchy all the time (im guessing the upgrade to ac wifi has something to do with that). and fun fact, you can actually mirror your windows 10 laptop to your tv!  only downside is no where to attach storage to the sucker, though there may be a convoluted work around to that.or i could just get a fire tv.anyway, would buy again!"
"1445","This works very well.  My apt wouldn't let me get satellite and cable was more expensive, so I decided to try this route.  I purchased a subscription to Hulu thru this and am more than happy with the results!  I get most of my channels (lacking hallmark) for a lot less than any of the other providers.  The voice remote is also fun to play with.  The only thing I wish this came with was a way to link it to my TV so it would turn it on and turn up the volume."
"1446","I'm still figuring out how to work it, but so far I love it.  The fire stick is the perfect solution for my non-smart TV to get the streaming services I subscribe to (Netflix & Hulu). The only thing that I found disappointing is that there's no Vudu of Fandango app, so I can't watch the movies I've already purchased."
"1447","After we cut the cord we bought two streaming devices for two different TVs and with the devices came two types of remotes. After using the other remote we found the Fire Stick to be superior, so we bought another Fire's Stick for our other TV and now the other streaming device's remote has been placed in the drawer."
"1448","We got the fire stick on a recommendation and were excited to use it, then came the hassle. No directions on how to use the thing. Set up was a night mare and we finally had to get one of our kids to set it up. That was the disappointing thing. Getting to watch movies and TV shows with no commercia has made it worth it now that we know what we are doing ."
"1449","We have enjoyed this so much. We can watch so many movies and shows. It's great. Worth every penny. I was tired of paying about $80 a month on dish. And now we only pay for Internet and we can watch everything we used to and more much more."
"1450","Love it . I cant get Fox news live its me not knowing how to work it yet. Easy to set up and its looks like my tv has a better picture now. I will call customer service to see what i am doing wrong by not getting Fox news live."
"1451","I'm an Apple TV user testing the waters of other offerings. The Fire TV is comparable in some ways, but in one, key way, it really falls short: The remote. It's bad. And it doesn't offer volume control. But since the remote does Fire TV specific things, using a 3rd party universal remote is also not reasonable. So you're stuck with 2 (or more) remotes. The Apple TV has the brilliant touch screen remote dealio that controls everything i need with one remote: TV powers on/off automatically, sound bar on/off automatically, and volume control from the remote. If the Fire TV did those things, I'd be much happier with it."
"1452","I had to buy heatsinks to make it not freeze up.I think that is all I really need to say.Otherwise the interface is fine and the remote is cool, but it fails at its designed task which is playing media.Using DirectTV Now it froze up in ~10 minutes and started lagging in 5 minutes.I tried playing Youtube or Amazon video (dont remember which now) and ran into similar issues.Now with an 8 pack of heatsinks from Amazon all glued to it, it seems to work fine (even if it looks weird).Compared to my Roku Express this is much worse for what is $15 more."
"1453","I like this because I am cancelling my expensive cable and the kids mostly watch stuff on their kindle fires anyway. We also have amazon prime already so it was a benefit. Problem is, you better have a great modem or modem extenders in the rooms because it takes an extremely long time to get a show or movie to load up. And a lot of times it will say bad connection to retry, so I have to hit retry about 4 or 5 times before it will come on. It definitely will take some getting used to, but in the long run feel it will be much better than paying a whopping $300/mo for cable that you even have to pay for shows ondemand."
"1454","Love it.  we have other streaming devices such as Roku and Apple Tv, and this is by far the best streaming devices we own.  it is fast and easy to setup.  It came with everything we needed to set this up within minutes.  I would highly recommend the Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa."
"1455","This is probably one of the best items I have bought on amazon!The alexa voice could be better, but other than that I have had zero problems. It is definitly something to buy again and I have recommended it to nearly everyone I know.I love how easily I can download apps and programs onto the stick as well.The sleekness and ease that I am able to use this just astounds me literally!I would seriously get this item if you're looking to save money on tv bills and netflix/Hulu"
"1456","Good product. Amazing Amazon!!!You won't realize the important of this stick until you try it. Let's say Bye 🙋 bye 🙋 to cable. You only pay for the internet. $200 for a cable? I am dead done with cable. Now my new girl friend is Fire 🔥 TV. Thanks to Amazon."
"1457","This is my first Fire Stick, and really my first non-Apple streaming/media device.  We bought the Fire Stick to provide content to an outdoor TV without a cable connection and I really didn't want to spend $150 on another AppleTV.  So far I have been very impressed, the image is super clear, and the ability to download only the apps I want is really nice. For the most part all of the cable channels we watch on a regular basis we can stream directly to the device via their individual apps.  I do wish it played a little better with the Apple ecosystem but for the price, it does a great job."
"1458","We love it!  We are new to this technology as we have always been in a contract with cable TV of some sort. We decided to drop cable and try this!We are not Tech Savvy so we hesitated but finally got one!  Very simple to hook up, easy step by step instructions if we can do this ANYONE can!We enjoy, music, music videos, YouTube and Netflix!  There is so much more too!"
"1459","You guys. this is it. this is replacement for cable. I can subscribe to DirecTV Now for about $45/month and ditch my $140/month cable bill plus get more stations and more content. This sweet little device is so easy to use, install, set up, and manage I'm in love. I'm getting one for every TV in my house. Plus - I haven't yet - but I'm assuming you can travel with it and as long as you have internet access you've got your TV choices everywhere you go. BAM!"
"1460","You don't need internet stopped stream live TV. Simply activate your iPhone or android mobile hot spot and create ad hoc network. Than create user and password just like router Internet. Than type in user and password on the fire stick during intial setup. If your phone plan has unlimited data than good to go. Otherwise if you have internet just log in the Same way on fire stick. Detects both ad hoc and structure network."
"1461","We have two of these, probably will buy a third. This is the greatest little invention ever. Easy to use."
"1462","We are really enjoying our firestick. I've been able to figure it out just fine and it works well. I'm liking Alexa more than I thought I would. She is very easy to use. I even think we are going to buy another one very soon."
"1463","OHhhh Yeah..Fire Stick baby!! No cable for hommie here. I watch Amazon Prime and all of my favorite TV shows when I..want to watch them. Definitely a worthwhile investment for you who wised up like me and..cut the cable cord."
"1464","We love this - sorry we did not get one earlier.  You can use it to watch Amazon Video and Netflix, etc.The voice search feature is great.  Another feature I particularly like is that when you pause a video that you are streaming, you will see information at the bottom of the screen showing who the actors are in the SCENE where you paused.  Pretty slick!"
"1465","i love this! not only can i watch netflix, but my amazon prime movies, crackle and many more free sites to watch movies if one doesn't have what I'm in the mood for. easy to plug in and set up. just make sure you have your password for netflix and amazon otherwise its super easy. who needs to pay $$$$ for cable  lol"
"1466","This device is very user friendly and can be used on any TV that supports HDMI.  You can play, pause, and resume movies from any device that uses Amazon Prime. However, you must have a reliable high-speed internet connection."
"1467","the fire stick really is good product.  For the first time I have been able to watch movies I put on my watchlist.  It is also easy to use.  I bought this device because I was having trouble getting movies to work on my tv, and it has worked very well."
"1468","I really like my Fire TV stick! Really haven't used the Voice part of the remote but the rest of the controls are simple. I don't do well with voice commands on things like this. But overall I'm really happy with my purchase."
"1469","Was pretty frustrated that i could not get the remote to pair out of the box.  even tried new batteries.  So i got to examining the remote, and it has a major flaw.  The pictures embedded in the plastic tell you to put the batteries in BACKWARDS.  So i flipped them around against what it says, and boom it works right away.  This is the new version with the alexa remote.  I received it on 11-29-16"
"1470","I like the idea of this much more than I like the product itself mostly because I live outside the united states and I cannot use almost all of the features that are available for prime members. I have had success using Netflix and other video streaming apps so it isn't all bad but really I am disappointed that I can't use prime video streaming. Think about this carefully if you live outside the US."
"1471","Should have purchased a while ago.  I watch Amazon Video, Hulu and Netflix.  I was having issues watching the shows on my TV as I would constantly lose connection via my DVD player.  This resolved it.  Glad to be watching on my TV again."
"1472","I just began really using it. Jam not a person who watches TV. I have the blue ray when I want to watch a movie on Netflix OE Hulu. No! I am loving the Firestick. I am putting it in my room putting the blue ray in the spare and one of the gamersbcan stay in the family room. No tv in any other room but the den and my daughter. She will take her Firestick with her. I will leave a game in the den ans put a disc player in her room. I have this planned to the nines. Jam loving ty again . I am so excited thank you Amazon and Alexa! Should give one thing w3 dont already have as a free item haha"
"1473","Other than three issues, this Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote is perfect.Issue 1, and by far the most frustrating, was getting the case open to insert the batteries. The instructions are simply not clear and/or incorrect. I finally got a sharp knife and pried the cover back just a bit. Then it was easy to install the two supplied batteries.Issue two, Alexa did not understand my pronunciation of the John Wayne classic, Hatari. I worked that out in a couple minutes.Issue three concerns the clarity of the instructions for hooking up to the TV & HDMI. Perhaps Alexa app could include a stand alone audio that can be listened to before commencing? Maybe even a YouTube video that automatically plays on the user's smart phone or device?None of these three issues are extremely important, but they are significant enough to lower my rating to four stars.I am very pleased with Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote. Can't wait to see what Apple will counter with.Wonder how Direct TV & Dish will adjust?"
"1474","We've loved using the Fire Stick during the last year, and the upgrade is even better: speed, connection, browsing speed, app uploads, etc ... such a simple and useful way to cut the cable cord. We've been over the air and cable free for over a year with Amazon, Hulu and Netlix connection. Fantastic. My complaint about this is simply the remote. Not the functionality of the remote, but removing the back of the remote to install the batteries is very tricky and tight. Same on my first Fire Stick. I had to go to YouTube and find a video about this (and there is one) in order to get it open. Please fix this Amazon! Otherwise ... Well Done!"
"1475","I have been into video streaming for around 5 years, this little fire stick streams real well that I now leave the other brand streamer off. I don't know about the voice command side of this device, I don't think I would use that really.If your looking for a very reasonable stick video streamer with a good amount of video channel apps on it, then this would impress you.Bottom line- so far so great!"
"1476","Love the fire stick, couldn't get Amazon Prime to show up on the Chromecast so we had to buy this so we could have that access.  Easier to use than Chromecast since it has the remote. We ditched our DirecTV, stream Netflix and Prime through this, who both have their own original movies/series if you are worried about giving up prime time.  Also, plan on getting Sling TV during college basketball season to try and catch some of our teams."
"1477","I am sorry but I do not see where this is saving anyone the cost of their cable bill.  In order to watch some channels like Food Network or others, you still need your Direct TV or Uverse or whatever provider you had.  How is that saving you money?  I am a movie buff and love watching movies, so I will keep Amazon Prime but can someone explain to me please......How is the firestick, or any other stick, cost effective?  I am disappointed."
"1478","Does the trick for getting Netflix and other internet based tv onto all of our tv screens.  So easy to install that my impatient 12 yr old snagged it before I had the chance, and had her programs up and going without issues.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Good buy!"
"1479","I was extremely skeptical about this device. I have always thought these sorts of things were far too limiting. I generally keep a $1000+ PC hooked up to my TV's along with an equally significant sound system so I'm a bit of a tech-guy. I just put a TV over my bar and didn't want to deal with wall mounting a PC so I caved and bought one of these. It's amazing. It does everything you'd want it to do. I haven't had cable for years so I already have all of the subscriptions (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, HBO, etc.) I also find this a great thing to take on the road. Pop this into a hotel TV's hdmi slot and you can feel as though you're at home."
"1480","Possibly the best $39.99 I have ever spent.  Love the interface, very fast, and it follows voice commands perfectly.Great product.  Excellent choice of apps as well.  I like it a lot better than my $149.99 Apple TV.  But then we allknow that Apple products are WAY overpriced."
"1481","Let me just say I love this device. The only reason I am giving it a 4 is because I found the remote a little difficult to pair. the unit doesn't seem to see the remote and needed several attempts. After that it worked flawlessly. Love the interface and the voice control, but I would love to see more functionality in what you can query it with other than weather etc. The unit was losing connectivity with the router on a regular basis but I found that the reason was that the connection was broadcasting on the 2.4Ghz band, once I changed it to the 5.0Ghz range the connection was quite stable. I am looking to buy another one for the bedroom."
"1482","This is great when used with Amazon prime. Because Amazon prime has tons of shows and movies and also music that you can use this with. You can tell it to play music and it will play it off of prime. I use it mainly for direct tv now for streaming cable."
"1483","We love the system, but can't stand the remote.  It seems to not respond well and many times we are having to push the buttons repeatedly in order to get it to work.  Luckily, you can download a remote to your phone or tablet and it that to work the Fire system."
"1484","When I first got my fire stick I was super excited, it worked with NO problems in the first couple of days and before I even had it for a week it became very hard to work with. I don't know if it's just the remote control but I can't use it all. It has a delayed reaction, it can take up to an hour for me to get a program even started. Once it's streaming, no problem but choosing a program and navigating on the fire stick is the worst. I ended up downloading the ""fire tv remote"" on my phone and have no problems using my phone as a remote. I'm just worried when I have guests over."
"1485","Love it, works great.  bought 2 of these, one for the living room and one for the bedroom.  an amazon prime account is a must with this, pays for itself in all the free tv, music, and movies available with the prime account."
"1486","I love the fire stick itself. It is nice to have all my subscriptions are my finger tips, and it will be a great replacement for over priced cable. The only issue is that the remote is garbage. It constantly freezes, for lack of a a better term, and I have to remove the batteries and replace them to use it. Sometimes the connection lasts an hour, but other times it is every 3-5 minutes which is extremely frustrating. I looked online and it would appear this isn't an isolated incident. Hopefully they find a way to fix this issue and it becomes a 5 star for sure."
"1487","Love the Fire Stick..... no more paying cable for me!!!! It has tons of movies and tv shows to watch and I love the fact that I can connect it to any smart tv so when I go on vacations, this little item is coming with me!!!!"
"1488","Absolutely love it! I have an old TV that I had split the cable box with but box was in another room.  Now that I have the fire stick, I don't even bother with the cable box it is convenient and simple."
"1489","works well , I like the voice remote BUT the vast majority of the shows I want to watch I have to pay for, not exactly what I expected from the description  of the product. As a result I don't use it very much and I am a prime member."
"1490","I have the old fire tv stick but no alexa voice remote. The voice search seems to be very good. Searching for shows is so much easier than typing it. Definitely worth the upgrade. At first though, I tried to use the same power supply as the old Fire TV stick so I don't have to re-wire and I initially thought it worked. As I started using it though, it kept on rebooting. Searching the forums I found that this new fire tv stick requires more power so I just replaced the power supply with the one that it came with and its been stable since. I used the same USB cable from the old fire tv stick and it works just fine."
"1491","All I can say is I wish I cancelled my cable a looooong time ago! The amazon fire stick and remote is simply amazing and I will never use anything else! It's literally a plug and play concept with all the technical bells and whistles you could hope for! As for the Alexa remote...WOW! If you're looking for something thats easy AND awesome AND inexpensive, this dynamic duo is the way to go:)!"
"1492","Easy to install and easy to use!  I love the Alexa voice activation.  We now watch Netflix and Amazon Prime streaming videos by simply changing the input and saying what we want to watch.  I look forward to adding other apps."
"1493","Not sure why I haven't purchased this sooner. It is a heaven send. I love being able to binge watch things and watch ESPN App on my TV. Now LSU Tigers baseball looks so much batter on my 55 inch TV, which was also purchased from Amazon, than on my 10 Inch Tablet. Well worth the purchase."
"1494","The remote is so nice, even though we have a ""smart tv""  I prefer to use the Firestick- the platform and remote are so much more user friendly and the kids love that they can use Alexa to put on their favorite shows."
"1495","i'm new to this streaming business. I'm glad i chose the amazon fire stick , it is simple enough for me to navigate, with no prior knowledge of how it works. it works lovely i'll be getting another for my granddaughter's room"
"1496","The battery compartment is hard to open. The device failed after less than a month. A replacement is on the way but it took about an hour of our time trying to troubleshoot the issue then another half hour on the phone with support to get to the point where they agreed it was broken and will send a replacement. Should arrive tomorrow. Hopeful.."
"1497","This is very easy to use is not expensive the remote control is very easy is fast, if you dont have a smart TV this is a really good option is totally worth the price . Is not big you cant  even noticed this on the back of your tv ."
"1498","Really enjoying this fire stick. I actually gave it to my husband for his birthday & I am using it more than him. Ha, Ha. We are sitting and watching movies together. I highly recommend it. I haven't used Alexa voice remote as yet, but I will try speaking to her."
"1499","I bought this as an upgrade to my older fire stick and I am quite happy with the results.  The voice control took a bit to get used to, but now I don't want to lose it.  Couple this with Amazon Prime and you have a great watching experience."
"1500","Love my firestick. I downloaded Kodi to it. My intent is to disconnect my cable TV"
"1501","Best investment I have EVER made. I have never been much of a tech savy person but this thing is so simple and easy to use. I will admit it took a few hours to get the hang of it and set it up BUT I am now in head over heels in love. I will be forever grateful that I took the plunge and got it. I highly highly suggest getting this. BUT you must have an Amazon Prime acct. and wifi that works halfway decent. I was worried cuz my wifi is awful but it's working fine besides a few hiccups but I've had it a week and I pretty much understand how it works. So believe me when I say this is by faaaaar the best thing ever."
"1502","This is amazing!! I get all the movies and more!  Easy to program.  I also have the first firestick but other tv don't have a HDMI port.  I need converter but don't know if I need a male or female hdmi converter.  Please advise"
"1503","They say its an easy set up but its not. Cannot check weather, amazon music does  not respond, you cant use spotify because its not supported. Its just a very poorly set device set to compete with the market of growing smart tvs."
"1504","The hardware works as expected and is really OK. The issue here is that the cost is too high for something I can do already with my laptop. It is too much money for a tiny bit more convenience, For this kind of expense, I would like to see more features that I suspect might show up over time,"
"1505","It works OK, but does not show the video synopsis before viewing without extra clicks.It also locks up periodically and needs to be rebooted.I only bought it because my other player did not include Amazon video."
"1506","Sometimes it takes a minute to upload but its still much better then cable. My bill isn't changing monthly. I've got TV, movies (old and new), box office etc.Its great!One great price $39.99 don't let anyone over charge you, just goggle what you need to know."
"1507","This has been awesome. But you def need prime and suggest getting kodi for this. But i haven't stopped watching movies on this and will be lowering my cable to just internet and basic. This will save me hundreds on my bill."
"1508","Tried to use it with ATT internet TV $45 / month additional and still no regular TV Channels (can't find them) only all the archived programs and movies. Is all of that Amazon? Very confusing. Can I use this with other internet based TV services. You don't explain anything about what I can connect to? or how to connect. No service from ATT just on your own.Something about ""Imput"" on the original channel selector which I can not find.I'm sure i won't hear for Amazon eitherI'm really trying to get rid of TW/Spectrum >>> That's evil"
"1509","Just like all other Amazon products, this Fire TV Stick is a bargain for $40 and operating speeds are quick enough, I added it to an older LCD TV and now have access to Amazon Videos, Netflix, Plex, etc, it's like a brand new TV!"
"1510","Remote control confusing.  It seems you have to hit the 'back' icon repeatedly until you're where you want to be.  Its 'home' icon takes you to a screen you can't get out of.  Basically works as long as you have impressive Wi-Fi."
"1511","I previously used Roku and still own one Roku. Honestly, I like this much better. I especially like the voice prompter for mornings that I am barely awake to watch the news or weather. It seems to be much more user friendly so far."
"1512","Love the Fire Stick. It is so much easier to access apps such as Netflix and Amazon prime content than with my Sony Blu Ray player. Watch ESPN is also a great app."
"1513","MUCH better than the previous generation of Fire Stick (without Alexa)- very little buffering and no image stutter so far. I'm quite pleased as HBO go always had problems with the previous model.Alexa is not as cool as the hype. She frequently tells me she can't do things (like rewinding 20 seconds) that she is advertised as being capable of. But once you figure out some of the things it can do, it's fun to mess around with. We are in no danger of a Skynet takeover at this point."
"1514","Works really well however I do encounter problems with sound and many apps crashing while using the fire stick.I used this to replace my Apple TV 4th generation and don't see much of a difference except that the firestick is much cheaper and I like how I don't have to leave it out on display like the Apple TV."
"1515","I cut the cable cord and this helped me do it. Good movies and I really like it. The only thing it lacks is major news coverage like CNN or MSNBC or FOX. If I could see the news with the Amazon Fire Stick it would be great."
"1516","Like other things people say; it's awesome however my issue is quite simple, It's wonderful when it works. After a few weeks now it randomly drops internet connection and won't reconnect until i power cycle it; the customer support was lackluster and treated me as if i had no clue what i was doing after i informed them i was well versed in electronics. It's truly a shame.... I was so pleased with it at first, easily one of the best products i had ever purchased (packaging, workmanship) just to be let down by customer service, i get some products are bad eggs or have issues but don't treat us like we are neanderthals!!!"
"1517","I have 4 of these and all 4 run flawlessly. I'm not sure why or how these people are disappointed. I've streamed from every device under the sun and this is the simplest way to go. Get a decent speed WiFi and a decent TV and there should be zero problems. This does exactly what it's advertised for so what are people expecting, some sort of hidden bonus feature...c'mon people, it's only 40 bucks!!!"
"1518","Overall, did what I expected it to.  One big drawback, is the apps available for this isn't as robust as I was hoping.  For instance Vudu and Fandango now are not available.  But for prime and netflix, it serves it purpose."
"1519","We are satisfied with the Amazon Fire TV Stick.. Streaming is smooth without lag or jitter.. The Alexa interface works well and has good voice recognition.. One thing we do not like is having to re-enable screen mirroring each time we want to use it.. Roku allows you to activate screen mirroring and leave it on.. Adding that option would make using the Fire TV Stick more convenient.. Easy five stars if that is changed and the menu navigation gets refined so it is easier to find shows you like. (however the menu is pretty good overall)"
"1520","I watched Amazon Prime Movies on a new smart TV.  Then I purchased a Fire Stick for an older smart tv.  The Fire Stick was many times faster, easier to use, and just gave so many options to find, select, and watch movies.  It is a wonderful tool. Only regret is that I didn't purchase sooner!"
"1521","Bought this for my husband so he can watch the new Star Trek on CBS. OMG, it is awesome!  Except for the hard to open remote, the ease of use is great, and discovering new stations by the minute. Cable is about to be replaced!"
"1522","I've had this for at least 8 months at this point and have had no issues. The firestick exceeded my expectations. It's so easy to set up and is so convenient. I love it and will definitely buy it again if this one ever quits."
"1523","The reason I don't give it a five is because of the lack of languages option. I bought this as a present for my mom who speaks Spanish, and this stick doesn't have Spanish. It has just six languages English US, English UK, English India, two kind of Dutch, and Chinese. There is not an option to download other languages, which is why I called Customer service. The girl that I talk to was really nice and really tried to help me but there was not anything she could do to help me. So now I have a Fire Stick in English that my mom doesn't know how to use, and I have help her every time she wants to watch something."
"1524","This was sooo easy to setup and use.  I love Amazon Box of which I have two but now this is my first Fire Stick.  I have not noticed any lag or buffering problems (Tested for several days of heavy use on the same TV that the Amazon Box is on).  I have been able to download my Sling app with no problems.  Purchased the ""all New"" fire stick just FYI.  Only difference I see is that the menu looks different between this Fire Stick and the Amazon TV Box.  The overall drop down and selections are still there but the placement and the icons slightly different in location and size.  It is not a problem though."
"1525","I purchased this about a month ago because I got tired of paying too much for cable.The remote is small and user friendly and so is the interface.  For Netflix and some of the other apps, this device is ok.  But if you want to stream live TV or watch shows on demand with an app such as SlingTV, this isn't a good option.  It frequently freezes no matter what station I'm on and it takes several seconds to load.  At first I thought it was the app, but I don't have these types of problems when I use my iPad. I also have the fastest internet speed that Time Warner offers so this shouldn't be an issue.  Overall, I'm disappointed."
"1526","Easy install. Works well. Has the apps I need - Netflix and Amazon. Trying Hulu now. Took awhile to figure out out to move around the site. Amazon is built in and doesn't have an app. No need for a smart TV with the Stick."
"1527","I love my fire stick! This is the 3rd one I have purchased. I may purchase one more so that I won't have to move it from TV to TV. I dont know why I didnt purchase one before now. It was delivered before the time expected."
"1528","Great product, very fast.  Only thing I missed is that the picture doesn't show you that there is a power cord that goes from the Stick to an outlet.  When your TV is on the wall you have a cord that hopefully reaches the outlet."
"1529","I wouldn't get this if Charter is your cable provider.  Too many apps don't work with Charter on the FireStick."
"1530","This product does not work outside of the U.S unless, you have a U.S IP address. The only app you would be able to use is Netflix. Other than that, the speed is great, the voice key is a nice feature and it was shipped on time."
"1531","I love my firestick. I always used my old PlayStation to watch Netflix and would use my i pad to watch movies on prime. This little stick can do it all, and can be taken with you wherever you go; for example hotels when you go out of town."
"1532","This thing has saved me so much money, that it could have cost a few hundred and it still would have paid for itself. I don't want to go into all the details, but lets just say a friend of mine, who's name is youtube, showed me how to download certain software that allowed me to access some great content. I was going CRAZY for 2 months straight trying to find a favorite show of mine called Gomorah and because it's an Italian show, it was impossible to find here. But with the help of my friend Youtube, I was able to download Kodi and the heavens opened up. One of the best purchases I ever made and it's saved me a ton of money.Now, I will say that Kodi is the only software Ive used on it so far. I have not used it regularly, so I cant go into whether or not it works on that end. I will say, that I also have a Apple TV and the quality of the remote is NOWHERE near the quality of the Apple remote. Not even close. The Fire Stick remote and real cheap, but what do you expect for that price point?"
"1533","Once you get everything set up, it is overall, a good experience. However, it is a royal pain to open the remote control to put the batteries in. Frustrating that something so simple that so many manufacturers have gotten right so many times before is so elusive to such a big company like Amazon.  Terrible product design. I had to pry mine open with a small tool and it left marks on the remote control."
"1534","Replaced a generation one fire stick and it is much faster. Unfortunately, first remote was defective as it kept eating batteries. Replacement has worked just fine."
"1535","I had this thing for several months now and it's ""okay"".  It's more frustrating than anything else because a lot of the shows we like to watch have ""no stream"" or when the show does play, it is intermittent and streaming is terrible.  By the time we finally find something that streams worth a damn, it's time to turn the tv off and go to bed. I can stream things on my computer with no problem, but this thing pauses when it feels like it, streaming sucks, and finding a tv show or movie that plays like it should takes forever.  If I had to do it over again, I probably wouldn't buy the fire stick."
"1536","The voice remote is a nice upgrade to the original fire stick.  I am often stuck finding a video or movie that I am interested in.  Last week I simply could not find a 1970's era movie about swedish immigrants to the US via conventional word search.  However when I voiced the words ""Find the immigrants"" it immediately found ""The Emigrants"", the movie that I was searching for.  The better Wi-Fi with dual frequencies and newer AC standard is also quite nice.  I am now able to stream HD movies downstairs with no significant reduction in bandwidth, at least compared to the older fire stick system."
"1537","Just plugged in, and trying to use Beachbody on Demand, which is the only reason I bought this, and it goes to a black screen. Just read other reviews with this app and they all say the same thing. And I don't know where to go for help to make it work. Very disappointed!Edited later in the day...so I was finally able to get BOD app to work (may have been an issue with the app not the Fire stick), I think this'll work great. And we realized we can probably return our Verizon Fios box for this tv now that we have access to Netflix and Amazon Prime. Think this was a great purchase, sorry for my rant earlier..."
"1538","My father wanted something on which he could watch Netflix and other streaming services. I had a PS3 that I wasn't using and he had difficulty using it, so I bought him this. It works great and is easy to use. Now the only problem is keeping up with the remote."
"1539","I LOVE this thing! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes it can be a bit glitchy (can take a while to find a video that is streaming smoothly) and some of the shows I wanted to see are not available for streaming at all. Other than that, I'm having a blast with it! The biggest downside?--I'm watching WAY too much tv now."
"1540","I really wanted to love this.....I have wanted the Amazon Fire Stick for a while. We have a Roku but I love Amazon products. I was disappointed with this one. I really like the Roku layout better. I don't want all the extra stuff on my home screen. There was just too much going on for me. It felt cluttered and busy.  It is probably a personal preference thing but this just wasn't for me."
"1541","It took a while to get it to connect to my wifi network, but once connected, it is easy to use. I wish the voice command would take you directly to the season and episode you wish to watch because it always starts at the latest season and you have to go back to find the episode you were on. It should automatically take you to the next episode after the one you previously watched. Please teach it to be more intuitive than it is. Overall, I enjoy the product. It just needs a little tweaking."
"1542","but only because of the K word. you must know to hack this for the same star rating.Out of the box it a 2 star device.if you don't know the K word, buy a Roku, that is the best consumer video box without any hacks."
"1543","My firestick without Alexa works perfectly. I've changed batteries. I stood next to the firestick. It absolutely refuses to pair after getting stuck and needing to be reset. It was outside of the 30 days so I have a non functioning firestick. If they still have the one without Alexa get itUpdatedWent through troubleshooting and after how many attempts it works. I swear sometimes customer service has to be in the phone. Held the home button for ten seconds. Changed batteries. Removed from HDMI port. Which I had done before. Did again with Mike and it worked. Though it cycled three times. It's working so far"
"1544","Love this newer version of fire stick. Works pretty snappy and I like the Voice Control too. Interface on it is organized and easy to figure out. Love the fact that when my family goes on vacation we can take the firestick with us and use wherever we stay.!"
"1545","This latest version of the Fire TV Stick is definitely faster than the first version that we had bought but not as fast as the Fire TV. We're very happy with its performance as it's very easy to setup and use immediately."
"1546","Bought a cheap 40"" led TV and hooked this up and my kids are enjoying the all the shows they wanted to watch. It also has the ability to download some apps and the microphone feature is a big plus! Highly recommended!"
"1547","Perfect!!!! I can watch my VUDU movies on my fire stick!!! The app movies anywhere connects to Disney movies, VUDU, iTunes and amazon video!!!! Finally this is perfect!!! Goodbye cable this is a fire stick only family!!! (Updated 10-13-17)"
"1548","Very good product! Streams from Netflix, Hulu, and my Plex server flawlessly! I also have Kodi installed but for totally legal streaming!"
"1549","Love Love LOVE this!!! my smart tv (sharp) stopped allowing me to use hulu so I got this and it works great. Love the speak option.  I can't find a vudu app on it yet but I'm still looking. Love that I can operate it from my phone."
"1550","Found installation to be easy. The Fire Stick menu system is intuitive and simple yet thorough. The remote was very easy to use however, for one-handed use, the circular navigation control could be a bit closer to the other buttons."
"1551","I've got the attached to 1 tv and an Apple TV 4th Generation serves my other tv. The Apple wins hands-down for my more frequent uses, but it's also 3-4 times the price. For the money, this is just fine and I'll keep using it."
"1552","All in all, a great device.  It can be a little quirky- a couple of times it's ""frozen"" and had to be restarted- but my wife and I like it.  Our 13 year-old prefers the Roku, because it's ""easier.""Setting it up was less intuitive than the Roku, and getting used to the interface took some time (which it didntnon the Roku).  So one start off for being somewhat less intuitive."
"1553","Works as good as your internet service is, if you have a slow connection you better have a lot of patience. Also, I don't recommend using multiple devices using the same internet connection if you have a slower connection. You'll want to smash the remote and firestick because its impossible to use multiple devices at the same time."
"1554","Freezes up at least 2 or 3 times a night.  Right in the middle of a show.  very frustrating. Update.  Why does this keep shutting off.  I have fast internet.  Aaarrghhhhh.  I thought This would be a better alternative to cable !!!!!"
"1555","The Fire TV stick is the best.  I have the Google chromecast but I like having the remote better instead of getting my phone or ipad to control.  Everything works great.  Especially if you have Amazon Prime.  Never a dull moment."
"1556","One of my best amazon purchases ever.  Has a great selection of apps that allows you to watch most tv shows and movies, as well as live tv with apps like sling player"
"1557","Did you know you can plug your Fire TV stick into the game port on you're Home Theater Audio Box. This keeps the stick cooler since it's not close to the hot TV and you can now use your surround sound system.  Make sure you set the sound for the game port.  This may extend the life of your Stick."
"1558","There is a reason it is on back order.  Great item, I just ordered a carrying case and a 2 pkg of 3 foot hdmi extetension cables (one for my TV, so I don't have to move the TV every time I travel with the stick, and one to pack) I installed kodi on mine right away using a u tube video and was watching a movie 30 minutes later.  Don't hesitate, buy one and you will save money by cutting the cable and Netflix like I did."
"1559","This is a fantastic tool for watching streamed video from multiple apps. I found switching from app to app on my television a bit tedious. With the Fire TV Stick I am able to easily navigate from program to program with my voice. No more accessing the main menu and scrolling down to find the correct app for a specific show. It took a little while to set up but the ease of navigation makes the time (and $$) investment worth my while."
"1560","One of the best products AMAZON has ever put out. I use this daily and with the right apps, the possibilities are endless with this thing. Every Holiday I buy these for relatives who do not have one. And the best part is they always drop them to $30 on special sales. GOOD JOB AMAZON!"
"1561","This was a much snappier experience than the original, and the remote feels better. That said I found Alexa frustrating to deal with then never touched the button again. Also not a fan of the browsing mechanisms. It’s hard to find anything, and recommendations suck. When I compare it to the amazon video app on my roku, I just get frustrated because I know it can be simpler and smoother."
"1562","This is a great concept but it's a little hard to navigate. It was given to us as a Christmas gift and our son had to show us (for hours) how to work it. It has Netflix, Amazon Prime shows, YouTube, and you can get current movies that are in theaters and lots more—more than with our Roku which we had before. A downside is that some of the network tv shows are very grainy when you enlarge them to fit a larger tv screen. Another downer—trying to get a Nickelodeon cartoon to play for our grandkids was like pulling teeth. Plus, I don't know if it will work if we should ever cancel our Amazon Prime subscription."
"1563","I love having my fire stick. It does everything it is suppose to perfectly except for when using it for extended amounts of time. It tends to start freezing up and having to buffer videos forever after using it for a while. The only thing that I can attribute that to is that it may be overheating? When I touch it, it is usually pretty warm so I will unplug it and then let it cool and then try again and its good as new. I don't know if that is the source of the problem but have seen other people complain about the same thing. I would like to see Amazon release a newer version that does not have this problem."
"1564","Great product .voice remote actually works,i'll say ""launch netflix"" and it opens netflix. The menu also operates smoother than the previous generation of fire stick which I also own. It turns your regular TV into a smart tv in full HD it looks and sounds good, the menu options during streaming are also better than when I use a tablet the software is organized nicely it replaced all my tablets for streaming. Only thing that is annoying is that it needs more power than my tv provides to work to I have to plug it in to a wall outlet hopefully the next generation doesn't need to be plugged into a wall."
"1565","A birthday gift for my bedroom  This is so much better than the original one.  Really like the Alexa Voice remote. Put all the pieces where they were supposed to go turned the tv on, picked my HDMI and away it went.  Worked like a charm!"
"1566","I love my 5 fire sticks. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because amazon needs to work with app developers or themselves on regulating commercial volume. Cialis / dodge / tide and quite a few others a 2 to 3 times louder that the volume of the show you are watching. Sometime you have to keep your finger on the mute button.  That the one thing I hate and everyone in the house hates. Please amazon fix this issue."
"1567","Because I bought this via Amazon, it came pre-configured to use my Amazon Prime account.  Plugged it in, hooked it up to my wireless network and was using the device in 5 minutes!  And you can link your blue tooth wireless keyboard to it, to make entering data easier.  I like the fact that you can customize your screens so your favorite apps show up at the beginning of the list.  A definite must for 'cable cutters'."
"1568","It's a fire stick, what else is there to say.  Like that it's preloaded with my account stuff on it.  Great for my RV, because I don't want to rely on resorts or campgrounds for their cable.  I have a sat dish for my RV, but no longer pay the extra fee for a box we hardly use.  Definitely worth the money if you have Amazon Prime and other services like HBO.go and the like."
"1569","4 star except for getting the batteries in.  that was impossible.  and took over an hour.  had to look up multiple you tubes.  nothing worked.  until someone said you have to bang it open and finally that worked.  crazy!"
"1570","I love this. It is super easy to use. I don't use it for many things, but Netflix and amazon music work well. I am sure there are tons of other things to do with it, I just don't. The screen saver pictures are beautiful."
"1571","Purchased in January 2017.  Worked great, occasionally would freeze but overall great.  Then just the other day I turned it on and it said 'no support'.  Tried different TV and it turned on to Amazon logo, then green pixels then 'no support'.  The HDMI had become damaged somehow I am assuming due to strange design of how everything connects to TV.  I contacted Amazon and will get a replacement in the mail today since it comes with a 1 Year Warranty."
"1572","My wife and my two teen kids love it watch enjoy  TV show and movie and also never seen before and I like see message  three or four and five stars we like watching. Also we did borrow from library DVD and but sometimes no time watching DVD three days take it back . Fire TV Stick that was awesome  they have more ever and but to see rent or buy it DVD  . Dont have to getting and wait until come up for free dont have to  pay and open go in Fire TV Stick three different prices....... I pay $11,99 first time it free until next month then pay $11.99  Not bad pricing ! Real pretty cool"
"1573","Top notch all the way around.  We used to have an Apple TV and ditched it for the Fire Stick.  All of the apps are easy to load, and Videos available to Prime users are easily accessible.  We had a Roku stick as well and have ditched that.Setup is a breeze.  I was successful in getting my parents to cut the chord by getting them their own fire stick, I sprung for the voice remote for theirs.If you are trying to decide between the three, do yourself a favor, and use this.  Even a Chromecast does not compare.  Forget the Apple TV pick this up and save a few bucks, you won't regret it."
"1574","My family and I love it especially since we can voice operate it with Alexa..........to think I use to be the remote when I was a kid but now the Fire Stick is the remote, but now I gotta find another way to get some exercise! :-)"
"1575","The wife and I bought one of these after falling in love with the Amazon Echo.Slick and effective, and works with our Echo too! No lag or stutter at all, and as a result has replaced most of our TV's built-in apps."
"1576","I bought the Fire TV Stick as an alternative to cable. It was definitely one of the best choices I have ever made. I can log onto my family Netflix, HBO and Cable provider accounts for certain channels and watch all the shows I want to. I love all the apps that can be downloaded as well like Youtube, GoPro, and Pandora. I would recommend this to anyone looking to save a little money on TV, or any student whose family has a TV service provider at home that provides channels that you can get as apps on the Fire Stick. Great product!"
"1577","Works perfectly! Very easy to use. Will be purchasing more for my other TV's! Alexa is very limited not sure if I like that addition. The remote is a nicer size and the option to use a smartphone for remote is very nice."
"1578","I truly adore my Firestick. I can't see myself without having one in every room. My husband and I took our Firestick to our timeshare for a week. It was the perfect entertainment when we were just relaxing around the cabin."
"1579","This new version of the Amazon Firestick is worth the upgrade, even the unboxing was a great experience with the new packaging. The device comes with a voice remote which works flawlessly at just the push of a button. I had the previous Firestick and this new one is way faster, and runs smoother, say goodbye to buffering and the home screen loads way faster than before. I recommend this device if you are looking for a smooth and quick streaming device. There are also fun family friendly games that you can download from the appstore which i enjoyed with my siblings. Like i said before, this is worth the purchase!"
"1580","Mt husband and I were tired of the high cost of cable. We decided to try the Fire TV stick with  Alexamples voice. We have only had it a short time and we are still learning everything about it but so far we absolutely love it!"
"1581","It's as it is described.  The Alexa voice control is nothing to write home about.  A novelty for this device; barley use it as it doesn't work well.  The other Amazon voice devices work way better, the Echo is works great."
"1582","I was a bit reluctant at first purchasing another Stick vs a ""Box"" because the 1st generation stick gave me nothing but problems slowing way down running the applications.  I've exchanged the older version once and received a replacement 1st generation that was worse the the original.After purchasing this ""All-New"", 2nd generation stick I can say, at least at this point in time, That I am satisfied with it.Later reviews to come should this one turn out like the 1st.All-New Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player"
"1583","I had enjoyed the speed of this new Fire TV stick processor with no wait to change to new apps.  I also have the older version and found it good, but now this new version is great. I also am really pleased it supports wireless 802.11ac which my router broadcasts in addition to the 802.11 N. I no longer have any buffering problems that occasionally occurred with the older version.in my upstairs rooms. The voice search is wonderful. I recently purchased the newest version of Amazon Fire TV box, and really like that too, however I find that the Fire TV stick is just as fast in watching video, and the Fire TV stick is a lot cheaper. ."
"1584","Upgraded from regular Amazon Fire TV Stick. The ""open Netflix"" feature and ""play Johnny Cash"" feature alone made it worth the price. Anything that you search for through Amazon (up, down, left, right arrow keyboard) is now a spoken command. Had it just over a week and still learning what Alexa can do. Good thing she can't make beer runs, or I would never get any exercise."
"1585","Already had one Fire for one tv (for 2 years), bought a Fire tv stick for my second tv.  Very happy with both.  With the Amazon Fires and an indoor tv antenna for local stations, no need for cable or satellite which saves me money."
"1586","I have struggled with other devices (Apple's) and this was basically plug and play! Have enjoyed several movies and the Amazon series - The Man in the High Castle. I would recommend this to everyone thats a Prime member!"
"1587","I purchased this hoping to access more local channels that were not coming in clear through my antenna. I was greatly disappointed that the only stations I can access are those that are available either through Amazon Prime or through a cable subscription. If the purpose of this stick is to get rid of cable, why do I need a subscription? And if I have cable, why do I need the Fire Stick? The promise of access to all these channels is false, unless you already have cable. There are a few interesting apps that I have not tried yet, so hopefully it expands my options. If they turn out well, I will update my review"
"1588","It took us a little while to figure out the difference between the fire stick and just using the blue ray dvd player for access.  As we become more comfortable with the way it works and the features (still discovering some) the better we like it.  Takes a little getting used to using the fire stick vs the cable set top box.  We like the ability to pick the type of programming we like as apposed to bundles that contain lots of stuff we never access."
"1589","I and everyone that visits to me are in love with this... I had Appl TV, Roku's, WD TV and even Android TV boxes, and this one is plain simple and works extremely fast, I had no problems, just some minor internet connection but was the modem... This will be the best cheap Media Player Streamer that you could get for the price... Just get a No-Smart TV (without all the Smart TV common security issues). Get a Netflix account and download Youtube too!"
"1590","Easy to attach to TV and has opened up so many shows, movies, etc. available through Amazon Prime to watch on my TV set.  Also like being able to tell Alexa what I want to watch!  Great addition to my viewing pleasure for a very reasonable price."
"1591","I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested in cutting their cable bill.  When it first arrived, I tried setting it up with my Element tv which unfortunately did not work.  However, the situation was quickly resolved once I switched to the Visio.  The actually setup was very simple and quick.  I have been using the Firestick since November and I have not missed cable once.  In daily life, it is so simple to use and the app selection is huge.  I have noticed that we replace the batteries often on the remote however."
"1592","I love my firestick. There are so many apps that you can download to stream tv shows and movies. I had to get this when my smart tv wouldn’t play the STARZ app and I haven’t used my smart tv hub ever since getting this."
"1593","I have only had this for a week, but it's been fun to have. It's easy to use and since I have Prime, it's perfect for watching movies and shows. I have not used many of the other apps, but I'm sure I will at some point."
"1594","The Amazon Firestick is great.  Would have given it a 5 star but some of the channels you go on the picture is not clear.  I think in time and different updates down the road it will just get better. Very happy with it."
"1595","Wow! I love this gadget! I have an Apple TV as well, which I love also, but the Fire Stick was super easy & to install, the aps were just a snap, Alexa is way more intuitive than Siri. Alexa is so great in fact I'm ordering the full tower and the dots for my entire house. The streaming range is fantastic, we have had range issues in our house even with a new router but the Fire stick has had no such issues. I am enjoying the full range of prime shows,  Hulu, Netflix as well as the numerous other streaming aps. The downside is I'm never going to get any housework done if I don't get off the couch!!!! I give this a 2 thumbs up!!!!!"
"1596","Real easy to use with the voice control. We just started with sling TV, and it works seamlessly. My wife says the only reason she hasn't divorced me yet is that she wouldn't be able to watch TV if I wasn't around to help her navigate through all our stuff. Now that we have a couple of these, I'm getting a little worried. Also works great with our Hulu and Netflix. I have found out the hard way that many so called 'smart' TVs aren't very smart at all and you cannot add any apps. My one year old Samsung that I paid a grand for wouldn't let me add sling TV. Wasn't a happy camper but this baby saved the day."
"1597","Just got it and it does the one thing I needed perfectly. I live in Mexico and needed it for TV watching. I'll learn more about its uses later. But it brings me CNN and the remote is easy to manage. Plus the price was great."
"1598","The fire stick was easy to install.  I rated  it a four out of five b/c the whole tv experience is so much more difficult than to just turn on Direct TV. However, I do like the monthly savings. I just need to get used to watching TV this way.  I haven't tried Alexa voice control yet but my grandsons did and it seemed easy and effective."
"1599","Works as advertised and plays nice with an antenna. My son likes the Alexa. The only issue is surprisingly hot to the touch after a short while of use. Just wondering how long it will last. Not sure if I would buy another."
"1600","The Fire TV Stick is exactly as I expected it to be. On occasion though, the remote stops working. I don't know why and I haven't figured out how to fix it. I like the voice remote. That comes in handy when I am looking for something specific."
"1601","Great option for areas where I don't have cable run. Also, I have been renovating my house and I move a small TV with this to which ever room I am working in. My 3 year old has started using it for netflix. I just hand him the remote and he navigates through it."
"1602","Voice function didn't work well for me, but I only tried it for a few mins as I was setting this up for mother-in-law. Works great for streaming Netflix/Amazon and replaced an old clunky PS3 we had been using for similar functionality."
"1603","It's good but needs more movies available for free on Amazon prime I pay 10 a month and still have to pay for most of the things the kids or myself want to watch"
"1604","I haven't received this 2nd order as yet, but this has to be one of the best purchases for the money you can make. It works flawlessly, both manually and with your voice and you can use add-ons, which makes this the total package for viewing literally anything out there."
"1605","Prise wise it's on point but I feel for the amount of money I spent on it or should get a better remote one that I can use to play , stop pause the movies actual buttons not just having to look for the menue on the movie......just update the remote over all good product."
"1606","This freezes on me every time I use it.  I have to unplug it and reconnect it constantly.  If I could make it through one movie without it crashing would be a miracle.  It's a shame because I really like it other than that."
"1607","Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media PlayerI am very satisfied with my Fire stick with Alexa Remote.  It is working very well with streaming movies, and I am learning that Alexa can be very helpful and fun."
"1608","I really would recomend this over the apple  tv and all others i had a apple tv which was way more expensive and this worked the same way  or better.  The os on the amazon fire is flawless And easy to understand  do yourself a favor and dont spend your money on anything else."
"1609","The Fire TV Stick is just great; better, in fact, than the Roku 3 that I also have two of.  Being able to side-load other apps such as Kodi is a benefie that you don't have with Roku.  I do have a problem with the Fire Stick though; it doesn't work with my 65"" Sony Amazon TV on a regular basis for some reason!  I've tried it in each of the four HDMIs, and it just won't work at all most of the time.  Both of the Fire Sticks do work every time on my 55"" Vizio and the 32"" Vizio in my office.  So, the stick itself is fantastic but dependability, at least as far as my Amazon Sony TV is a problem."
"1610","The stick was easy to install and is easy to use. If I turn the T.V. off in the middle of a show that I am watching on the stick, it will be at the exact spot when I turn it back on. The Alexa voice control works great."
"1611","I recently dumped Direct-Tv due to price and nothing to watch. I took a chance on the Fire Stick. It's one of the best purchases I've ever made. With so many choices and programming that I myself actually enjoy(without commercials!) This is a no brainer."
"1612","This fire stick was a little difficult to install on our tv. Had to have my daughter look at youtube videos for help. Took the better part of the day to get it to work. For the most part it does what it says but does take time to load shows and channels."
"1613","This is great.  It gets me to my favorite tv shows and movies very quickly.  Thanks to my son, who set it up for me.  It didn't seem too difficult, but I have to give him the credit.  Enjoying it in a room that doesn't receive the cable signal that well."
"1614","I had a Roku, but it zonked out on me after 5 years.  I love the voice activated remote.  My TV was a little older, so I couldn't use the USB cable for power (there wasn't one on the set).  Other than that, it's great."
"1615","Even better than expected. This amazing piece oh tech allows me to watch AMAZON's video library on my TV, WOW. Easy access to my other APP's too who could want more. Very pleased and happy with it. 10 stars if I could."
"1616","I purchased this because I was getting tired of not being able to watch prime videos through my apple tv (older version) and I didn't want to pay another $135 for a new version of an apple tv.  I am SO happy I purchased this, I went out and bought a second one at Best Buy over the weekend.  I love that I can have sling tv, all of my prime movies and TV shows as well as my premium subscriptions on one device.  It performs better than my apple tv too.  I don't have any buffering or lag that I sometimes get with my apple TV and you can't beat the price of $39.99!I might be getting a few more to give to friends for christmas."
"1617","We are in our 50 s and still learning all the new tech devices but I highly recommend this addition to your home's system.  With our smart TV we were able to set it up easily.  Amazon customer service is so helpful too"
"1618","The bluray player we were using to stream Netflix and Amazon was having buffering issues and we didn't want to buy a new player just for streaming.  This Firestick has been great and it's such a reasonable price. We love the Alexa voice remote feature too.  We use it to stream Netflix and Amazon prime as well as Amazon music."
"1619","I've only been using it for a week and I have still left my ROKU attached so I could do a side by side comparison. The screens are very different and the layout seems confusing...maybe its better but I don't know at this time."
"1620","what can I say about the fire stick just plug it in and, presto you are up and running, from their just do you thing, Get your apps and bingo things work great 100% satisfied with my fire stick TV!!!Thanks Amazon"
"1621","Awsome! much better than the 1st generation. Better connectivity over wifi, and Alexa allows for a quicker search. The specifications are almost identical to the Fire TV box. Another great addition to cable TV cutting."
"1622","Get rid of cable and get Netflix and Hulu and a firestick and only pay 50 bucks a month instead of $200 with cable or DirecTV Etc and you get way more shows that you would rather watch anyways. The fire stick is the only way to go in my book."
"1623","I only ever used Roku but after 2 failed units I figured I'd give Fire TV a shot. Works great so far and I like the differences for the most part. Alexa is actually pretty useful with great voice recognition. The reason I can't give it 5 stars is that it requires a Prime account to use a lot of the functionality and it is missing Crunchyroll, Google Play, Spotify, and Vudu that are on Roku."
"1624","The hardware itself is great. It runs fast and is easy to use. The problem with it is the apps are terrible. What streaming device in this day and age doesn't have Vudu?!?!? Seriously?!?! I never even thought to check because everything else in the world has it. Hell, even my smart tv has it, but not Amazon. The main reason I bought the thing for and it doesn't even do it. It's also missing VRV which is a little more understandable. I bought this to replace a Roku Express, which had every app I could imagine, but it ran slow as hell. I'm very disappointed in Amazon right now."
"1625","It's not what i expected have to unplug and reprogram TV to watch normal xfinity chanels. Most of the commands to Alexa are greated with couldn't  find or ask to repeat. Alexa is virtually useless. What a waste of good money."
"1626","I had already bought 2 of the Fire TV's and paid more. But they made this latest version of the Fire Stick so good, I wish all my T.V.'s were on them.. They are AWESOME!! I've had it for about a month now, No problems."
"1627","This is awesome. Works exactly like it is supposed to. My only complaint is with our local internet / DSL service which soaks us for GB. We had to scale down HD to SD wherever possible to make our generous GB package last the whole month. At full HD capacity on the Fire Stick & Kindle we were using 10 GB daily, and have now scaled it down to 3-5 GB per day.  It is disappointing when our internet service is not quite on par with technology available. They offer the high speed, but it is very expensive.  However, there is nothing to complain about with the sticks performance. We are mesmerized like gaping monkeys."
"1628","Good for the price but very slow compared to Apple TV 4.  My download speed is 75 and found the interface loading was slow and app content loading was very slow in some cases. My Apple TV on same wifi the content loads soooo much faster  The Alexa voice search is leaps and bounds ahead of Siri though. Alexa got all of my questions no matter how difficult the statement, Siri hardly ever gets things right. I would assume that the 4K fire tv would be faster compared to the stick if speed is of concern I would get the Apple TV or the 4K fire tv."
"1629","Fire TV has been great for many years and this upgrade is no different."
"1630","Works wonderfully! We use it for PlayStation Vue, Netflix, prime and Hulu!Vue works better on the stick than the PS4."
"1631","Alexa is great at voice recognition. I forget to use it sometimes because I am not used to a remote having voice control. But, I'm not even used to my phone having the same. I'm just behind on technology, I suppose. But, perhaps that is what makes me that much more grateful."
"1632","Love it. We cancelled our satellite TV provider. Many more advantages that I can list here. But does not work well with  local TV coverages. Cable works great for that. Saving a bunch.  Very easy to use. Only problem was opening the battery compartment on the remote. Had to go to Youtube to find out how to do it. This is a known problem with the Fire Stick."
"1633","Navigation is very easy. Haven't played with voice commands, hence no comments on that.The only negative is, it requires to be connected to a power supply. I thought it will draw the needed power from the TV itself."
"1634","Next to Netflix this may be the best invention ever!!!!  Plus you can use your Netflix account with this product.  I LOVE it.  Need a mental health day so that I can sit at home and binge watch all my favorites...Very easy user friendly....so much so that I purchased 2 more as Christmas gifts for my non tech family members.  They are that easy to use....The voice remote makes it pretty much fool proof.  You just plug it into your TV and sign in....Even my 65 yr old Dad can work it...and he has problems with anything tech related.  I've so bragged about this product that I also have 2 coworkers that have purchased this item also."
"1635","I am not very tech-minded and managed to get it set up and watch stuff.  Only hitch comes when I first switch to HDMI - It says ""detecting,"" then a few seconds later, says ""not detected"" and I have a blank screen.  I figured it wasn't working, but then it does when I just click the home button on the Alexa Voice Remote.  I also had to resize the TV screen to standard, using the TV remote, while still on the HDMI Firestick, to see how to do closed captioning.  It was a challenge but I managed to do it.  Can use the voice remote for searching, but the regular searching sometimes elusive."
"1636","I stopped watching cable television years ago. To watch I had to hook up my laptop to my tv (no I don't have a smartTv). Every time I wanted to watch Netflix or stream a video, or watch YouTube channels, I had to log into my laptop. With the Fire Stick I don't have to do that anymore. I can just turn on the TV and I get to use my laptop without having to interrupt watching a movie or show! Yee!! Cherry on the top is I can watch PRIME movies without having to always log into Amazon! Overall I'm very pleased with the Fire Stick!"
"1637","I use this with Kodi and downloaded some other things. Downloading was the biggest pain and confusing, so a computer is really helpful to goolgle  all the steps. Now done, the stick is great and I have countless programs to look at."
"1638","I had to get this for Amazon Prime as I couldn't use the Apple TV I have. It's ok, but prefer Apple as Fire Stick has no off or volume controls. Forces me to use two remotes for Prime. This is small enough to take with you, so I might try it in the RV"
"1639","We got this for our daughter's room. It's perfect for her. She loves that she can view YouTube video's! Streaming works fine for us. The set up was easy, as well. I felt like this was a bargain price for what you get."
"1640","Freedom! No more satellite. No more commercials. Great Amazon original series. This is how television should be. It was very easy to hook up and I haven't  had a single glitch. It's the golden age of television. Love it."
"1641","I have been using this Fire TV Stick for months now and all I have to say is, its the best investment iv'e had in my tv in such a long time.Here are the reasons why it is a great investment: - No longer have to worry about a cable bill or satellite tv bill, yearly contracts, cable boxes and all that junk ever again. Just plug into your USB in the back of your tv, and or anywhere where you can put a USB stick, and turn on. You literally have complete control over everything you watch. - You can pick and choose what you want to spend on apps and most are free to use (like CNN, NBC news, Cartoon Network and a few more).Sling Tv, or more recently, DirectTv App are good apps if you want a cluster of all cable channels, like AMC and such. Yes, some apps you do have to pay for, like Hulu and Netflix, but with what you get on both those, it still works out to be cheaper then Cable tv.Personally I use Sling tv, it's cheap and there is no contract, and even better it has all the channels I watch on regular cable, just with out all the other stuff that you don't watch. You can add certain channels if you like with your Sling tv, like Comedy, Sports and such, and then take them of when your done.Apps I have on my fire stick is, Amazon Prime (paid for one year, $99), Sling Blue ($25 per month, streaming on three devices at once). - The Alexa voice remote is fantastic! and easy to use, especially when you are looking for something, you don't have to go through all the apps looking for it, does it for you.It does take a little to get used to, especially if you are very used to cable tv, like AT&T U-verse and such, where you just turn it on and there is all your channels. BUT...you most certainly do get used to it after a few days or like me about a week or two lol!IF you don't like contracts, paying a Sh**t ton monthly on cable tv, and willing to learn and be patient with getting used to something like this, I would highly recommend it. Being a single mother, I like to have certain luxuries in life, like having tv shows I like to watch, and simply can not afford a high a$$ bill each month, wondering how on earth did it get to that much when I barely even have the tv on, the fire stick to me is fantastic and affordable."
"1642","Amazing! I used to have a blue ray dvd player for watching Netflix and it wouldn't let me use the amazon prime movies...so I bought a Firestick and am sailing along smooth as silk!Beat the crap out of paying $85 for a dvd player I never really use just to watch Netflix!Thanks Amazon!"
"1643","I have not had a cable bill in about 7 years or more, so we were using aa antenna where the reception was really bad. I had been thinking about getting a Firestick for months I did the research which was good. I am so glad that I made the investment, the reception is really good."
"1644","Easy to set up and use, works great. Had some help from Amazon Help Desk with a few issues. Am able to download movies, opera andclassical music at no cost with prime membership. Ordered 2nd one for the bedroom."
"1645","I'm really enjoying this firestick. I particularly like  all the different options I have...checking out all the apps and clicking on whatever program I want to view. And there are many of them.  I absolutely love it."
"1646","I bought it for Christmas but decided to take it on vacation the week before. Thank goodness I did! The apartment we were staying in only had WiFi and the owner said that they streamed from the internet to the TV. Well, I got out the Fire Stick, my adult kids got it running and downloaded free apps of their favorite stations and away we went! After a long day of sightseeing, it was relaxing to plop in front of the TV and watch our favorite shows. This is inexpensive and works like a dream. I can't believe this little stick can do so much! Now I just need to set it up at home. Well worth the purchase."
"1647","Definitely cut the cord!  I received my Firestick in November.  The firestick was easy to install with just a few clicks of the remote, then I easily installed the Kodi build and I gotta say, I have not watched the same program or movie twice since!! I am 64 and retired, so as you can guess my TV runs 24 hours a day.  There is just so much available with the firestick.  My favorite features are the tons of movies available, live tv,  and top of the list are the many ambient sleep sounds available.  I get the most restful sleep.  I have HD tvs but they are not smart, the firestick makes them a genius!"
"1648","SO convenient to have!! It seems limitless. When comparing the fire stick to Chromecast or rocu.... fire stick is our household favorite! Easy to travel with too for comfort of your favorite streaming programs in any hotel set up."
"1649","I had purchased the Fire Stick as a gift for my kids.  Based on their feedback, I bought one for myself.  My exercise room has an older, non-smart tv.  The Fire Stick allows me to watch from various apps and I love it.  Working out is much more fun."
"1650","I love using this for TV!  I have completely done away with cable.  I have Sling TV, Hulu, Netflix, and of course Prime.  My husband loves that you can just talk to the remote to look up shows.  Saving a fair bit over what I was paying for cable!"
"1651","Whew, where do I start? This easily puts my Chromecast stick in the yard sale box! I love the App. for it on my Smartphone too. It has so many capabilities I cannot cover them in this review but safe to say it has many things that one can access including the ability to program special software programs to customize its use. I highly recommend it and it's price point is just right."
"1652","Got this for our son.  Kids these days don't have cable TV -- they use this.  He uses his daily and my daughter has one too. Good customer service  and support if you need it too to get it set up or with any questions."
"1653","Runs fast and smooth. Interface is improving as time goes on. Problem is that Amazon crams many repeated suggestions and a ton of 'pay' titles that stand in the way of what i have already paid for. You can't customized much at all. Voice search works a little better with Netflix, Hulu, and Vevo, but it will still pull 'pay' titles up when the same free or subscribed titles are available.- having a network issue where the device is showing multiple MAC addresses under the same IP address causing my router to lock up almost daily. it is reporting 5 different MAC addresses for 1 IP address."
"1654","Works well. It's a little annoying that you need a computer to sign into new apps (you can't enter your user name and password on the device, you have to go to the site on a computer and activate it), but one you've activated them it's fine. It streams smoothly, the interface is good, and the fact that there's a remote (unlike with Chromecast) is pretty damn awesome. For those out there using Chromecast, wondering if the switch is worth it, I'd say it is. The connivence of being able to just press play on the remote and having all my apps right there on my television screen is worth the price to me."
"1655","Excellent product, but if you're not familiar with how to load the apps, go to Youtube for instructions. My only gripe is that Amazon would only sell one at the sale price. It would have made a great stocking stuffer. Amazon is short sighted. A gift would entice people to buy a Prime membership. I called the 4 people and told them to buy it on sale and I reimbursed them. BAD SHOW amazon."
"1656","previously said i didn't like it...couldn't get the program page to come up...after working with it, it works great now...techs were so nice to offer step by step help if needed...problem solved by un-plugging tv so it could reset..."
"1657","Just got rid of my cable and this bad boy has been such a joy! With my prime membership, I get so many movies and shows which I can enjoy for hours upon hours. It's easy to hook up and the tutorial is really helpful."
"1658","I already have a new smart tv, but adding this stick improved the speed and responsiveness while adding a world of new apps and games and adding live tv through Directv Now.  Plus Alexa too.  Well worth the 40 bucks."
"1659","I travel A LOT which means a lot of long hotel stays with average channel choices. My fire stick to the rescue!!! It is small, takes up no room in my suitcase and comes with a pigtail if you can plug in directly to HDMI port."
"1660","We love our fire stick. We do not have cable but with this you do that need it. We use it almost daily. The only issue we had was that it broke up the over the air signal. We used an HDMI cable to move the fire stick and noore issues."
"1661","I love that it's dual-band - hooked it up to the 5 band where it is the sole device with no noise and it is incredibly stable - I dumped cable and am now paying 25 bucks a month for sling TV on my main tv.  It's hard to beat that, and it's a testament to the stability of this device's connection.  And of course the amount of media available through its apps is almost overwhelming.  And, the voice control aspect is pretty amazing.  Finding content using actor names, category, etc is pretty nifty.  Have not had any issues with voice recognition at all.  Really can't say enough about this little gadget."
"1662","Supposedly suppose to have more power and stuff, but I didn't really notice any difference except the Alexa part that I never use and it just little bit larger than the older version. Rather than that I still love the Stick as usual. It does the job well."
"1663","Love the Fire Stixk but it needs improvements.  It needs a beeper locator.  This remote is so small it’s easily lost and you and replace just the remote so if you loose the remote younjust have to buy a new firestick.  I love it but it needs improvements."
"1664","I have 3 smart tvs and none of them would allow me to get certain apps that I needed. Fire stick got them and was super easy to install, gets a great signal and user friendly. Great price! Need one for each of my tvs!!"
"1665","This thing is super awesome!! We don’t have cable so we stream it on here and it works great. Also, it’s super convenient to bring when you stay at a hotel. We had to evacuate for Irma and used this daily while staying in hotels."
"1666","A little clumsy to operate.  Not sure what Alexa does since I never get the answer to my inquiry.  Preferences take many steps to activate and the captioning is very large.  Can't seem to change the size.  Not nearly as user friendly as Netflix."
"1667","I was afraid that I would not be able to figure out how to connect the Fire Stick to my TV.  However, it came with easy to follow instructions.  I had no difficulty at all installing it.  I don't have any trouble operating it either!  Would highly recommend!"
"1668","Absolutely,  incredibly, awesome""!!Thanks amazon for creating something to put these over rated,  over priced, cable companies out of business. Keep up the good work, because you most definitely have my vote..."
"1669","I Would have give this a five star but...... it must be plugged in constantly. How is this possible, when it's called ""fire stick"". A stick shouldn't have to continually be plugged in wasting energy, also it lost a star for packaging and instruction. Way to much packaging and not enough set up instruction."
"1670","I think it is going to be great. I have had some glitches with it, after every show it gives a sign that the connection is off to check internet. I don't check the internet I just press the button again and it comes up. Its just a little aggravating but I will keep it. I'm sure I can find the time to get it fixed."
"1671","This honestly exceeded my expectations. All the apps I was using on my Samsung Smart TV are on here and BETTER than what I was originally using. Not to mention that it receives wifi so much better than I thought it would. Even with the modem on the opposite side of the house to the point that the wifi on my computer is sucky, this things picks up our internet like it's right beside the modem connected via ethernet. It's so very nice. I""m very glad I made this purchase. The Alexa voice remote is also pretty amazing. I don't at all feel weird for talking to my remote. And I love that she talks back! It's so very perfect!"
"1672","Received today and took original Fire Stick out of service -- much faster -- better MMI -- will save more than  one WiFi source -- fantastic buy IMO -- now what to do with the old stick? I also have the original Fire TV cube as I call it and am waiting to see if Amazon is going to upgrade it's software or justify a replacement. As I don't game another stick might just be better than it is."
"1673","I am so happy with this latest firestick that we received last week.  I have ordered a second one that should arrive today.  I just love it so much, and it is so easy to use.  Haven't figured out all of it yet, but I am trying to get to know it better each day.I ordered one about a month ago, and it is I fear defective.  What can I do about it?  I don't have any of the paper work, but it just won't load and stay loaded, half the time, you have no voice, and it freezes up so much it takes the fun out of seeing a movie."
"1674","My ""dumb"" TV is now ""smart"" thanks to the easy installation and setup of this device. Got it just in time to watch season 5 of House of Cards next week as well as the many offerings available to me as a member of Amazon Prime."
"1675","As an avid Roku user, I was very skeptical. A few friends had recommended it and I made the switch. Oh, what a difference! I had switched to PlayStation Vue, a few months ago, and found that the app to be much better laid out. An incredible amount of content and even the games are more fun!"
"1676","It drops the link to Internet frequently if it's more than 3 feet from the wireless router.  The message on screen makes you think that your ISP is the problem, but we finally discovered it's been the Fire Stick all along.  From the reviews we've read, the Fire TV Box is much more reliable."
"1677","Easy to set up. Kodi was hard to set up. Still don't really understand how to use it to watch CNN, ABC, CBS.Plenty of movies. Wish I had a comprehensive manual on how to use. Easy to install. Not easy to understand."
"1678","Well we got it set up, and was watching the Fox channel, and in the 3rd quarter of the game it just cut off. .didn't see the end of the game. .question? ? Is it jail broken? ? Otherwise I love it. (Super Bowl game )."
"1679","The Alexa doesn't recognize my voice at all, but aside from that it works just fine. I think that the wireless function of my smart TV is better than the stick, but I have no empirical evidence to support my belief."
"1680","Received in a timely manner. Easy plug and setup. Streams well. Gets all the services that are important to us. Like non-commercial programming much better. Very small learning curve. Try it, you'll never go back. Enjoy."
"1681","I own an Nvidia Shield TV, and it was always tied up playing Sking TV,Netflix, or Hulu.  I could never play any games on it! I decided to drop $39.99 on this bad boy, and all I can say is WOW! This is great for streaming TV or Movies! Time to go play on my Nvidia Shield!!!"
"1682","Last year, I signed up for Netflix and bought a blu-ray player to run it through since I did not have a smart tv.  The connection was horrible....Netflix would start a movie and within two minutes it would revert back to the 25% loading screen.  My Amazon Prime app wouldn't even open.  It was super frustrating.  After I got the Firestick, I've had no problems!  The app load quickly, Netlfix and Amazon work like a dream, and I'm finally able to watch a movie in full without waiting it to load every few minutes.  I love the voice remote.  Set up was super easy and user-friendly.  I'm so happy I finally ordered it."
"1683","while it was easy to install it did not give me much. You have to have your own subscriptions to all the other services to make it work. I get the same programs by using my computer.the voice activation is kinda cool, the only reason I gave it two stars."
"1684","It will probably take a while before I figure out what all I can do with the Fire Stick. So far it is amazing. This, along with a couple other apps, allows me to watch almost anything. I highly recommend the Fire Stick."
"1685","This system was easy to install and operate. I have a flat screen TV that's over 12 years old and the Fire with Alexa works well with it. I heartily recommend this system for anyone fed up with your cable offerings."
"1686","I started using the ""Fire Stick"" in my bedroom and so far it has been useful. I also have an ""Apple TV"" on the main TV in the house and I found out that some of the APPS don't cross over. What I mean by that is some apps, ie... HBO Now, will follow the app store. If you purchase through Apple, you can't view on Amazon without purchasing it for that platform. But Hulu works great. as well as anything I can get to through my Amazon Prime account.It pays to be informed about how these things work if you have more than one type of steaming device on different TV's throughout the house.."
"1687","Smartest purchase in a very long time. I have a smart TV. The buffering was terrible. I could never use the smart features. Somehow the streaming is amazing with the Fire Stick. Now my smart TV is finally ""smart."" HIGHLY recommend!"
"1688","my only complaint is that it needs to be plugged into electricity to run and that the electrical cord is too short. I need to have it plugged into an extension cord. I have a Samsung smart TV with a LAN dongle which plugs into the LAN port without any need for electricity.The functionality is terrific.  And the setup was super easy and fast.  Easy user interface, too."
"1689","What versatility!  I am hoping to cut the cable cord, eventually, and this is a great introduction to streaming.  I just recently signed up with HBO Now and am enjoying the Game of Thrones through the App. Excellent!"
"1690","I bought the Fire TV stick on March 2, 2017. Right from the start it would get very hot, to the point to where I cannot hold it in my hand for more than 3 to 5 seconds. It still worked though. It is now August 26, 2017 not even six months later. It will not even boot anymore. I do not even get to the Amazon splash screen. I checked the HDMI port with another device and the port is fine. Not even six months and the device is worthless, two months after the 90 day warranty expired."
"1691","The FIre Stick works well.  The only thing is that it seems to need to be power cycled somewhat frequently in order to continue playing without needing to stop to load.  Otherwise it is great, easy to use and is a great value.  It helped me not have to buy a new TV when Panasonic stopped supporting Hulu Plus.  Thank you Fire Stick!"
"1692","I bought this since my old Sony blue-ray player was having a hard time dealing with the latest HD videos from Amazon and Netflix.  I'm very impressed with the device's ease of use, streaming ability and interface.  I have it connected to an Apple Airport (5GHZ) and it works flawlessly.  Screen updates in the app are fast, movies start to stream almost instantly and I experience no buffering or interruptions while viewing movies.  The voice remote is a nice addition and has no problem recognizing my deep voice. It is truly amazing that devices like this have become so inexpensive yet reliable and useful."
"1693","Alexa where have you been all my life. Im in love guys, we bought this because we wanted a little more variety other than Netflix and I was paying for a Prime membership so decided why not give it a try.  I paid $29.99 on Black Friday it was so worth it. This wasn't a replacement for my cable however it can be because I like others think cable is overrated and ridiculously expensive. My Hubby and I got into a few new shows we never even heard of I strongly recommend Goliath and Bosch. Alexa doesn't hurt either a handy assistant she is and it just makes the Fire stick better especially on lazy weekends."
"1694","Why I waited so long, I'll never know.  Super easy to install and use.  I'm very happy with it and highly recommend it.  Working my way towards dropping Comcast ASAP and looking forward to a commercial free life!!!"
"1695","I thought about buying an apple tv but since I have Amazon prime and I get videos with my prime subscription, it really made more sense to get the fire stick.  And I got two fire sticks for the price of 1 apple tv."
"1696","I love this thing.... the programming for it rocks and gives me another outlet if I do not want to use the roku. easy setup if you have an amazon account. it allows you to access all your Amazon apps on this stick."
"1697","Instructions for the product are very lacking, but after some trial and error, I figured it out.  Now I really like the way it works.  It takes me through the various services that list movies and shows I want to see.  I am still trying to learn the microphone part, but I am slowly getting there."
"1698","We have two Fire TV Sticks in our home and recently purchased one as a gift. By far, it is the best device to work as a central hub for all of your streaming services. If you don't have cable, or want to get rid of it; consider purchasing a Fire Stick. It will act as your ""cable box"" for Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go, Sling TV, Prime, etc. The voice command feature makes this a 5-star purchase. With the help of the Fire Stick, the move to streaming-only has been easy-breezy. We do not miss cable, nor does our pocketbooks."
"1699","I was doubtful about this product but after upgrading to prime decided I might as well make the most of the streaming service. This product is way better than I imagined. Very easy to use and I like the voice function."
"1700","The new Fire TV stick with voice recognition is very simple to use.  Alexa got it right every time I've used it so far.  I like that it says my command back to me before executing it.  Since entering commands with an on-screen keyboard is time consuming, the addition of Alexa is a great time saver.  I've played prime music and watched video on Netflix so far.  The Fire TV Stick was easy to set up.  I used the AC adapter supplied rather than plugging into an available USB port since that is what the instructions suggested.  No problems.  I am very satisfied, especially at the Black Friday price of $30!"
"1701","This works great, really fast at loading Net flicks and playing the movie. I pick out a show or movie and it buffers for just a second or two and the movie or show is playing in 1080p. I downloaded the game ""Up Hill Racer"" dumb little game but it plays great. I also use it to ask Amazon's Alexa questions through the microphone on the little remote control that comes with the Fire Stick. For not much money you now have a Smart T.V. I new I would like this fire stick because for over a year I've had Fire T.V. with the game remote hooked up to my main T.V. and of course it works great also!"
"1702","I love both my fire sticks.  Some of the channels need to upgrade and understand that a lot of people don't use cable and add fire stick to their list of providers.  Hallmark channel is a good example and it would be great if Hallmark Movies and Mysteries was a choice.  Thanks Amazon!!"
"1703","Had a bit of trouble connecting to the internet at first but once that ""self resolved"" the stick has functioned flawlessly.  I use it for Amazon prime and Netflicks movies, too cheap to buy premium channels"
"1704","Excellent device..  It really is.How ever not all apps can be sideloaded and the fact that all amazon prime features remain without being  able to remove the prime apps is the reason I give it 3 stars. Such a petty as this is an amazing gadget but is just cluttered without additional options to truly make it your own."
"1705","Love the fire stick, works great when your moving into a new area and don't have cable yet. I love being able to watch the new movies that come out for free, and go back and watch the tv shows series that I missed."
"1706","I can't be more happy about my purchase. How can something so small do so much for $40!!! Had it going in about 5 minutes. Also my husband has to wear headphones to hear the tv, our blu-ray player doesn't work with them but the Fire Stick does. Now Amazon Video needs to offer all the network channels and I would be set. Thank you!"
"1707","So, this is a double edged review.  Part one is on the fire stick/fire tv product and performance, part two relates to Amazon Policy and customer service.  So, for part one.. I give the product a 5 star review (when it's working), and for part two, I'd give it zero starts if I could... hence the two star overall rating.First, the product, works great, voice recognition is great, movies with prime are good and we've begun to build an online library of movies we've purchased, mostly classics that we know we'll watch over and over.  It's nice because you can take a stick with you when you travel, and have your own movie library with you without having to carry much with you at all.But, I'm going to spend more time on part two... Amazon Policy and customer service.  At this point, I have about 10 fire sticks/fire tv boxes through my house and one in a travel case.  I use them all as I don't want to have to move it around with me depending on where I am.  So, here's THE BIG PROBLEM.  Apparently, you can add other apps to the fire stick and people do this and resell them.  BIG PROBLEM is that Amazon arbitrarily decides you ARE a RE-SELLER if you own too many of them.  Now this is where the fun begins.  If you talk to the first line phone support people about this, they claim to know NOTHING about.  If you google this problem, it's easy to find.  But they know nothing.  I believe they are told to say that.  After getting really hot on the phone, I was transferred to a TECHNICAL SUPPORT person in the fire tv group, which indeed DID know about this and said I was flagged as a RE-SELLER.  I was told this would be noted and removed.  SURPRISE, two weeks later, my fire sticks are DE-REGISTERING AGAIN.  I really believe that Amazon believes their customers are stupid.  I would NEVER buy another FIRE TV product from them again and will start to look for alternatives and update this review when I find suitable alternatives.  As for AMAZON, I am going to become the BIGGEST PAIN IN THE REAR, as I'm going to push for a refund on all of my FIRE products, including a refund on all of the movies i have purchased to date (my collection is around 60 at this writing)."
"1708","The best idea Amazon ever had. The ease of setting this thing up is literally 4 steps and we suddenly had an extra smart TV.1. Open Box2. Plug into TV3. Sign into internet4. Confirm I am Rob"
"1709","i could not get it to work with my large TV. it works well, though. I am having problems understanding what all it can do.  it is just like so many other products, it works as well as you can get it to work.  Surprisingly, some of the older movies I wanted to watch cost a fee. I'm talking about movies that are over five years old.  One movies I wanted to see was over 20 years old and there was a fee attached.  The fee is not the problem, I was hoping that I would get more FREE movies that were to my taste. Well, maybe the fee is the problem. anyway, it is a great product once you figure it out."
"1710","I'm having so much fun with my Amazon Fire Stick.  Especially With Alexa.  I've watched shows and movies, played games and looked at my photos.  I've even gotten baseball scores and game times from Alexa.  And the weather.  So much more fun than my old media streamer. Thanks"
"1711","Love this thing! If you don't already have one you are missing out!"
"1712","We bought this October 29th and have replaced it already with a Roku stick. The problem for us was the image on the screen would not stay clear. We  would have to go into the setting area on TV remote and adjust the image there. It may not have been so bad if it stayed clear, but we would have to do that several times through out a one hour show. It was not easy to navigate the apps either as compared to our previous Roku, Since I did not return it earlier I am stuck with it. Maybe it will work better on my lap top, We replaced it with a Roku stick since our previous Roku model was no longer available."
"1713","This is the best streaming device I have found, and I have experience with Roku, Chromecast, Apple TV, and the previous generation of Fire Stick.  This iteration of the Fire TV Stick is far smoother than the previous one--not that the old one is any kind of slouch--and the addition of Alexa is nice.  It is smoother than Apple TV as well, and Alexa is far more useful than Siri.  It is easily more reliable than Roku.  I had a great experience with my Chromecast,  but, since your phone is your remote, it can be a drag when your phone battery is dead.To top it all off, the Amazon Fire TV Stick is the most versatile streaming device of the bunch.  It's the only one that combines voice support with Amazon Video and Netflix."
"1714","The fire stick was easy to set up and works perfectly. We disconnected our DIRECTV last spring and began streaming Hulu, Netflix, PureFlix, and networks on our devices. The fire stick allows us to stream using a TV so we can watch together. We use it a couple of times a week."
"1715","why anyone uses cable these days is beyond me.  This can do anything.  The biggest problems are it sometimes is slow and needs the cache cleared often, but it saves us over $120 a month since we canceled our cable"
"1716","Finally a replacement for Roku. Interface is just as quick and snappy but more interactive and modern, more games. Controller compatibility, etc  Also it's Kodi compatible - - that's sort of the icing on the cake."
"1717","This is a great device with many apps that we use every day! It is easy to use as well. I love the talk feature in which Alexa will guide you through the entire app. We have 2 in the house and would purchase another if we had another TV."
"1718","Piece of crap. Idk why it has so many good reviews amazon has got to be inflating the numbers or something. The thing is constantly freezing, crashing or just not loading anything at all. Submitted a support ticket and heard nada. Over it. This is my second one I tried the original one, returned it and tried this new one hoping it would be better. Worked for a few weeks then started crashing like the last one."
"1719","it says you get hbo and starz and cinemax but you have to pay by the month, what is that ,  its complicated because instructions have 3 steps so easy but no one tells you ;you have to get kodi for all the good movies,  okay its ok."
"1720","I am not happy with the remote control. It is always coming up with a message , that a new remote has been added. Plus I have trouble with the actual pairing of the remote.. I have 3 of the old model,  I have never had a problem with the remote.This new stick it works great once you get the remote to pair. It is a faster processor and you can tell.. but just remember that when streaming, your internet is the key.. check with your provider to check your MPS internet speed.i think you need at least 14mps to stream any video content, no matter what devise you use.So just 3 stars due to the remote problems."
"1721","Love it, didn't know how much till I stop paying money for Dish. You pay only if you want it. A lot on it is free, but I have netflix, which I had anyway and then hulu. So many programs. I have 2 firestick. Never had any problems with it."
"1722","I love it!! It tucks so neatly behind my tv and works so easily and effortlessly. The reception and the picture are so clear and so is the sound. The Fire TV Stick makes it so easy to be able to view great TV that is tailored just for me. Thank you Amazon!"
"1723","One of my favorite things ever. Just about everyone in my family has at least one and they all love them. Plug it in,hook into your wi-fi,sign into your Amazon account and you're ready to go. Well worth the money."
"1724","Finally I have streaming without the constant buffering I had with my Roku 3!  My Roku made everything virtually unwatchable, and was therefore useless, no matter how many fixes and calls to customer service I tried. My Fire Stick arrived yesterday, I did a quick and easy setup, and I've used it for hours with no buffering at all. I'm still getting used to the remote, but the voice search makes it super easy to find things. I just wish I'd bought one sooner."
"1725","Getting all the choices I like for viewing.  Great quality in both reception and visual display.  The format that the fire-stick presents could be developed a little more helping me identify what Channels are free or not.  Many times I have to drill down into an application only to find out that requires payment. Also would recommend an easy to access selection of news channels.  I know they have them but you have to surf and search for a while to find them."
"1726","A bit bumpy to start with, but by unregistering and re registering it, got the home Screen gong and enjoying it now.Unfortunately it does nit have a sleep timer on it so if you're sleepy... don't start a show."
"1727","This might be the best thing I've ever bought. I have been paying 160/month for cable and internet. Now I have Hulu, CBS ap and Amazon prime. Basically 20/month for the tv and 20/month for the internet. And I have every single show I love to watch and more. It's amazing. This firestick is super easy to navigate- even my mom can use it lol. And it never lags. It's honestly awesome. Idk why I didn't get one sooner and ditch cable. If you already have a game console that has all the apps maybe you won't be as impressed lol but I think it's pretty nifty and you can't beat the price! Def recommend."
"1728","There is a lot to like with this, particularly for those who want to cord cut. With Android programs like Kobi and others, there is a lot of content available, from movies and sports to TV shows. However, it is not perfect. Live TV is probably the iffiest feature of the stick. It tends not to work at all or to cut in and out. Also, it is EXTREMELY finicky in connecting to a network. It took me six hours to get the stick to connect to my wifi. Once I got it going, though, it seems to hold the network pretty well. I would only recommend this to those with a fair amount of tech and network savvy."
"1729","I bought it to watch prime video, now it turns out that it is not available for the fire tv"
"1730","This is the greatest purchase!! Much cheaper than Apple TV, and in my opinion, much better. Came sooner than expected, easy set up, easy wireless connection, very fast. Definitely would recommend this product. Comes with batteries. I love the voice command option."
"1731","So happy that the Fire Stick got to me sooner that the shipping date said.  Connection was easy and after internet connection was done, my first movie was viewed.  I have to thank my friends for the recommendation.  Great so far!"
"1732","Cable used to know my name..No more my new love is Amazon's Firestick!!"
"1733","This thing is awesome. Bought it for my mom for her birthday so she could watch Netflix easier. I bought he a Samsung smart TV for Christmas last year and while she loves it, it does have its issues. The main issue with the TV was that it would not remain connected to the internet when turned off so starting up Netflix was usually a 5 minute process.That is no longer an issue. Fire TV starts up right away and loading Netflix now just takes about 10 seconds, most of which is user. Alexa works nicely but I can't really review that part as my mom doesn't like AI units and doesn't use it at all."
"1734","So far my husband and I have been very happy with the fire stick, it was purchased to replace our very old and outdated Apple TV and easily competitive with our Roku 3.  It is pretty user friendly and not too difficult to navigate.  I like that if we are using another HDMI output we can just hit the home button twice and it takes us back to the Fire Stick output.  The only difficulty we have had with it was the initial sound set up but a quick search and we were able to fix it in a jiffy.  I would definitely recommend this product to someone if they were looking to get into the streaming TV market."
"1735","I LOVE my fire stick tv!  My Wii wasn't cutting it anymore for watching Netflix and Hulu, and there are so many more options when it comes to watching shows.  I got one for my father-in-law and he loves it!  The price was great too!  It was very easy to set up (attach the two cords, plug it in to tv and then into outlet).  I like that I can ""ask Alexa"" to find me movies/tv shows.  We use it to watch clips on Youtube and there are ton of channels that I can check out.  We don't have cable and subscribe to Netflix and Hulu and now with adding the Fire stick, I really don't need cable."
"1736","I love it. Alexa works beautifully in finding the show or movie I want to watch. I still subscribe to cable for my husband' ESPN channels. But that may change as I get more familiar with all my Firestick has to offer."
"1737","So far,i have this unit for few weeks and i'm still trying to  learn how to use it... So far were great, except that i'm still relaying with the TV remote control for volume control...It will be great if the Fire TV Stick, beside the voice remote should have option manually volume control ..."
"1738","this has changed our life. til now we used the leaf for a tv signal.  we have a lot of prime videos. we have high speed wifi. I wish I had gotten the firestick sooner but I was loathe to get it if it was not easy to use or did not work at all.  the parent control is A plus.  we never used tv but we will not go back to the leaf antenna now. The Alexa option works, and is very useful.  thanks!"
"1739","Even though I would like to see the most current movies I don't approve of piracy. I watched Baby Driver and without question the movie was pirated. The sound was very bad, there were people getting up during the movie to leave and the entire screen was not shown because we could not read the test on the bottom of the screen. I DON'T APPROVE.When we have it connected to Alexa all the sound goes through Alexa for a Mono sound. We have to disable Alexa just so we have good sound.Other than these issues we have been amazed with the Fire TV Stick"
"1740","I have loaded the Netflix app. and the way we have to search is time consuming.  If we could put in an actor's name or a movie title instead of having to search through hundreds of titles it would make it easier.  Also, we are not clear if we go to another app. just how we pay.  Is it by the movie or product or is it by the month the way Netflix is.  We are seniors and most of what we want to watch are old movies or T.V. shows,  like 40's, 50's, 60's  stuff.  It seems there is not a lot of that available, or have we just not been able to figure out how to access it?"
"1741","The newest fire stick is a little better than the old one. We still get buffering issues. We were watching an amazon prime movie at 9 pm on a Saturday night and it stopped to buffer 8-10 times during the movie. Other times, it doesn't need to buffer at all.Where I'm really glad that it's finally dual band, it's still not quite there yet.We don't have ""geek speed"" dsl and I keep wondering if that's the problem? I wondered that with our old sticks as well!?But we haven't used it a ton yet, so if it gets drastically better, my review and rating will change to reflect it"
"1742","This streaming media player is pretty good. Has its own remote or you can download an app to use on your phone or tablet. All in all its a good product but integration of remote and menus not quite as good as competitor products. One major gripe about remote is home button is in bad spot, too close to play/pause button so I wind up hitting home instead. Home should be in a more secure location where you won't be using close by buttons to select or play items. I don't notice a problem with video quality when playing something but the screen savers have odd patterns in them, like signal noise."
"1743","I really enjoy the amazon fire stick with Alexa. It is one of the coolest products I have ever used. Got rid of cable and now I save over $1500.00 a year because I bought the amazon fire stick. This is a beautiful piece of technology that you can watch almost anything at the tip of your fingers or ask Alexa to search for what you want to watch. Thanks Amazon"
"1744","I guess it's slightly more convienent than plugging in a computer, but many of the apps do not work. ESPN and Pandora are two apps I use frequently on my computer that will not work on the fire stick. Also, it does not update automatically so we have to update one app at a time when there is an update. Kind of a pain, but it works well with Netflix and Hulu so maybe worth it."
"1745","Amazon fire stick is awesome. I like that you can use this with some many other channel apps. It's by far cheaper than paying for cable if you have the prime account. Even ordering movie channels are cheaper and you can turn them on and off anytime without paying all year. I bought this because my cable bill was getting to high but didn't want to resort to Netflix alone if I cancelled it. So glad I got this. You can save so much money a year with this and still watch all the great shows. Amazon makes amazing products."
"1746","Superior product, nice easy interface, user friendly. Gateway to all your favorite add-ons, Netflix, Crackle, etc.Alexa voice control nice added touch. Only fault I would find is the power must come from an outlet, rather than a usb input"
"1747","Absolutely love it!  Was a bit challenging for me to set it up!  Although my TV is a smart TV, it did not have the Amazon App so had to download the fire stick.  Once I discovered how to do it (which wasn't all that hard) I was able to do it easily and am now enjoying it very much.  I do somehow think the ability to set it up became more my problem then the Fire Stick.  It's really an easy process but sometimes people make it harder than it really is......"
"1748","I love it, it is a great product and I don't have to go to the movie theater again to watch a movie when one comes out,I can bring it up on my television screen while the movie is playing in the theater, Or if I want to watch any other movieI can do a search and it will bring the movie up for me to watch. It is one of the best things that could have been invented."
"1749","Ditched Cable and went to the Firestick... LOVE IT!! I'm not using Netflix, Amazon Prime and Kodi. I don't miss a thing about Cable, especially the cost!!"
"1750","Ordered the Fire stick for a second home, rather than paying for cable all year long, I figured we would be cord cutters in the second home.  We have an amazon Prime account so we have plenty to choose from.  I can spend $8-10 dollars a month for an additional service and have practically everything we could want.  Since this is a vacation home, we do not watch too much TV anyway.  This will save me a bundle over the course of 12 months and I can watch the additional subscriptions on my tablet or phone also.  And with my new Amazon Dot I can put Alexa to work for me.  The automation bug has bitten hard!!!"
"1751","Love it! I bought mine from best buy however because amazon.com was out of stock for two weeks. It streams very well and it's easy to find ANYTHING with the voice command. :) The only down fall is you have to have it plugged in to the wall and tv at the same time or it won't work. That sucked because I was expecting to be able to just plug it into my t.v and when it needed to be charged, I could  then plug it in. So, you can't just take it anywhere unless they have a extra spot in the wall for you to plug it in. I could see this being a problem at a hotel for sure."
"1752","Had an AppleTV since 2012 (3G) and was looking to upgrade, so I could access Hulu's new live TV app. Fire Stick has literally every app I wanted. Only drawback: Can't play iTunes movies from my library + Alexa voice control (unsurprisingly) doesn't work in every app. Totally understand Alexa limitations; no worries there; would just be a delightful luxury if voice command worked *everywhere*. Best of all: It's totally hidden behind the TV in an HDMI port, which is perfect for my wall mounted TV."
"1753","Brought two fire sticks after 4 months the remotes stop working. Tried everything to repair it. Now I have two useless fire sticks. I tried using the app on iPhone but unfortunately due to moving and having new network the fire stick won't pick up my phone app. A waste of time and money. Your better off just getting a kodi box."
"1754","There is so much free content when you have Prime that this is the cord cutters dream. And I hear that Amazon is working on their own streaming tv service so this is basically the lowest cost option for tv there is and the menu is nicely designed and it's fast."
"1755","Brand new, so far so good.  Menu a little cluttery compared to roku, but it may be something I need to get used to.  My Roku started crashing, their support was awful, so I decided to switch.  Getting everything I want, and the price is right."
"1756","The new fire stick is so much better than the previous generation. Not slow anymore, the previous one is junk, too slow goodbye. I actually ordered a fire stick and fire tv in case the new stick was just as slow as the other one, I was not dealing with that anymore."
"1757","The All-New Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote works way better than expected. I'm still discovering features I didn't know it had and am continually surprised considering how inexpensive it was and how easy it was to install and set up. Way to go Amazon!"
"1758","I have the second Generation and it's a very fast capable device.I""m very satisfied that I can use the 5ghz band, as this will prevent unnecessary buffering.There's no 4ks support for this device, for that you'll have to spend extra to get Fire TV.For now this meets my needs 1080 video content, with Kodi installed makes this little device a must have for video content enthusiasts.Alexa does work pretty well, albeit not perfect, but it may take some practice issuing the correct command in the proper form, but she does perfom as expected."
"1759","I have been a Chromecast fan for a long time, but was looking for something new. I really liked the idea of having a remote and an interface that didn't require me to use my phone. I waited for the second generation stick to come out and purchased it right away. The interface is awesome and easy to use. The remote is great, its very slim but stylish and easy to use. The speed of the device is great for what I have been using it for. They make higher up models for users who want to play more graphic intensive games or want to add external storage, but for the average user this entry level model is just perfect."
"1760","This is great I can see live tv through sling and catch up on past shows through Hulu and it is almost as fast as my Fire TV. I didn't like the previous version because of wait times when opening applications, but this one is pretty close to the Fire TV. Easy to navigate and tons of options for apps."
"1761","Weeeeeee!Easiest product on the market to install and use.I have an older TV (it does have the appropriate connection portals on the back though it is a few years old) and I have a slow internet speed (DSL Lite) and it still works fantastic.  I  get a better picture quality with the Firestick than I do getting off the air free broadcasts signals.  The Alexa voice command works very well. I have no complaints about this product or its ease of use.Thank you, Amazon, for engineering a product that is easy to install and use.  And at a low sales price to boot!  :)"
"1762","We already had one that we use in our living room. It works well enough that we ordered two more. We use the direct tv app on ours and have also loaded some free outdoor apps. I don't have much use for the Alexa."
"1763","A ""must"" for every Prime subscriber.  It makes it easy to access your movies, songs, Audible books, etc.  Alexa also is useful to  answer questions, tell you the whether or just  answer trivia questions."
"1764","Buyers remorse here.  I originally owned the fire tv, then bought a roku stick, and finally bought this.  The fire tv is by far the best option.  Roku has horrible selection of apps(they call them channels) but does perform really well for a stick.  The Fire TV stick has everything great the tv has but not the performance.  Constantly the stick freezes or just takes a while to respond.  If you ever try to do things in quick succession you won't be happy.  Also the main screen can take a while to load.  Seconds seem like minutes when you are just sitting there(I know ""First world problems"").  The fire tv has the best apps/channels and even allows kodi/file exporer which is a must if you store local content on a nas.  Roku has 0 support for a nas except for maybe plex but I don't want to hassle with plex.  Get the fire TV not the stick, unless you are like us and wanted something easy to install for a mounted tv."
"1765","Love this! Just about anything you would want to watch, you can access it through this. Setup was super simple, and there is NO buffering of the videos! Highly recommend."
"1766","This is my 3rd Fire TV stick!  We now have one on every TV in our house and cut our cable!  Love it!  I have tried Chromecast and other devices, but Fire TV is far superior and much easier without the hassle of having to use your mobile device or tablet and having it charged all the time.  It is also very easy to bring along on a vacation and use on any TV while traveling.  And if you have Amazon Prime, it's all that much better.  We use it for TV shows, movies, music, photo viewing, and games."
"1767","Amazing product. Does exactly as described. Of course, everyone knows about Kodi and yes it works on this product... but it also works well with Netflix and others. Very fast, easy to understand lay out, etc. all around recommended."
"1768","I have been enjoying watching what I want, when I want.  I am no longer to the cable companies. My only complaint is that my FireStick freezes from time to time.  I have to completely back out and then restart."
"1769","Does what it needs to on basic level. Some areas it could improve on:1. The Fire Stick OS doesn't properly inform applications that it's supposed to run in landscape mode, thus some applications will run in portrait.2. A native solution to use the remote as a pointing device (i.e. mouse-like interface) is needed as some apps don't support the cursor-style navigation required by the current3. The device does not support Bluetooth Smart (i.e. Bluetooth Low Energy) so a lot of the newer and more advanced keyboards / mice will not work with it"
"1770","It works pretty Good when it's powered up, which I Have To UNPLUG Then PLUG BACK UP EVERY TIME because it Says ""Weak or No Signal"" which seems bizarre because soon as I unplug and Plug back it loads right up, so this tells me there is probably some kind of software glitch somewhere or perhaps the USB Power cord..It's becoming quite annoying, It really is. I searched the Webs and seems this has been going on with quite a few people for quite a while..so disappointing in an otherwise decent product. FYI The stick is only 2 weeks old..not even quite 2 weeks.."
"1771","I wish the product page for the device was better so I could more easily recommend the second generation device to people that did not like the first generation device many years ago. To those people, it looks awfully similar, but as someone who obsessively follows Amazon's TV efforts, I know that this product is compelling. I really like the new UI that was added after the launch of this device, as well as the broad support the device has with third parties. Alexa is the absolute best thing about this device, and a wonderful way to navigate to the content I already know I want to access."
"1772","It took about 10 minutes to free it from the packaging and another 10 minutes to pry open the battery case, but from there I set up everything seamlessly in less than 5 minutes. The annoying packaging/battery case are the only reasons I'm rating it a 4; it would be an easy 5 if those issues were corrected. So far it's working great; always remembers the last 3 or 4 shows or apps I watched most recently. I like it about a thousand times more than the Apple TV I used to have, which always sent me back to the main menu after I used it. I just ordered a second one; on backorder unfortunately!"
"1773","I ordered this on Jan 1, 2017 knowing that it's backordered and sold out everywhere. It wasn't supposed to ship until Jan 17th but I got an email saying it was delivered yesterday!!! Eeeek! I literally just drove to my mailbox and had it set up within 5-7minutes!!!! Super easy to set up and I can already tell I'm going to LOVE this product!!!! I'm actually about to order a couple more for the tvs in our house that aren't smart tvs.I only wish I would've heard about this product sooner!!!!If you're thinking about getting one just do it! The price is great and so is the product!"
"1774","This is like night-and-day over the 1st gen stick, which had become practically unusable for me. It's almost comparable to my 2nd gen Fire TV box, in terms of performance. An absolute steal at the current price."
"1775","Decided to get rid of cable so I purchased the TV Stick and bought a $12.99 antenna for network channels. I'm embarrassed that if took me so long to make the switch. So much money wasted! The combination of the two is better than anything cable can provide."
"1776","I'm just getting used to using it but have highly recommended it to my friends.  Our son programmed it since we aren't too tech savvy, however,we are using it and if I was more tech savvy, I would rate it a 5 star.  Our old one didn't last so as we use this one, I hope it lasts and that we don't have to start over by relearning how to use the tv.  We just want to enjoy."
"1777","I was reluctant to buy this for my only none smart TV.  The fire TV stick is way better than my smart TV interfaces and moving forward I will purposefully be buying none smart TV's in order to use this interface as my main browsing interface.  Its really nice well integrated and set up is easy."
"1778","Best thing I've ever done was buy  this. I've should of done it sooner. Easy install & all you have to due is set it up and your off and running. Having Amazon Prime is a plus. We added sling and couldn't be happier!!"
"1779","Not the most user friendly remote or screen menu, but it beats watching shows on my computer or kindle.  Easy set-up instructions. The set up was not complicated at all, except for digging out my wifi password."
"1780","I like it. I don't talk to it, so the remote is pretty much like the one on my older AppleTV, but with a home button. That's a nice touch.The menu system is a bit jumbled/cluttered, compared to AppleTV, but I'm adjusting to it.It was very easy to set up, Amazon gets 5 stars for that.And yes, Amazon, I did receive this on the expected date, and it works great (Amazon thinks the package is lost and damaged in the mail)."
"1781","The Alexa addition is nice. I've always used my smart tv for Netflix and Amazon Video, but this has more options with the apps that can be added and using Alexa is super cool. Had to buy another for my bedroom TV that isn't 'smart!'"
"1782","I canceled my cable. As of this writing I have had my old Firestick for a little over a year and the last time I watched tv was the super bowl.I got this one for my mom. She's not real tech savvy, but seemed to pick it up easily with a 2-3 minute crash course. Now she's binge watching ""Criminal Minds.""One caveat. It doesn't come with a printed manual, so if you have problems with navigation and use, try the help section. It's marketed for is youngsters who grew up with digital technology, and we can pick it up instinctively.Overall a great product, and saves a ton on cable/satellite."
"1783","I bought one for our vacation home that I don't want to use Comcast cable. Cable is simply too expensive considering we only visit the house mostly during summer. What I did was to have a T Moble hotspot that gives me free streaming and use fire stick to get moves plus sling TV. This little device is absolutely working well. It has tuned well to eliminate buffering. The video quality from T Moble LTE is amazingly good. Thank you for my friends at Amazon. You keep doing great things! I just placed another order to use at our main residence and is getting gcrid if Comcast. Cable has to go."
"1784","It is one of the fastest streaming players I have purchased. I love the fact it is integrated into my YouTube app on IOS so all I have to do to turn on the TV streaming my YouTube video is to hit the icon. The only issue I have so far is that they did an update which caused my player to not display the video. I restarted the device and that problem was solved. It is much faster than my old Sony blue ray player and easier to use. It is simpler than my old Amazon Fire TV player (that broke after an update). The simpler, the better. It is cheaper than Fire TV and I am just as happy with it."
"1785","This was given to me as a gift, i had a first gen Roku that was literally dying., i went back and forth looking at the options. I wasn't sure about the Fire stick, in general it had good reviews but mixed ones as well. Unsure about the issues with the cover over the batteries i have read about, but it is simple to open and use if you take a quick peek at the instructions.It is simple to install, and practically sets itself up. Ultimately it works wonderfully, it is easy to operate, and combined with my Amazon prime, it has so many features! love love love the voice function!!"
"1786","the 5-Star rating should say it all, but if you have any doubts, this is the way to be done with cable!!!! I chose the PlayStation VUE and get more stations on the lowest plan. I get all the stations I got with cable plus many more. I also added Amazon Prime. i am getting SO much more that I don't even know how much it would cost to come anywhere close from cable. So if you want to save money, plus get more stations, movies, sports, etc. Fire Stick with Alexia is the way to go. Oh, and to get local stations,the best indoor HDTV antenna is the Leaf 50. In one room I get 40 local channels."
"1787","Wow, this is cool! Super easy to set up and I finally get to watch my Netflix ! You get free trials for other programs also."
"1788","we love our stick it has a great deal of apps and it is easy to install also you can talk into the remote that is good for when you can't find what you are looking for it just comes right up. We use to have a Roku but we like this much better"
"1789","I love this baby!! I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I think I might buy one for every TV.Just press the button and ask to play holiday movies and a list comes up. Or ask it how to spell a word. Or the weather. Or almost anything else. This is way better than any other competitor products. I have the Chromecast and for the same price range this is so much better!"
"1790","I bought this for traveling. I'm surprised at how easy it is to use. Basically I just plugged it in and went from there. We were using our Xbox for Netflix and Amazon, but now I just use this to stream movies."
"1791","This is great! Pretty much plug and go. When it turned out my smart TV was not all  that smart we got this to watch Amazon Video. Fast streaming  with no buffering , voice search and a handy app for my phone ."
"1792","The Fire TV Stick works quite well from app to app. But it has a tendency to freeze occasionally after a movie.  A most of the apps require a monthly fee after a free trial. Do like that you have Alexa to take commands."
"1793","Entertaining myself has never been so difficult! I have Amazon prime, yet all the programs I want to watch are already on Youtube. Maybe I need to try the voice recognition. This device seems really difficult."
"1794","This device is brilliant, so small and unobtrusive yet lightning fast, smart, and full of features. I love the voice remote, you hold it down while you talk and it responds within a second. This was well worth the money."
"1795","Works great we are streaming Hulu , Netflix, CBS all acess , and Directv Now and no issues with the device what so ever. We are having issues with Directv Now but thats not the fire stick it is them. We love the Fire Stick"
"1796","It's ok. I have another Roku device that is much easier to navigate. Be aware that Alexa only works with Amazon Prime. I didn't see that anywhere, so I thought I'd pass on that tidbit. I do like the remote. It feels very nice in my hand, is easy to hold, and it's Bluetooth, so it's not necessary to point it toward the TV. End on a positive!  Edited:  after having the firestick a while, I like it now better than the Roku for the reason of the remote. It just took me a week or two to figure out how it worked. It much like all streaming services. I would recommend this product."
"1797","We are so happy that we purchased the Amazon Fire Stick. There are things that you can do without the Amazon Prime membership, but we decided to become a Prime member and that only made the Amazon Fire Stick better. There are tons of really good shows, plus we got free 2 day shipping on all orders, unlimited Prime Photo storage and with the Amazon Echo, we now have Prime music throughout the house. We are now thinking about getting Amazon Fire Sticks on all 5 TVs that we own."
"1798","Most incredible bargain of the year! New TV placed on Fire TV box ver 1 for optical audio output and the new Fire TV stick relegated to the bedroom TV; but, not for long. The new stick gives a better picture (HDMI 2) on the 4k TV, which has its own optical output for sound, and  SPMC installed and works flawlessly on the stick's improved processor and wireless performance."
"1799","I was happy it arrived before Christmas even though it said a later arrival date. My husband was so happy to receive this gift. It was easy to set up and the voice control remote makes finding shows to watch and music to listen to so easy. No more typing out show or song titles. I can finally work my TV and access Netflix super easy -all with just talking!! Awesome device!"
"1800","I received this device 3 days after and it was amazing. I was hoping to get prime day deal as last year but didn't get.It's easy to set up and easy to use. Picture quality is amazing. Interestingly my TV remote also works with fire stick. However its own remote is even more amazing with Alexa.I would certainly recommend this to anyone."
"1801","It's good...Sometimes it isn't as responsive but it's very handy to have if you enjoy watching YouTube, Amazon video, or Netflix.And I didn't even know you can download games and play on your TV as well which is a big bonus.If it was more responsive to the remote, it would have been a five-star. But for $40,  ya it can't beat it!"
"1802","Remote is ergonomically clumsy to use compared to the Roku I replaced it with. Also seems to load apps and programming slower than Roku with a less intuitive interface on screen. The so-called ""voice search"" is very biased to find only amazon products and is completely useless on a quality service like Pandora. What's the point of a biased search? -- To get you to buy amazon movies, TV programs, and music instead of using the services you have already subscribed to outside of Amazon! NOT RECOMMENDED, even if you like and use Amazon Prime for almost all online shopping otherwise."
"1803","Pretty great little thing!  Loads quickly and is easy to move from one room to another.  2 things I bought this thing for specifically.....one was because it can access Sling TV, which is awesome by the way.  Secondly it has voice activated searching.  Just talk to it and it searches.  I don't use it very much, but it seems pretty accurate.  It not only will search movies and such, but if you ask it the weather, it displays it.  Ask it where to buy a pizza, it shows you local pizza shops.  Pretty cool. Bought this on Black Friday at Best Buy and it was a great deal.  Very happy with it!"
"1804","This is a great product and far outperforms Apple TV (version 3). I've installed both Fire Stick TV for a friend and it works better than my older Apple TV.  I cannot compare it to the current version of Apple TV"
"1805","I am so happy with the Fire Stick after paying a load of $$$ for satellite!  I recommend this to anyone that wants quality television at a much lower price than satellite.  Excellent Quality.  Price is incredible.  Prime offers SO MUCH without having to purchase other products."
"1806","We love the Fire Stick. With the price of cable and satellite T.V. now at ridiculous highs, we decided to cut the cable. We purchased a Fire Stick for the main T.V first to try it out and now have one for each T.V. in our home. The device is easy to use, with most options being accessible with three presses of a button. The Voice Remote aspect works well and picks up the request much better than Siri. As long as you have reliable internet, the Fire Stick is the way to go!"
"1807","Love it!!!! Now I can relax cozy warm under my electric blanket and watch from my bed on my HD TV all the shows that I used to watch from my laptop sitting at my table and enjoy a bigger screen too!!! Greatest little invention!"
"1808","I bought the Firestick after using it at a friend's house to watch first-run movies.  It doesn't come with instructions to download Kodi, the app needed to see free movies. I was able to finally install it from watching a video or two on U-tube, and it worked the first night.  The second day,  I couldn't get any movies, or anything.  I may have to reinstall it!  It was a pain to install in the first place!  So far,  I'm not too happy with the purchase!"
"1809","I have one of the original fire sticks and it works just fine. This one however does not. Even after replacing the batteries, the remote stops working. and I need to do some combination of popping the batteries out and back in and unplugging the device to get it to work again... for about 30 seconds until it stops working again. The tech support on these devices is lacking. I'm considering buying a different product."
"1810","I'm SO GLAD I finally decided to order this fire stick! This thing is absolutely awesome, I love it! I really wish I had bought this a long time ago. Just plug it in to start using it, so simple & easy. Finally able to watch my video library & streaming movie rentals on a big screen TV,  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
"1811","I like my new Firestick, although I'm not big on talking to my devices. The one issue I've found is that I've lost connectivity a few times when using the remote as a game controller. This never happened with my older Firestick."
"1812","I like parts of the FireStick-clearly I like the internet TV ability to ""cut the cord"", and the fact the TV runs while the guide is up is nice (unlike Roku).  I don't use the voice function much (I use VUE, and it doesn't work well for VUE), but I could see it working for others. I also like you can pause a show on kindle Fire and then start up again easily on the firestick.My biggest complaint when I compare to the Roku stick is that the Amazon Firestick is significantly slower to load up-both the stick itself, as well as any apps.  Almost 3-5X as long as the Roku."
"1813","Pros:YouTube, Netflix, Amazon video and moreApps and gamesSome skills workCons:900ma power use when activeWhen it hibernates, it won't turn the TV off with it ( please address this Amazon, a signal or full output cut works)"
"1814","Am a little upset right now to be honest. I purchased this fire stick after xmas and use it occasionally. I was using it this afternoon when it went to a black screen and then said searching for remote. I have been messing with it for 2 hours... tried unplugging, new batteries in the remote, resetting the remote and moved closer to the actual fire stick... nothing has worked. I am so aggravated. Nothing else will show up on the screen and the remote will not work. Ughhhh"
"1815","haven't tried it, but didn't want Alexa voice but there were none available without it. :(  I would rather push buttons then talk with a machine. My last fire stick works fine, but i wanted one for another tv"
"1816","This little stick is great don't want to pay for cable anymore"
"1817","Does a fine job in are bedroom showing movies on amazon prime!"
"1818","I have always been a fan of the Roku but the Fire Stick has a much nicer/smoother interface. I'm quite pleased with this purchase!"
"1819","Still getting accustomed to using this in our efforts to rid ourselves of a high cable bill. But I think the variety it offers will certainly satisfy our entertainment needs in the long run. Very glad to have this option."
"1820","It works OK. Plan on 20 minutes to set up your account for Hulu, Netflix etc.  The voice command will not take you directly to you show on non Amazon APS.  In fact it will try to take you to the show on the Amazon app first.  I know that might sound picky but if I started a series on say Netflix it already knows where I left off and the Amazon app might want me to pay extra for that show as well. It's a great concept very that is almost to where I would give it 5 stars.  Right now 3.5.  I know it shows 4 above but you can't do halves.  I gave Amazon the benefit here because I'm a fan."
"1821","I really am enjoying my fire stick. It was easy to install and easy to use. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I cannot get my Vudu app with this and I have a lot of movies on Vudu and it is only place I buy movies. So I was really bummed when I couldn't get the Vudu app. Other than that I am really enjoying the fire stick!"
"1822","The fact that I was able to get rid of cable that is a big plus. I am happy with it because I can costumize my channels, I am getting use to it . I got 3 for each tv and it is a lot easier to activate than Apple TV"
"1823","Being summer i have only used it a couple times but it works perfectly. Glad the wifi quit on the dvd player or i would have not gotten the Fire Stick. Best thing to happen. No issues yet and hope to have none."
"1824","I bought the Firestick for access to the native Twitch.tv app.When comparing to the AppleTV, the interface for the Firestick feels really cluttered for navigating Apps and videos.  There is so much available I don't know where to begin.  It is hard for to discern suggested Videos/Apps from apps that I have access to.If it were not for the favorites bar, or recent list, I wouldn't be able to use the Firestick."
"1825","Really enjoy this.  Easy to set up.  Turned my old not so smart TV in to a smart TV!  Accesses my 5g internet movies seem to be better quality picture and sound. Voice control is real easy.  Glad I purchased the Fire TV Stick ."
"1826","We have had issues with our smart tv and the internet connection. My cable provider reccommended that I purchase this stick. So glad I did as it was so simple to set up and it worked fantastically immediately. Hopefully now I will be able to view all of the streaming services without any issues. Thinking of purchasing another one for another TV."
"1827","Even us seniors figured it out.. ha and it's terrific.. The only thing u have to do is use the source code to change back and forthbetween tv and Amaz but it's a small thing... Already watched a movie!"
"1828","You can't beat this little device especially if you already have Amazon Prime.  The voice search is great, even the kids can dot it, and the portability can't be beat.  I can move it from TV to TV with ease."
"1829","Much faster than the 2 Fire TV Sticks I currently have.  Like the novelty of the voice remote and being able to call up videos and music quickly.  I can also now turn on the lights with the remote.  Remote seems kind of flimsy, but I got this on sale through my Dot and got a gift card so I ended up with more than a expected for that price.  This one stream faster from my PLEX server also, so I assume the WIFI is much improved also.Not enough for me to buy 2 more to replace the older 2 I have, but if I start using the other TV's a lot more I certainly would think about it."
"1830","I was originally bummed about the fact when you say, ""play Paw Patrol"" - the first and default option is to purchase the season or episode. The previews made it seem like you could stream anything (without paying). But overall, this is a good product. We can still find mostly everything and yes we do have to buy them.Only other issue is sometimes it's slow or it takes a bit to respond."
"1831","We just began using the fire stick, but so far so good. Easy set up and installation. We needed the extender, very considerate Amazon. We discovered another company does not include it. We've got to get more subscriptions, but compared to cable/satellite costs it's less expensive. I give it 4 stars because we haven't gone through much more than Netflix which works great."
"1832","Finally upgraded my TV and streaming service from Roku to Fire Stick. Very good so far, I just wish the Fire stolick had more independent channels like Roku does. If not fornthat it would receive 5 stars from me. Other than that its an excellent product."
"1833","I had to wait over a month for this but it is worth it. Picture is great didn't have any freezing so far. I have a chromecast that I am so mad I wasted money on because I could have gotten two of the firestick. This a great little device and have Alexa is great too. Very good deal."
"1834","After Roku, the Fire Stick isn't as intuitive, nor any better regarding buffering.After several months use, the FS stops working on whatever channel being watched, have to up or down surf  a channel and then return to watch the original channel again!"
"1835","Very user friendly, I love the remote as well as the speech capability. Any problems I've had with this have been on an app-by-app basis. My first week that i received this I was sick in bed for several days, and this was with me every step of the way. Several seasons of The Office, hours of YouTube videos, and numerous Twitch streams later, I knew that this was a very fine product."
"1836","No volume control!  In addition, the interface can't be customized much at all.  Many categories and icons I don't use often couldn't be removed or moved.  The universal search feature is nice, but what good is a remote without volume control?  If you get this because of price, be ready to juggle two remotes or pay for an ""add-on"" or fancy third party remote without voice control.  I'd recommend a Roku instead, allows more configuration and has volume controls."
"1837","I've used virtually every streaming device you can think of (Roku, OG Apple TV, Xbox, PS4), and somehow, the Fire Stick has managed to be my favorite out of them all.  The interface has a lot to do with that.  The Alexa search is super helpful, and the way content is laid out in a way that puts movie/show choices ahead of the app their found within makes for a more natural way to find things.  The processing power behind this little stick is impressive also; navigating and pulling up movies takes no time at all.  For the price it's practically a no brainer to own at least one of these."
"1838","Love the voice feature and it is way faster than the other model"
"1839","The remotes suck! They along with the app constantly disconnect, even in the middle of scrolling. The pause, rewind and fast forward don't work either, they just make the buffering worse. Haven't found any good streams to watch TV shows on."
"1840","We got our first Fire TV stick from DirecTV Now when we signed up during their initial rollout.  We found it so easy to use that we purchased two more for our other TVs.  Easy to install, even easier to use!"
"1841","Really dissapointed in what is available as ""free"" shows and movies when you have a prime membership and the domestic. I originally bought the google chrome cast thought I would get a huge amount of free shows and movies being I was a prime member.  The voice active remote works great, the design of the hand held is very well done, very simplified, sleek and relatively small."
"1842","Works fine.  Got it free by prepaying 1 month of DirectvNow app and locked in the $35-month price for that service.  Good deal!  Would have preferred to use with my Roku, but the Roku app isn't available yet.  The app on the Fire TV stick works fine and I really like the app as I cut the cable cord years ago and I'm enjoying having access to some cable programs I couldn't get for awhile. Also like the low $5-month price of HBO through DirectvNow.  The reason I knocked down the stars is because Amazon signed me up and charged me $99 for their Prime service, even though I declined the option when I used the stick the first time.  It also tried to charge me a monthly fee for my Acorn subscription although I signed in with my annual subscription ID.  I caught the Prime charge immediately, cancelled it, and got the money back but this is the second time it's happened to me.  Amazon is so committed to getting you to take Prime you have to be vigilant.  I ended up removing my credit card from their system and now enter credit information only when I'm buying something, then following up and making sure they haven't stored it.  Very annoying."
"1843","It works Great and is an Excellent Value for $40.  I plugged in usb power to port on my TV and everything is hidden behind TV. I primarily use it with Netflix and Amazon Prime and it Works Well. I recommend"
"1844","I love Amazon!!!!!!! I love this Firestick! So easy to use. Love the display of all your music, shows and Apps and Alexa voice remote.I love singing along with the words of the songs on the tv screen. It's a must have!"
"1845","I have been using Apple TV, but now that I have  tHe fire stick I wish I bought it sooner. Netflix works in it plus a bunch of other apps I've had to AirPlay with Apple TV. Now I can just DL the apps right into the fire stick. Plus the voice control is aw some. Buy this instead of apple"
"1846","I LOVE this thing. The navigation is a breeze. It is much better than the Wii U setup, which makes it hard to find Amazon videos. The setup was a breeze. I like that it basically turns my TV into the ultimate entertainment system. I love that you can access Amazon Music through this device and stream songs in my living room's surround sound system, while displaying video/artist imagery, with some songs displaying the lyrics. It is so small and compact and a great price. I'm not a gamer so I'm glad I had this option to opposed to buying an expensive PS3 or better to stream HD video."
"1847","The first Fire TV Stick that I bought worked perfectly, so I bought another so we would have multiple in the house without having to unplug and put them into different TVs. However, the new one continuously freezes on me and refuses to download new apps when I select them. I reset it to factory settings, and the Fire TV Stick wouldn't pair with my TV until I used a tip I found online. After that, it continues to freeze and now says that apps I try to download are not found in the App Store, despite the fact I downloaded those same apps on my other Fire Stick. What is going on here?"
"1848","I bought this device to try out Sling. I found the Fire stick extremely easy to get working. I used it several days with no problem. I fired Sling.I watch Netflix and Hulu predominantly. After a few days I was experiencing the same difficulty that I had on Smart Hub. At least now when one quits I have a backup. The Fire stick quits in the middle of a movie and tells me my internet went away or jumps to the next episode whether it is done or not. The intent is awesome. The reality leaves a lot to be desired.Some one has a lot of work to do to get the flaws out of these things."
"1849","Set up quick and easy, no buffering problem, prime movies not as organized as I anticipated but I may not have figured it out yet.  This could be my start on navigating away from the cable companies, I hope"
"1850","Had trouble getting it set up after connecting it to my router via my password etc.  Kept saying it could not update.  Reset modem and router and unplugged Fire Stick for several minutes.  Took me over an hour to finally get it to to the point of letting me go into the settings and put in my Amazon ID etc.  Said that any prime member it would already be set up.  Well it is set up now an working wonderfully but not an easy process."
"1851","Bought this to replace my slow original firestick and it is a lot faster and everything loads smoother. I also love the included voice remote. Plus amazon shipped it sooner than expected, wonderful service!"
"1852","Only really use this for KODI but it works fantastically, had a cheap android TV box before this which came with KODI pre-installed and it was utter junk, crashed and froze all the time and decided to make the switch to this and just install KODI myself, which is incredibly easy btw, took me a total of maybe 10 minutes and followed a very simple and easy youtube tutorial. No issues with this at all, runs much smoother and haven't had any freezing or crashing. The size is also very convenient, nice and clutter free. Got this when it was $30 and might be the best $30 I've ever spent."
"1853","An excellent tool for watching Prime videos more videos and you can even count.  Took a little time setting it all up but now it works just fine had a bad flicker in it but once I change the resolution the Flickr went away"
"1854","This is the awesomest thing ever :)  No more trying to run my Prime movies or videos from my iPad through AirPlay and dealing with an occasionally unreliable network, and it couldn't have been easier to install. It's a 10."
"1855","Love it.  Don't understand why anyone pays for cable anymore"
"1856","Great product and the streaming keeps up fine with my wi-fi."
"1857","First version had become sluggish, overheated, and was pretty useless in comparison to my AppleTv.Now that I have the latest Fire Stick, I can flip through channels on DirecTV Now, my Tablo, and all the other Amazon menus. Much improved, and works so well."
"1858","So far performs Flawlessly. And the viewing image has awesome clarity. Have an apple TV and wish I could return it after getting fire stick. Works better than apple TV. A bit of a pain to stream from apple devices thru fire stick but there are apps and so far they perform well. Would be great if there was an app specifically for apple products for fire stick streaming."
"1859","Loved it at first, but, quickly came to realize that it is extremely slow...  I stream video on ipads/ipods/iphones and laptops from netflix and our cable provider and never have a single issue at all...  The firestick, however, cant seem to even make it though a single movie or episode without freezing...  Never seems to catch up and pauses multiple times throughout programs....  Could be a terrific device but it just doesn't stream well at all..."
"1860","40 bucks ,, not too shabby.  Works fine,  Nice to have Prime to watch that content. No problem adding other APPS like Kodi. Remote is quality made and there is a Fire remote app for my iPhone i use that's very nice to type in stuff."
"1861","Huge improvement over the 32bit model. Loads fast and have had no trouble so far"
"1862","This is outstanding!  I was able to cancel my current TV provider and save over a $100 per month!!!"
"1863","Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote is awesome! Super easy to set up and use! Works well! Should have gotten one long before I did! I am very happy with my purchase and have recommended them to many people!"
"1864","The fire stick is awesome.  We use it to watch shows/movies with our subscriptions to Hulu, Netflix, Sling and Amazon TV (included with our Amazon Prime subscription).  Cut our cable service down to basic saving us half on our bill.  We have the second best internet speed and our streaming is great with the fire stick.  It has a voice remote that my 73-year-old mom is using to watch her favorite shows.  Easy setup and a great way to cut the cable cord with access to so many applications."
"1865","I would give it five stars, but the batteries in the package were only good enough to get through the install. Long story...short...Check the batteries before you call tech support or think about returning the unit to the store.So, I was staring at the ""continue"" button after the setup was complete. Twenty minutes later the ""continue"" was still there and the remote did respond. I gave it a day and realized the Amazon Basic batteries that were in the Fire TV package were drained. I replaced the batteries and I have been watching movies and TV ever since.."
"1866","I like the concept of the product and I understand that you can update to a box style but I don't recommend this for a home system. I think it's great for travel and taking your ""TV"" with you but unless you are the only on signed in to your wifi, I feel like it's useless. I have really good wifi but the other day I had about 5 or 6 people over and was unable to use the stick because everyone is on the wifi. Again, I understand the reason it was slow  was because of this so if you plan on using it for home. I recommend the box version that can plug in directly to you modem."
"1867","In looking for ways to cut the cost of cable, I was reluctant to try a streaming device.  I even asked the salesperson at Best Buy ""does thing really work""? and I have to say she was right, it does!  The Fire Stick has been a pleasant surprise.  There are thousands of apps to watch sports, TV shows, and movies, and so much more.  I'm now saving about $75 month since dumping cable and switching to the Fire Stick.  It's very easy to install, set up, and maneuver through.  I would recommend it to anyone trying to keep money in their pocket and out of the cable giants pockets!"
"1868","The fire stick makes turning any TV into a smart TV extremely easy! It is almost much cheaper then other items that do this such as a Roku which we have as well. If I had known about the fire stick first I would have bought this!"
"1869","It works. It connects to the internet. Unfortunately, if you're not subscribed to several cable provided stations it's pretty useless. The voice control does work very good.Update: changing to 4 stars. We have grown to love renting movies with it, so much easier and convenient than trying to hit up redbox or a video store."
"1870","SO, I bought this SOLELY for my Beachbody on demand....I needed to be able to watch it on TV, THANK YOU AMAZON.  This was great, although I will be honest it took me about 24 hours to figure it out because I couldn't get the code to work until I went to work but that could be my phone and computer at home and have nothing to do with the fire stick.  I have it hooked up to the back of the TV and its so nice in the Morning to just switch to that input and im ready to workout almost.  I LOVE this product and I am excited to start exploring what else it can do and what I will be able to watch."
"1871","How I lived this long without this is a mystery. I absolutely love this! My wifi comes in so much better with the enclosed booster. So easy to navigate and the selection of apps and games is totally worth the price. Love it!!!!"
"1872","At first I wrote a good review but then the remote stopped working I've only had the device for 2 months smh I bought 2 sets of new batteries an it still won't work...I still love the fire stick but it doesn't work without a remote!!"
"1873","Just purchased my second Fire TV Stick. We live in an area where our only TV option is overpriced satellite (no thanks). We use our Fire TV Stick every day to stream our favorite shows and movies. I don't really use the Alexa Voice options, but it does work and is helpful when you're searching for something instead of having to click through the keyboard."
"1874","It was great while it lasted.  Had it for about 4 months, then it began freezing up intermittently and after another week of frustration it finally quit working altogether.  Of course warranty was only 90 days.  What made it even worse was Amazon told me 3 weeks for delivery. Of a new unit.  Ended up Best Buy to buy a timely replacement.  Huge Bummer!!!!!"
"1875","I got this just to watch CNBC from my TV. Everything EXCEPT that works great! CNBC locks up, just plain won't come on OR gives me ""Whoops that video is not playing"" . Or just sits There saying it is loading. Needs work to be of any use."
"1876","It was very easy to install and to use. I just got it for less than a week, so that I am not familiar with all the functions of it. It is worth of buying for the price and for the entertainment it can bring to you."
"1877","Absolutely love the Fire Stick.  I have 3 Rokus and the Fire Stick beats them hands down.  Better selection, better resolution, better sound,  just better all around.  I now have 2 Fire Sticks and will soon have 3."
"1878","This is quite an amazing device, it seems to work perfectly, but you doNeed good internet. I have not explored its full potential yet, but i am streaming music and watching Star Trek so far. Suffice it to say it doesWhat it is billed as and does it almost immediately. Thanks Amazon."
"1879","I was viewing streaming videos on my DVD player, but switched to the firestick and the difference was amazing.  So much easier, so much faster.  My contact at customer service was outstanding. Very happy customer."
"1880","I absolutely LOVE the Fire TV Stick. It's the best thing since sliced bread!! lol. Bought one for my son and he loves it along with his daughter. It is well worth it.  So many choices you don't need cable."
"1881","I am quit pleased with the services and functionality of fire TV stick and the deviydoes everything it is advertised to do. However, I was disappointed at the fact that the stick needs to be plugged in to an electric outlet in order for it to work. From my stand point, that defeat the purpose of the stick.If you are buying the fire stick because of portability and the capacity to use it on the go, keep in mind that you will need to connect it to an outlet whenever you go so you might be better of getting a stick from the competition if portability is the most important thing"
"1882","Thought my new stick was broken, but actually learned we had an issue with our $500 EERO fancy WiFi.  A domestic had unplugged the middle unit, which triangulates the system.  Though we saw we had a very good signal, when Amazon Techie tried to help, it wouldn't work.  Now it does fine."
"1883","This is the perfect accessory if you have an HDTV that isn't a smart tv, and even if you do have a smart tv, the Fire Stick is still better. It adds Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, and tons of other apps that you can use to watch all kinds of shows, movies, etc.It is easy to set up and use. Please note that you do still have to pay for subscriptions like Netflix, but this device puts all of that stuff in one convenient place for you. I wish I had known about this before I bought my HDTV. I would have skipped on the smart tv and used that money to go a couple of sizes up."
"1884","This Fire TV Stick replaced an original Fire TV Stick that stopped working after a couple of years.  The old one was a little slow at times, had to wait a while for certain things to load and it was annoying.  This one is faster, not as fast as the Fire TV Box that we have, but for less than half the price it's a good deal.  I'm hoping this one lasts longer than the other one it's replacing.  The older one didn't have the voice remote either, I'm actually using the voice commands more now. All-New Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player"
"1885","Once I got them programmed they worked pretty well.  It took some assistance from a younger (much) who actually is the person who told me about the fire stick and I'm going to save a lot of money after getting rid of my Uverse system.  Saving nearly $1300 a year just from going to this system and we can see about all we want to see on the TV.  sometimes it will miss voices but for the most part it isn't a big deal to me.  Not enough to complain since I'm saving so much money now.  Would recommend the already programmed one if you don't have someone who can program the fire stick."
"1886","Great Product for those who have taken back control of their TV's by streaming in lieu of Pay TV. The only thing firestick is missing is the Halmark Channels. We had to go with Sling (pay tv) for our favorite programs."
"1887","Love this device!!! It has so many options to use..you can set your own screen saver based on what ever.. easy to use and easy to set up.. I don't think I will be going back to cable TV..I just added sling TV and I get the channels I want at a fraction of the price.."
"1888","Love this thing! Probably will order another for more TVs. Easy for kids to use too. Now if I could just get my husband to ditch DIRECTV. But his beloved college football and basketball keep us tied up. Boo!"
"1889","I have a fire stick which I have on an older HDDV that does not have apps on it. The fire stick updates the tv  so I can watch Netflix's amazon prime movies and music. The fire stick loads up quickly, and I can easily add new apps. I purchased a second fire stick to use in my camper. The campground has basic cable tv this brings more entertainment to the camper as long as the campground has wifi."
"1890","This product is very much like an android device, not smooth and doesn't work well. Example, it has no idea what my tv screen size is (it thinks screen is slightly bigger) and there is nowhere to change screen resolution on device."
"1891","Easy to use, and radio frequency remote control is nice.But it falls short of the Apple TV and Chromecast.  I have both other options.AppleTV is better because it's processing speed is just a lot better, and you can stream from your personal devices, as well as having a volume control on the AppleTV remote control.The Chromecast is better because it allows you to cast from all my devices as well, with also a faster processor.Still a decent product for just $40, but I'd choose the Chromecast over it any day."
"1892","Worked great with little effort to set up - as long as you know your WiFi access and application logins for things like Amazon and Netflix. Remote is simple (especially for those with Android phones/tablets) and ""RF"" so you do not have to worry about line of site.  The only reasons I have not given this 5 stars are 1) it froze the screen once (required me to power cycle it) and 2) some of the list controls take some getting used to (for example, if you reach the left side of line of titles, continuing ""left"" does not go to the next line)."
"1893","The Amazon Fire TV Stick info didn't tell me in advance that Amazon charges a fee to access many or most TV programs and movies.  Very easy to run up a bill on your credit card by hitting the wrong button accidentally."
"1894","We have the original fire TV stick and decided to pass that one along and upgrade. I was excited about being able to use the voice control with the remote and while I do periodically I don't use it very often. Aside from that there really isn't much difference between this one and the original stick. With the software update the interface looks the same on both and I didn't notice any performance differences. Would highly recommend, and do, to anyone considering it."
"1895","My 52 inch TV is pre-smart TVs but works perfectly.  The Fire TV Stick was the perfect solution to access Amazon Prime, Netflix and the rest.  Works perfectly and the voice remote is exceptional.  Great value for a tiny price."
"1896","The Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice remote was very easy to set up!  We plugged it in to the USB port in the back of the TV and were walked through instructions on the TV!  So EASY!!  I was afraid it was going to be complicated and that I would need my son to help me and I did it all by myself!  Also, you don't need anything else like to download an app!!  You just use the remote (or your VOICE!) to scroll through Amazon's video choices.  I was beyond surprised and pleased with how easy it was!  Finally!  You don't need your child to help you set up technology!  THANK YOU AMAZON!"
"1897","I wanted to be able to use a tv in my basement while exercising. The firestick was perfect for allowing me to view my prime movies and those I had purchased for my video library without the additional cost of adding cable."
"1898","Awesome product.  Works as advertised.  Great way to use the Prime account and other on-demand services.  I purchased two for the guest bedrooms as an alternative to paying extra monthly fees for additional cable boxes.  Guests are able to enjoy video on demand - better than cable - from Prime and Netflicks, and they would need to stream quite a few additional pay movies to equal the extra cable box charges. The voice command options are very cool.  Overall just a great, well designed device. Couldn't be happier with my purchase."
"1899","Excellent product, I have 3 of them, I think a little improvement should be done on the layout of apps. It's a little slower in changing Channels compared to the Apple TV , but then again it's just a stick. I enjoy using it, high quality resolutions for movies and best of all allows me to save money from cable bills. Now I only pay $10 a month for 60 channels including HBO through Directv Now as compared to my previous bill of $140 a month. Also I can use the remove to ask Alexa to control my lights, thermostat and lock my doorsz"
"1900","Guess this technology is a bit more than we can understand. Some people think it is best thing since sliced bread. We computer challenged are a not able to comprehend. Perhaps we will catch on eventually."
"1901","I have a house full of these and a fire tv. Thanks Anazon, with Direct TV Now, HBO Go, prime and Netflix, I'm not missing paying a cable company I hate. I love that it comes loaded with my amazon profile."
"1902","The remote quit working the first day would not respond even tried new batteries to replace the batteries that came with the remote sorry Amazon this one didn't meet your usually high standards it happens."
"1903","I love my firestick!! What a great purchase. It was easy to setup and use and the Alexa feature is superb.I will never look at cable the same way again. I plan on purchasing another one for a second bedroom."
"1904","Amazing product me and my husband love it it's 10in1 I don't need xbox no more or cable..well it need internet but if you can get what you want to watch it's in these  product all I can say is ""WoW"""
"1905","I had trouble with the voice-activated function.  It worked as expected on the second try after I attached the short USB extension cord.  The bedroom TV is in an armoire which is not recommended.  The small extension evidently was adequate to compensate.  Overall, I'm impressed."
"1906","The Amazon fire stick is very excellent. Personally I don't use the voice control I like to do it the old fashioned way.The next item will be the keyboard for my smartphone to control the way I look up movie's."
"1907","Love my fire stick.  It is the 2nd one I ordered because i lost the remote to the first.  After receiving the second one, I discovered I could have downloaded the fire stick app and used it as a remote.  Duh!"
"1908","Easy to set up and easy to use.  It works great with my Samsung t.v. and my 50mps internet connection.  I have not experienced any lagging or streaming issues.  The voice controlled remote is a nice bonus"
"1909","An excellent alternative to cable. Easy enough for my kids to use, simple set up and the Alexa remote is a bonus--she answers questions and pulls up any apps I can't find. I highly recommend this product!"
"1910","It is easy to use once it is set up...easier than using a DVR player for movies...I can go from watching a movie from Amazon right back to watching DirecTv with one click..no settings to change. I'm happy I got this."
"1911","When I first got it, it worked fine for a couple of weeks. Now, I have never exp so much lag with a device than with this one. It is constantly lagging and freezing no matter what app I'm using. I have a Roku 2 coming from Sling TV and I'm hoping that's much better. I'm mad I didn't wait for thr black Friday sale to get this for $10 cheaper. This thing is a headache."
"1912","The Fire Stick with Alexa voice remote rocks!  Not only am I catching up on old shows and now also watching new shows, but I can be super lazy straight from the couch and merely tell Alexa which programs to play.  It's amazing & fun!"
"1913","2nd generation much better than 1st generation, although still has some lag. Very good user interface with program guide. Best way to stream audio and video over network from SMB host by means of VLC app. VLC Fire does not currently appear in Appstore, but VLC for Android (ARMv7) can be sideloaded and is more current. Better than Roku Stick overall. Highly recommended."
"1914","I have had trouble with sometimes the sound stopping until I shut off the tv and re-open. Haven't figured this out yet but haven't spent a lot of time on it either. Love the ease of use and all the available features."
"1915","Once we figured out how to use it, we loved it. So many apps are already preloaded. We watch YouTube and lots of movies. It was easy to install it just needed a few hours to settled. Now we have no buffer issues. It has been the perfect birthday gift for my husband."
"1916","i don't know why i didn't do this sooner... its amazing.. i was so scared to cut of cable in fear of the fire stick not  working all that well - but it has exceeded my expectations. i only wish i had access to local news, but goodbye cable.... hello fire stick.. thank you"
"1917","I purchased Fire TV Stick to change my older LCD TV into smart TV and the Stick filled that purpose perfectly. Also Alexa Voice is a big add on to the package. If you want to know what weather is right now, ask her. This is only example. Great product, highly recommended."
"1918","It works pretty good. The remote doesn't have to be pointed directly at the device and the device is really small. I really like the fact that indent have to purchase a set top box or something similar uhn size to have streaming options. Although the apps are not complete, it's definitely more than I expected."
"1919","I've had it for over a year and just updated the Kodi app.  Watch just about any TV show anytime and access to more movies than you'll have time to watch.  I bought as a Black Friday in July sale and love it."
"1920","I bought this device via Prime Now to use in the hospital. I've been in the hospital for about two weeks and was getting tired of using my iPad for Netflix and other web videos. The hospital wifi uses a login page, so my Chromecast only works via my phone/tablet mobile hotspot. Upon researching I found that the Amazon Fire TV and Fire Stick have the ability to accept a wifi login page, so I bit the bullet. Two hours later and I'm streaming Netflix on the hospital TV!  This device works great, and will definitely be a new addition to my travel / hospital go. Ag from here on out."
"1921","Finally have my stick working, but have to restart it almost every time I go to CBS all access. and have had to restart it a couple of times just to have it come up. Is there a way I can get the Fire TV instead and return this? Just not happy with this performance."
"1922","I was so excited to try the new Fire Stick with Alexa.  I'm so burned out on cable TV and it's awesome to now watch my Netflix plus other channels and apps.  Only problem is Alexa suddenly stopped working and I haven't found a fix for it.  All the videos on you tube or fixes on the internet seem to pertain to Echo or Fire TV, neither of which are what I have.  The remote itself still works, I just cant use voice commands.  I added the app to my iPhone and so far Alexa works with it but it's kind of a hastle to me.  That's what I ordered the remote for."
"1923","Can't give it 5 stars because it is more sluggish in response than the Fire TV box.  Works good and has been a great addition to our cord cutting.  Just seems a little slower or have sluggish tendencies when using it and it's within 10 feet of our WiFi router."
"1924","Works well, great little streaming device for the price. Big plus: supports DirecTV Now.  Cons: needs power, and has a large wall wort that doesn’t play well with power strips.  Wish list: an app like iOS TV Provider to auto sign into apps supported."
"1925","Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote is okay. It never stay shut off or in ""sleep"" mode and gets rather hot physically which could affect performance and possibly cause damage to the unit itself."
"1926","We were late to this technology. I love this little device. It adds to our entertainment options. Love that amazon already sets up the prime membership so you can watch the shows. I am glad I purchased this device."
"1927","This is the 3rd firestick I have purchased and all have worked great.  With an amazon prime account it works perfectly.  You are also to add other applications with little effort.  Love the voice remote."
"1928","How did we ever survive without Amazon Fire TV? We love this! We got the box for our main livingroom, and the Fire Stick for my masterbedroom and my three teens' rooms. We will never go back to cable tv!"
"1929","The batteries were useless. I expected them to last more than two or three days. I replaced with new batteries last night and the frozen screen, which disabled my electronic system, is gone. Alexa still doesn’t work. I’m debating what to do. When it works, it is great. When it doesn’t, well that’s another story. It was very highly recommended to me by the electronics store and my internet installer. I had purchased another product and return it for the stick due to these recommendations. I’m going to give it a chance for a few days."
"1930","Love, love, love it! Cancelled our DirectTV. In one and a half months time the Prime membership and the Fire TV stick will be paid for. We chose Sling TV for a third of what we were paying. Love the HD, picture is so clear. We also like that we can access other shows like Salvage Hunters from UK and Barn Finds that you don't find anywhere else. So far no complaints."
"1931","This Fire TV Stick is an addition to the one purchased a year ago. I ""may"" just place these on a few other TV's in and around the house, since we can stream ton's of movies and other events. this was a great purchase..."
"1932","Can't find a single complaint for the money I paid. It is obviously not the fastest device but for a portable stick that I can take anywhere it is great! Wireless range is fantastic, setup is very simple"
"1933","I always thought the crummy streaming was my ISP, after I got this I realized it was the crappy device I was using. The firestick works awesome. If you are a prime member this should be required equipment."
"1934","I purchased both the Roku and Amazon Fire TV Stick recently and I prefer the Fire TV stick.  The Fire TV stick includes a HDMI extender with the fire stick, the Roku does not.  If there is a small amount of clearance between the back of the TV where most HDMI ports are located this would be an important factor and cost savings for the Fire TV stick since the Roku does not include the adapter.  The Alexa remote is nice, but will take some practice to learn what it can do by voice command.  The programming for the Roku and Amazon TV stick seems similar.  Both are easy to install."
"1935","I always use the chromecast before I had the fire stick, and while I understand the purpose I never felt I needed one. My husband had ordered the fire stick so that he could watch his sports better, and I came to find that I love this thing! I can delete so many apps off of my phone that I don't have to stream. Also the quality is much better as opposed to casting, far more HD. Easier to play any of my daughters many shows without switching apps. Overall would recommend to a friend. Ease of use gets a 9 and I like how it connects to my amazon account."
"1936","Love the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, it is one of the best streamer out there on the market today. I am so happy that I purchased it, now this a new and easy way to watch movies and TV. Thank you Amazon."
"1937","I have 3 of the previous model on tvs around the house and they all worked perfectly. So, we bought the new model when we purchased a new tv for my office. Unfortunately, I regularly have problems with the remote working. This is extremely annoying when you start rewinding or fast forwarding and then press the button to stop, but it just keeps going. I mash the button 20 more times out of frustration and nothing. Then, 20 seconds later it responds to the 20+ button pushes I've done. This is a common issue with other users, so buyer beware until they get this straightened out."
"1938","Fire stick was amazingly easy to set up. The Alexa remote works well. The only thing I would like to see is some organization to Amazon Video, no ability to search by category. I have Amazon Prime yet had a hard time coming up with a single movie that I didn't have to pay additional for. Also kids were trying to search for cartoons and they even had additional fees. So I have to ask if most of Amazon video requires you to purchase how is that a benefit included in Prime? Overall I think the Fire Stick is a nice, easy to use product, though Amazon Video needs some improvement."
"1939","We love the fire stick! So many options. Great investment"
"1940","loved it so much I bought a second one for my husbands TV"
"1941","If you're on the fence about getting a Firestick, like I have been for the past year, just do it. It is seriously the coolest thing I've ever had for tv, movie, etc streaming. REALLY happy I decided to get it."
"1942","I have purchased 3 FireSticks.  One had difficulty keeping a wireless internet connection (which I returned), but the other two have worked very well since unboxing.Setup is straightforward.Adding apps is easy.Streaming apps function well.If you have a non-Smart TV or want ability to install android apps on your media device, this works great."
"1943","I am now the Proud owner of 3 fire stick and one box and I love it. There is enough free app's to keep anyone, two or three + people entertained! I can set my 94 year old Mom up on throw backs, My grand sons on educational offerings and my son on sports when he comes to get them. I love News and comedy so everyone's happy at my house. I have two more sets to go then I will hold a cord cutting ceremony and I might invite you!Thanks Amazon, saving money with more entertainment, I get to choose."
"1944","I fought with my Roku for a week and decided I needed to move up to a better system.  This system really works and streams beautifully.  If an 83 year old woman can set up a Fire TV Stick, you can, too!"
"1945","The fire stick with Alexa voice has helped me to access more quality tv with minimum effort the fire stick arrived on time and it was a brand new item so no problem with that I would Recommand this item"
"1946","You just plug it in and get so many more TV options to watch. Amazon movies and TV shows, also Youtube. There are icons for Hulu and Netflix and it is easy to connect but, you have to subscribe to them."
"1947","This is my fourth Firestick I still need one more. These work so much better than streaming from my smart TV's. Browsing and streaming is very fast there is a definite difference when I use my smart tv."
"1948","While I've been using a Fire Stick for a while, this new one has voice remote which is pretty darn cool.  The stick was easy to set up and works like a charm.  The most difficult part was getting the back off the remote to install the batteries.  :)"
"1949","Some freezing, What can you expect with a streaming device? The rewind feature doesnt work as well as id like on mine but im not sure if thats my problem or the device.otherwise i love this thing! im not sure amazon has made product that  didnt like"
"1950","I already have a smart tv but this fire stick makes it even more enjoyable! I even joined amazon prime to reap the full benefits of it and let me tell you there are some amazing shows/movies on there. The price is great and makes it worth a shot . The way it was packaged was also superb and attractive, it also came with instruction pamphlets. Have had it for about 4 days now and I am excited to see what else I can do with it!"
"1951","I like it very much. I have 3 Roku devices and they can't compact but Roku has ear plugs to watch tv while no disturbing others while they sleep and Amazon fire tv stick doesn't have this item. That would be a plus"
"1952","I haven't had time to use my new Fire TV Stick yet but the few times that I have, I love it. Very easy to set up. The extra attachment that they include so that you can be sure to be able to connect it to you TV was extremely helpful so thank you so much for including it with the package. Can't wait to use it more during the coming months."
"1953","Installed and upgraded the Fire Stick and still couldn't get Thursday Night Football. I followed instructions and all I got was an"" error message try again in a few minutes"". Other than that the stick performed as expected."
"1954","Never thought I'd leave Dish.  However, and I mean this with the enthusiasm that this printed commentary can not justify - (the single one time payment for) this device allows myriad of options in wireless connectivity (- i.e. HULU, PlaystationVU, and Sling just to name a few) to every show and network that I wanted ( - e.g. The Blaze, Fox News, Fox Business, AMC, History Channel, Law & Order, Walking Dead, Amazon Prime FREE movies, ad nausea)  for far less than my monthly bill to Dish or DirectTV.  And of course, NO tiling or temporary outage of service due to weather, etc."
"1955","Still exploring all it can do but really happy with it thus far!"
"1956","It's a fire stick! The best invention EVER! Yes... I said the best invention ever. We now have a fire stick in every room of our house besides the bathroom and kitchen. We watch Netflix, hulu, PlayStation vue, Amazon prime of course, and much more!!!! Best investment!!!"
"1957","I live in Colombia and unfortunately the fire tv stick doesn't work here properly. But still is a good buy."
"1958","I was going to purchase the dish satellite for $1300 to mount on my RV but i just heard about the fire stick. Purchased it and increased my Wi-Fi service to unlimited only after th3 vidéo stream from netflix was eatinh up my gigs. I am able to drive my RV with the kids watching TV."
"1959","Very nice package once you get it set up.  All these devices listening to everything are a little 1984 for me, but itcertainly works nicely and uncovers a lot of the Prime offerings with little effort."
"1960","I got this for a elderly family member who wanted to watch prime videos but the kindle screen was too small..its great and got one for me.  You can watch all our prime videos youtube and shows.  The only thing I would have liked was then ability to use Closed captions..sometimes I like to have the tv on but without the volume.  Just bw aware if your tv doesnt have an extra HDMI port you have to unplug your cable cord every time you want to plugin the fire stick."
"1961","This voice remote works great.  The voice works much better that the first one that I had.  This order was  to replace the first one I had bought earlier this year..  I am very satisfied and love fire TV."
"1962","Took about 10 minutes to set up and is perfect if you don't want to pay a rental fee for a cable box. Where do Abel company's get off for charging you for that crap. Fire stick really sticks it to them. Also Alexa works perfectly on it."
"1963","Very satisfied with the purchase and at a reasonable price. Verbal commands to the Alexa remote is a great feature that helps eliminate having to search for the program.  It does it for you.  Also, casting or mirroring a video from tablet to TV is easy and there's virtually no freezing unlike an older Smart TV that doesn't seem to have a strong enough connection signal.  At this price it's a good test to see options for streaming and reducing cable now or in the future.  This is a worthwhile investment."
"1964","So I don't ever really leave reviews but I have to for this! The firestick is very easy to use and maneuver. It is so great with all my favorite streaming sites. My husband and I don't have regular cable but use this as an alternative and it is perfect."
"1965","I'm so glad we invested in the Fire Stick! I will be buying 3 more for the other TV's in my home. I'd rather pay the one time fee of $40 and just have WiFi than to have a $200 cable or dish bill. The Fire Stick will eventually put cable, dish, Redbox, and movie theaters out of business. You can't go wrong with this purchase. It has already paid for itself since we're watching movies that are out in theaters."
"1966","The first time I've ever had true HD content on my TV.  The picture quality is fantastic and it hasn't bugged out or dropped quality since I've had it.  The only slightly awkward thing is how the USB power source connects to the USB dongle, but they added a small extension cord to tuck it away if you wish.  The search options are a little awkward as well, but this is made up for with the voice remote function that allows you to easily search for what you need.  ALSO, it works with other apps as well.  Use this for Netflix all day long if you want!  My only regret it not purchasing it years ago."
"1967","All around good media steamer. Alexa works well but not flawless. 1080p looks great, processes and streams well. Any complaints are strictly in implementation of Bluetooth accessory connection/support or lack of; browsing capabilites are locked to what amazon ""wants"" you to see,  so I really can't search for what I want.More app developer freedom and support similar to Google Play, or even collaborate. Enhance and increase Bluetooth peripheral selection/support and standardize with android compatibility and this will be the absolute best media box/ device out."
"1968","I have tried many streaming devices throughout the years and by far this one is the best one yet.  I have tested out the Roku, Vizio, and other one and this one is the best one to use.  The ease of use of this device is simple yet it can do most things I want it to.  The only flaw I see so far about using Alexa is that it is not connected to support every application that people use on here.  It would be great if I could use Alexa for Talk to Text as typing the letters for search queries can be tedious.  But to put that aside I still give this 5 stars as it works perfectly."
"1969","Had the old one and enjoyed most of time, this one is much more difficult to start and find what I want, then many times it just stops and i have a blank screen.  Didn't have this problem with my original, which could not be used with Alexa-have not tried used voice commands."
"1970","It would be better, but the Tune-in radio app doesn't work very well.  When I put it on KGO radio in SF or KSFO it will always default to KCBS every time.  This doesn't happen on my ROKU so I believe it the App made only for the fire stick."
"1971","I have roku, chromecast and now firestick. Firestick is by far the best. It is easy to use and all most of my apps work. I would like to have LMN, which is one of my favorite channels. But overall, it makes up in other areas."
"1972","I love the Fire TV Stick, although the Alexa Voice Remote seems superfluous.  It works well with all the apps I use (save for of course Play Movies and TV).  Pluto is pretty darn nice and the cord is getting cut."
"1973","Great for travelers - very easy to use when spending time in hotels - allows easy access to a universe of television program and movie choices - you won't be stuck with the limited hotel TV selections any more."
"1974","Love the Fire TV Fire Stick!!  Quick connection to Wi-Fi and instant access to every movie, music, etc that you could possibly want to view or listen to.  Love the ability to move the Fire TV stick to any tv in the house.  This is a great purchase."
"1975","I have three Fire TV sticks and recommend the Fire stick to everyone. The Fire stick works well and with Prime offers so many more viewing options compared to the competition. The voice remote is a cool option but I prefer the iphone app if I plan to do any typing."
"1976","Super easy to use and just from googling step by step instructions, I was able to download Kodi and Exodus onto it! Pretty impressed with this thing and may eventually order another for a different tv."
"1977","As an owner of the previous gen Fire TV stick without the voice remote, this isn't a big upgrade.the software is still awkward and slow. During signup my stick decided it did not want to go past the ""Get Prime"" ad. I called support and they told me it was a known issue and I had to wait until they pushed a bug fix to use my device. That was annoying to say the least.The stick seems slightly faster and the remote seems a little nicer. Othwerwise for my personal useage (PS Vue and Netflix) I could have stayed on the previous iteration of the device."
"1978","Thank You, Thank You,  My wife lost her eyesight due to a stroke in feb.She loves music and movies.Firestick has made her life much easier. I love making my wife happy, I am very grateful to you."
"1979","I am very pleased so far with this technology.  But I find I don't know enough yet to take full advantage of its capabilities.  Good thing I have some younger relatives and friends available to help..."
"1980","Wish I had purchased one of these babies sooner. It has opened up a whole world of TV viewing. Oh sure, I get over the air stations but this is a great way to use the over-priced internet provider for something other that the web."
"1981","I own three of these. This review is for the last one that I bought on sale and was delivered on DEC 2.About two weeks after receiving my latest firestick I woke up to find out that it force updated. Besides the fact that the new UI sucks, this stick now only works on one of my three TVs. No way to downgrade means that this one is going back. I called for an exchange but was told that it would be two weeks for delivery. So much for Prime! Now I'll just return for refund.Here's hoping my other two don't update and fail to work or I'll be returning them too!"
"1982","faster better and cheaper than the old one or the Roku.  Runs the Tablo way better than the Roku too.  Voice control works great too."
"1983","I got the Fire stick so that I could watch the Grand Tour Show (love those guys), I'm kind of disappointed that they only have 1 seasson so far(hasn't the show been in the air for over a year?).With that being said, I can't wait for the 2nd season to begin."
"1984","What a great little streaming stick.  It hooked up to my 5g wifi easily and has terrific speed while streaming Plex and Kodi.  I also use it occasionally for music via Spotify.  The interface is smooth and transitions quickly although the Firetv handles Kodi a bit better.As a pleasant surprise you can have a bit of fun playing games like a console.  Simply turn your remote sideways and off you go.  Of course you could also buy a dedicated game controller or in my case, use a PS4 controller."
"1985","Bought two - one singular and one with Alexa bundle.  The one with Alexa bundle continually disengages.  Changed TV's to see if same result.  Appears to be remote so this one will go back for exchange."
"1986","We really enjoy our Fire Stick. We are in the process of doing away with our high Direct TV bill. We watch PS Vue, and many other viewing apps on the Fire Stick. It's pretty seamless, and works very well."
"1987","I have no complaints!  Great replacement for cable boxes"
"1988","Awesome product that has expanded our viewing options and pleasure. Once installed, it's terrific. Our only issue was the limited instructions. Even though it's simple, a little more help could be useful"
"1989","I can say this was very simple to set up, and works like a charm.  I was able to download several stations easily, and we are considering getting rid of our expensive cable service.  This thing is magic."
"1990","I'm not a tech savvy person so I was nervous about ordering this because of some of the reviews but I couldn't afford a ""smart"" tv so I gave this a try. It was amazing. I already had a prime account and Netflix on my computer. After reading the simple instructions I can watch Netflix on my tv and so much more. Had NO PROBLEMS with setup or operation. Very pleased."
"1991","LOOOOOVEEEE ITTTTTT! What else can you say when you no longer need cable...hahhaaha! WIN!!!"
"1992","I thought giving up cable tv would be somewhat difficult, but I was proven wrong when the Fire TV stick arrived.  I was able to install it easily and have been finding new things to watch ever since.  The Alexa voice remote has made listening to favorite musicians simple.  The grands are even impressed with it and look forward to telling Alexa what to play when they visit.  I am thrilled with this purchase."
"1993","The Amazon firestick just keeps getting better. We are so happy with the layout and how easy it is to use. Who needs...what did they call that cable TV that cost so much for years?? Get this and be happy your wallet will be happy."
"1994","My husband and I love our fire stick so much we ordered another one. They are awesome and we have told all our friends about them. We even cancelled our TV service because the fire stick did everything we needed."
"1995","I got this for my DirecTV Now subscription. I really wish I had gotten it sooner. Navigating my Prime Video, Netflix, and Hulu has never been easier. Plus there are lots of apps to add for other things."
"1996","Easy installation and a breeze to maneuver. If there's a downside, it's that everything seemingly cost more money. I strongly recommend being a prime member. Without it, this wouldn't be much of a deal."
"1997","I love the fire stick. It works well and is quick and responsive. I don't like the fact that I can't get it without the voice remote. I don't want the voice remote, I don't need the voice remote, and I feel that the option to get the fire stick without the voice remote should be available."
"1998","Overall nice small profile and works. Though I feel that it's a bit slow when you use Alexa to open applications. Haven't explored much else yet. Coming from a roku that has a nice home screen layout, I find the firestick's layout (same as amazon prime layout) to be disorganized and not so easy to maneuver. But other than those things, works well and good quality"
"1999","The Fire Stick works much better than the way we were streaming through our Wii, but using it is not quite as intuitive as I expected. I am glad we bought it and I'm sure I'll get better at using it with more experience."
"2000","It's awesome. My only problem with it is that it has to be plugged into the wall. I am almost certain this little thing could be powered by the HDMI port. If they made that possible, this would be a perfect little product."
"2001","After becoming totally upset and disrespected by Directv I've subscribed to both cable and satellite services over the years and once they had me as a customer, they all treated me like a second class citizen. The time had come to cut the cord. The Fire TV Stick was the alternative I was looking for. I do find navigating the channels on the internet TV service I've subscribed to a little tedious and there is that annoying buffering from time to time (more than likely due to my ISP) but other than that I am completely satisfied. Free, Free at last!"
"2002","They watch a lot of apps via their Wii U pad. But this allows me to move it from room to room when they don't want to watch the same shows in one room. I also have a box but this is obviously easier to change rooms!!"
"2003","This is our replacement for Direct TV.  We are enjoying the Firestick but we are still learning how to use it. Someone told us we can create favorite/Playlist for the weekly series we watch. Such as Empire, Star Trek, Good Doctor and all the NCIS series.Other than the learning gcurve we are encountering it and think is GREAT."
"2004","I would give it 5 stars but it doesn't mirror your Android phone exactly. You have to use some sort of app to mirror your contents of your phone and Facebook only plays videos. But I guess for the money it'll do"
"2005","I have Roku and just recently purchased the Fire Stick. With those two items, you really do not need cable.  I still have the cable but there are ways to access local channels for news.  For some reason, I cannot get Fox on my office but can at home.  I suspect it has something to do with the internet speed.  In any event, the Fire Stick is a great item.  I suspect the cable providers are going to get hurt financially due to the introduction of the Fire Stick."
"2006","I have been toying with this purchase for a while; holiday discounts and the inability to get Netflix to work on my bedroom TV cable system nudged me over the edge. But boy, I'm sure glad I bought this! This was incredibly easy to set up, the stick was already connected to my Amazon account, so all of my music, all of my movies and all of my preferences were available to me as soon as I had it up and running. I think my most favorite, though least obvious, function is the access to my music and my playlists on Prime. Best purchase yet this holiday season, as far as I'm concerned!"
"2007","Very easy to set up.  Great quality pictures using it.  Compact, doesn't require lots of room.  Too bad it doesn't include a user manual and you have to download on to understand all the features etc."
"2008","Love it so far! Definitely different than the roku or other interfaces I was used to but works great. Only thing I don't like is that I can't use the USB on the back of my TV and have to plug it in separately."
"2009","For the price and features amazing product. It's easy to get Kodi on it and open up your world. I used this to turn a cheap flat HDTV into a picture frame as current picture frames are more than this."
"2010","I love the Amazon Fire Stick. I have several and they work great. I like that I can access all my favorite streaming services all from one page. I also purchased several other units for family members."
"2011","It's okay. It's nice if you don't already have a ps4 or Xbox to stream videos from, but the Alexa voice part isn't all cracked up to be. If Alexa was to work in tangent with apps like Netflix so that you didn't have to type and instead just say what you want to write, then it would be way better. Instead Alexa leaves the app you're in and just gives you suggestions of everything else instead of staying in the app that you wanted to watch the movie or show in. Also doesn't work with Directv Now at all to switch channels.But it is way smoother than the Roku devices."
"2012","I wish I would not have waited so long to purchase the Amazon Fire Stick.  We are dropping our cable TV and phone and will save us over $100 a month! Yes I use more internet but there is still more than enough for a months usage. Buy it!"
"2013","It works well but takes a lot of time understanding how to navigate and can't always find what we want to watch. Buffering is a problem with our internet carrier which is not a fault of Fire TV stick but a frustration in it's usage."
"2014","I bought the device based on several factors. I use it to access PS Vue and Tablo. I have an older Fire Stick and I have a Roku 3. I like the menus on Fire Stick which is why I bought this. I don't like that the interface is slow to react. Often it takes several presses to get a response which is annoying."
"2015","I like the Firestick but the remote isn't very sturdy and is already broken in 6 months. I've had other remotes for like 10 years and my dog has abused the others. They are still working. Sort of frustrating since there is no other way to turn it on or watch it."
"2016","Works really well, easy to set up with a slick interface and it's great to have one device for most most music and video services. The voice control is nice but it would be awesome if it integrated with apps as well, at least major ones like Hulu and NetflixI can't wait until I can use something like this to get my TV channels and kick Comcast to the curb."
"2017","Amazing for a little stick!!! I could finally watch Netflix on a the TV instead of my PC!!! Playing loud music over the YouTube app and i found out what kodi is and its amazingUpdate:  I been having a lot of problems with the stick from remote lagging too the WiFi disconnecting. I connected my phone with the aapp it helps and its more better , but it disconnects when the WiFi will go out. I will recommend to buy the fire TV (not the stick) or paying more for a better streaming box. I will try out the Nvidia shield since i heard it works flawless with kodi ."
"2018","Love my firestick! Love the voice activation. Tons of great movies on Amazon. It's easy to use Netflix and Hulu on this unit period due to it I am no longer reliant on the high prices the satellite TV"
"2019","We have both the firestick and the regular firetv.  While the fireTV has a faster processor, so response time is better, this firestick still works great.  I never need anything else.  I also travel with it."
"2020","This is fantastic.  I wish I would have purchased one a long time ago.  I bought it to use in my craft room so I could watch tv sine I don't have the tv hooked up to satellite.  Best thing I ever did."
"2021","Love it ! All in one entertainment ! If you have a Netflix or Hulu account and know about using kodi than this is a must have!! Easy to setup with an easy to use interface. Love the Alexa feature as well!"
"2022","love it, i can't believe we waited this long to buy it."
"2023","Just arrived to replace horrible Roku Stick which was hard to set up and didn't connect very well. This Amazon Fire Stick was connected and running in about 5 minutes. Already had my Amazon Prime account set up and ready to go. Just had to download Netflix app (many others are available). Fun and useful voice remote works well too for finding titles. Excellent product. I don't even know why Amazon sells the inferior Roku stick. Even comes with a little extender cord if you TV needs it to fit in HDMI jack (I did). If you need that from Roku, you have to call them to send you one. Buy this."
"2024","Love the firestick.  I like have all my entertainment right at my fingertips with out having to to change apps.  I can't tell Alexa to find a movie and she does.  Grey sizeForTraveling too."
"2025","I love my Firestick, it's so easy to install and navigate. It's perfect when you have Amazon prime. I like that there's an app you can install on your phone in case your actual Firestick is out of reach. You can install apps on your smart TV."
"2026","still not sure how this works.  seems like it is complicated to connect and disconnect from my tv.  No directions for use were included with this product.  Guess I will just learn through trial & error."
"2027","It worked according to my expectations. For me, I had to read the instructions and follow them and was able to utilize the device as intended. I would recommend it to anyone it works beautifully on my TV"
"2028","Works well need to play with it to get the full effect"
"2029","Item as described and fast shipping. Very good quality"
"2030","I love this product. It works great on my TV.  No problems at all and easy to setup. I mostly watch Amazon Prime shows and Netflix.  I keep questioning why I continue to pay for a full Cable package."
"2031","THE GOOD1. Amazing, It is easy to set up and use.2. The picture resolution is amazing, really, really good and no buffering.3. The remote is very comfortable and very easy to use. You don't have to wave it about to get it to work.THE POOR1. The menu takes a little getting used to.2. The apps that come with it are not as easy to launch and use as the Apple TV and there are not as many apps available that are ready to use. Most of them require subscriptions which is time consuming and clunky.3. The user interface is a little clumsy to use."
"2032","I really like my fire stick.  I was sick of watching hulu, netflix and all my amazon stuff on my computer, but didnt feel like shelling out the money for a smart tv. I bought the firestick and it solved all of these problems!!!! it works really well and I havent had any issues.  It's super easy to figure out and was super easy to set up.  I really recommend it."
"2033","Worked great for 4 months.  Loved the features, speed and ease of use. However, today my screen is black and will not respond to remote even after changing out batteries.  All amazon help and support ideas and comments on there site recommend solutions.  None of them work and I am not stuck with a 40.00 black brick that does not work.  You would think as long as this product has been out in the market issues such as a frozen black screen would not be an issue.  Will not be buying more amazon devices until they learn to work the bugs out of them."
"2034","We had the original Fire Stick which had some design flaws resulting in the connection between power and the fire stick failing due to too much weight being put on the cord.  This new Fire TV Stick with Alexa is much improved!  It's sturdier the problem with the port on the stick and weight on the wire is almost nonexistent.  The Alexa feature is great and a real time saver."
"2035","Love it, worth every penny. Turned around and bought in for my parents the next day I installed mine."
"2036","Actually 3.5 stars due to the silly power supply error that has taken up to 1.5 hours to resolve; on more than one occasion-annoying. But when working, it works great! I own two! Kudos for NFL on Thursday’s."
"2037","I can't believe I don't even notice no cable or network telly. I LOVE my fire TV stick so much I bought a 2nd one for the other TV in our home. I follow news with various subscriptions and more than enough entertainment content with Prime, Netflix, Acorn and BritBox."
"2038","I like the Alexa Voice Remote, but...of all the movies I've asked it to find, very few have been accessible without paying a fee.  Maybe I was expecting too much, but lots of the movies on Prime are box office flops.  I'm sick to death of paying a satellite provider over $100 a month for their garbage but not sure this is the answer, either.  Maybe a mudflap antenna and an acquired addiction to Bonanza is what's in order."
"2039","Great.  Easy to use and fast.  4K is a plus  and Alexa,  maybe,  but I am not quit ready for talking to my TV yet.  I will leave that to the young ones for now.  Like so much I bought one for my daughter."
"2040","love the fire stick there is not one bad thing i can say about it. It made my netflix so much faster than when i was just going through my smart TV. I gave one to most of my family members as presents!"
"2041","This product works pretty good. I got this because my Sony blu ray player would buffer on Netflix streaming. Only Netflix had the problem, Amazon streamed perfectly. We'll the stick solved the problem with Netflix streaming and everything looks GREAT. I would suggest that you do not use the HDMI extension as it made my picture terrible. Be aware that if you have a lot of devices in your house hold connected to the ""wifi"" you will get a terrible picture and buffering. I have 100 Mbps local and 54 Mbps wireless (shared). Over all great product, price, and picture."
"2042","I was streaming live TV and it froze up and did a lot of buffering. That was the Star Trek first episode. So maybe too many people were all trying ai once. It has worked great on other shows and music."
"2043","We are very pleased with this purchase.  Enjoying the programming very much!  I highly recommend purchasing it.  Having Alexa for optional voice searching is a great added feature!  We have a Sony Bravia TV we are using the Fire TV Stick with, but found out that our HDMI 2 port does not work.  Did not want to pay for a service visit or buy a new TV.  We went to a local electronics store and got an adaptor that lets us use the 1 working HDMI port for both FiOS connection and Fire TV Stick, without having to keep unplugging things to switch back and forth.  This was a great solution for us."
"2044","I have Hulu and Netflix already but not a smart TV so I love loveLove my Firestick!! I hate the slippery too small always getting lost remote. But the stick is easy to install and get working!!"
"2045","Firesticks are the greatest invention ever. We ditched cable and now watch Direct TV and Netflix through the firestick! It's so easy to use and the picture is always super clear!  Highly recommended!"
"2046","Bought this and it got placed on backorder. It actually came in 7 days earlier than expected! I had a roku stick before purchasing the Amazon Fire tv stick. Roku compared to the fire tv stick is like comparing a flip phone to a brand new galaxy s7. Amazon fire tv stick is out of this world. I wouldn't be surprised if it made roku go bankrupt. So the first thing I did with the fire stick was download kodi and it works amazing! There are so much more apps you can download unlike the roku stick. You can even mirror screen your smartphone to the fire tv. There is no glitches with the screen mirroring. I signed into my ps vue account and it gave me free  elite ps vue automatically for 3 months! Hands down the Amazon Fire Tv Stick is the best streaming device I have ever had! Amazing job Amazon! Well done"
"2047","I really like this device, and I like being able to put apps on it to run whatever I want.  The only issues I have with it is the very occasional slowdown and disconnecting from the network.  Outside of that, this is perfect."
"2048","Love it but wish we could add user profiles so that my wife can watch and keep track of her own shows etc. Also it's a complicated interface for her to use. It would be ncie to filter out the shows and channels that we don't watch or that cost money."
"2049","Huh! I discovered the Sony TV remote actually works the firestick.  I cannot explain this! Good news though. Is the Sony HDMI sending commands to the firestick? I have searched and cannot find any information about this. Cannot figure how this happens, I 'm looking to understand this. Not crazy - it really does work!UPDATE:It seems that the mechanism is HDMI-CDC.  Just what I suspected."
"2050","Love it, I had the fire TV in my other bedroom, but decided to get this for my smart TV in the living room, which has the amazon application but it does not work as good as with the stick and its much easier to use it with Alexa."
"2051","We bought this to experiment with disconnecting from our satellite tv service.  Our big concern was getting daily news.  We have 4 tv's. The ones in the kitchen and living room are our main ones for news.  So we installed the firestick on our living room tv.  It will be a process.  We are getting more used to watching shows a day or more later but still haven't quite figured out the news (local & national) w/o going back to the satellite.  Any ideas would be appreciated.  I gave the Firestick 5 stars because it does do exactly what it said and was very easy to hook up."
"2052","Will try some more after things quiet down from hurricane but so far disappointed as it keeps buffering. It's supposed to stream with no buffering but not the case. I have comcast and don't have that problem with my blue ray or smart tv."
"2053","OK so I love my new fire stick. I haven't had TV in my bedroom since I had it all shut off and I got this and I didn't think I could hook it up,,, I did it all by myself ,,,yay !! I even got my music playing and everything..... I LOVE IT !"
"2054","So happy with my purchase of Amazon Fire Stick with Alexa. We bought our first Amazon Fire Stick for our family TV and liked it so much that this purchase was for our second TV. I enjoy the Prime movies and series very much! We are canceling our cable movie channels and possibly all cable. We were a little late to Streaming, but are loving it now."
"2055","Excellent product. Have considered for a long time. Happy I finally purchased one!"
"2056","This thing is amazing. I worked for the cable company for eight years and had free cable and now that I started paying for it I thought I would try this and I've only had it for a day but I'm ready to make the switch"
"2057","I have two smart TVs, but I couldn't view my Amazon video on my really big TV. No more!  And with this inexpensive, plug and play device I can see my Amazon content as well as Netflix and my Acorn TV subscription. I love it!  The voice feature is perfect for my husband, who has vision trouble in low light and can't see what buttons to push. No more! He just asks Alexa to play the next episode of Longmire, and it starts right up! The remote is very solid, too. I only had a little trouble removing the back to insert the two included AAA batteries, but quickly figured it out. I am very pleased."
"2058","Love the Fire Stick!  Previously bought a Roku for two video subscriptions that I have. Had to return it because it was hard to set up. The Fire Stick is so easy to set up and use. I highly recommend it."
"2059","I have been unable to get live tv to work even after installing tv media player. I have called Amazon Fire 4 times without any resolve. The first 3 calls were answered by someone located in the Philippines and I got disconnected midway through all 3 calls.  The last call was to a guy who didn't have a clue how to make it work and was watching a YouTube video on the subject and relaying the information to me.  He told me the staff at the service center had not had much training on the device yet...."
"2060","sometimes it doesn't get me the movie i am looking for but that is life in the Cloud  have to accept the streaming system. Sometimes you get a catch sometimes you come up empty. I will keep fishing."
"2061","I am very impressed with the new amazon fire stick it is way better then the old one with only one thing I am not a huge fan of...I love that the remote is bigger I don't loose it like I did the old one. The old amazon fire stick I had a problem with youtube app working at all this one I have had no problems with that. Everything runs a lot faster and when you use Alexa she goes to whatever you said very quickly with little to no lag. The only thing is the lettering is quite small on the screen compared to the old fire stick. However this one beats out the other by far."
"2062","Fire TV Stick works easily and quickly.  In fact, easier to use (especially with voice activation) with our older non-smart TV, than our newer smart TV.  Faster, too.  Definitely worth the purchase!"
"2063","The Fire TV Stick arrived ahead of schedule. I didn't realize that it came with the 8 inch HDMI extender cable so I ordered that also. The remote came with new batteries and the set up was a breeze."
"2064","Bought it as a gift for a friend who recently cut the cable cord. Seems to be a great resource for entertainment. Ability to use Add-ons provides even more options. While I do still have cable, I am tempted to get one for myself just because."
"2065","I love my Fire TV Stick. It's a great way to watch your videos and keep on top of you Amazon activity too. It's very easy to setup and use. I set mine up in a few minutes. I think you'll like it a lot."
"2066","Love the all new Fire tv stick with Alexa voice remote. It was super simple to set up just plug it in and go. I love the parental lock features so your kids can't buy anything. Works great. I love that it will find songs I ask it to play from my Amazon music. It finds my favorite shows on Netflix and Amazon video. It is so easy to use even my kids can do it. This is a great streaming device. I am so glad that I purchased it. We had been looking into them for a while and I am really glad that we went this way. The price was a great value for all that it can do. Great job Amazon!!"
"2067","Easy to set up. Streaming is very good.Only drawback is the picture quality is much darker than that of the WIDI device which was being used prior to this purchase.Trying to find a solution to this, but otherwise very good product and represented pretty accurately.Hope Amazon does not get too commercial in its display of content and also hope there security for other applications is well testedsince you have to store in the cloud.  Just old school I guess, but never wanted to do this in the past."
"2068","Love the fire stick so far! I am glad they included the extender or I wouldn't have been able to connect it to my television. Mine is on the wall and the HDMI ports are on the back of it.The extender fit fine but the stick definitely would not have. Set up was easy and now I have Netflix and my Amazon prime account on it! When we bought the set we didn't realize it wasn't a smart tv until after we had it all set up on the wall and started to use it. Fire stick took care of that! Voice remote is cool even though I haven't used it much. Too used to clicking, I guess! Very pleased so far."
"2069","This thing is great!  It's easy to use and easy to set up.  I never tried an the last generation model, but it seems like the only difference is the alexa voice controller add-on. I've  been recommending the fire stick  to all my friends and family."
"2070","If you are looking for Arab TV channels- you can download the ArabTVLive app though the firestick, and you get all MBC channels Aljazeera, some Lebanon channels- in total about 25 channels. Great alternative to buying an Arab IPTV box which runs about 200$, especially if you are okay with just the major channels."
"2071","This is another one of Amazons victorys. This is the cheaper model of FireTV that isn't as fast and supports only 1080p at max, so I wasn't expecting much. After completing the installation and getting sling and kodi, there was absolutely no lag involved. My only problem is that alexa is not the same version as the echo's version so she can't really play songs on spotify, but I think you can connect the echo to the fire stick.NOTE: I reccomend unplugging the fire stick after use as you will notice it will overheat."
"2072","This is the leader of the pack!  Had Chromecast from day 1 and it was always a bit of a struggle to use, but tolerated it.  When the Fire Stick was delivered, I unpacked it, stuck it in, ran through the set up and it was if I had stepped into the future.  It worked seamless, quickly, with no hassle, not problems.  Ran through my Netflix accounts with more ease and speed that I ever got with Chromecast.  The voice command feature worked the first time I tried it!  The Fire Stick is what the future of streaming video control will look like."
"2073","Love the firestick! Super easy to install and easy menus to navigate."
"2074","Works great, my son is so happy he can watch all the movies and TV shows we bought on his Kindle tablet on the ""big screen"" now. The access to Prime streaming content and other applications is great. I highly recommend this product."
"2075","The fire TV stick is simply amazing. The entire screen scrolls so smoothly and the on screen resolution is simply amazing. I would want to say the clarity, sound and TV display are simply stunning. The visuals on screen with the resolution makes you think that you are watching TV in 4K resolution. It brings out the best HD on your TV. There is also no buffer time because of this Huge memory and speed. It is low cost but packs a lot of punch. With a prime account it's even better. So go for it!!!!!"
"2076","I purchased theAmazon Firestick to use Hulu live tv; unfortunately, the Hulu app cannot be downloaded. Customer support walked me through how to address the odd problem - my account was linked to an overseas version of Amazon that I had several years ago so Hulu could not be downloaded. The firestick team figured out and addressed the issue immediately."
"2077","Awesome product! The remote is great. I have a smart TV but I don't use the smart TV apps. I use the Fire TV stick. It does need a volume control feature though. I also have the Apple Tv 4th Generation. Their remote has a volume control feature but that's the only thing I like the Apple remote."
"2078","Very easy to set up and use! So far have had no issues. I love the Alexa voice remote. Thanks to this, we finally were able to get rid of cable in our house and not feel like were missing anything. Highly recommend."
"2079","This is the best thing since sliced bread...truly.  I am able to watch every channel, every movie with ease.  By non-traditional means and the use of Kodi & Exodus I am tapped into an unlimited, unbound TV/Movie watching experience.  Gone are the days of cable/dish programming and subscriptions to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon.  Everyone needs this in their lives."
"2080","Not as good as Chromecast, especially for interfacing with YouTube and Netflix, but it's the best way to stream Amazon video content. I hate using a remote (another reason to go with Chromecast) but Amazon has designed the nicest remote possible. Also, for those who use Plex, Amazon Fire Stick is not compatible (you'll need Chromecast). All in all, it's okay."
"2081","Love the fire stick. I haven't explored all I can do with it yet, but since hooking it up we hardly watch live TV any more. Love the voice activated remote too. I plan to get one for the other tvs as soon those tvs have been replaced with sets that are compatible to the fire stick.. the other two we have are really old and don't have HDMI connections. When that is done, I'll likely cut our cable down the the most basic package, or get rid of it entirely and subscribe to what we like through prime. Getting the fire stick was best thing I could have done in my opinion."
"2082","Was debating between this and the Fire TV and this was on sale for $39.99 and I bought this. I wanted to use on a TV that was not a Smart TV - did not have the ability to install the Amazon app on (which my main TV in the family room does). Since I am a Prime member, wanted to take advantage of that and have the ability to watch Amazon prime on my other TV. This works great and is so easy to set up. I actually ended up installing another app on it called Kodi which allows me to access a ton of other movies and shows for free, This Is well worth $39.99 or even $49.99."
"2083","This is our second Fire TV stick, since we have enjoyed the first one so much. It is easy to set up and easy to use. Much easier in fact than using the smart TV itself. We bought the second one so it can travel with us so we can watch our favorite shows on the go. We have not used it for that yet, but it travels around the house to various TVs with ease. It is always amazing to me to be able to set up tech quickly and easily, and have it actually work first time. No aggravation. or wasted time. I appreciate that, and it is all too rare. This is a great little device!"
"2084","This stick did everything and more then I thought it did. It's a lot faster then the Amazon fire app on my smart tv. Real easy setup that didn't take long at all. Came in faster than the date specified."
"2085","Love my Amazon Fire tv Stick! I mainly bought this device to add Kodi.tv to it so I can watch free movies and tv using the Exodus add-on. So far I'm very impressed on how easy it was to install the apps needed to run Kodi and with Alexa, it did it with ease without having to type much in using the remote. It's very convenient to be able to watch a movie/tv show in my living room and then remove the device and watch a movie in my bed room without the hassle of cords or running a internet cable. Highly recommend this product for those who love movies and tv using Kodi."
"2086","The Amazon Fire Stick is my new found addiction.  Very easy to plug in ans set up with my hot spot.  The remote is user friendly as well.  The selection screens for choosing what to what are easy to navigate also."
"2087","Nice addition for alone-standing monitors with good quality picture. Used for Netflix and Amazon Prime - may expand to include other streaming apps. The only complaint is typical for Amazon Prime - it does not work outside of the US. Yes, it will pull up the shows as it would in the US, but unless it is an Amazon-specific production, most shows will not work."
"2088","Such a great powerful little product. I have purchase several for the house and use daily. This fire stick has helped cut the cost of cable. The product is really easy to use. Only thing i wish it has it volume and on/off for tv."
"2089","Great addition to our entertainment and tech equipment. being Alexa enabled is the ultimate!  We absolutely love it!Highly recommended for anyone who is tech oriented and entertainment prone."
"2090","This is the best stick out of all of them! It's fast with no hiccups, great picture, and very easy to maneuver. Yes, the Roku is great but the Fire TV Stick has the edge. Try it and you'll love it!"
"2091","We really enjoy this device. You can stream just about anything. Some you do have to pay a monthly charge. But there is a ton on free options also! I recommend to a lot of my friends! Order it now!"
"2092","I used to hate Amazon Prime when I used it on my blu-ray player because it's slow with a terrible interface. Turns out that was the way It was presented on my blu-ray player, which is almost five years old. This little gadget is great and handles just about everything I want to play on the TV, except for Vudu, but oh well."
"2093","So far I love it! I could care less about have the Alexa feature, it's stupid. I have the original fire stick, this newer model is far superior. Just canceled my cable, this should soften the blow."
"2094","Love it!  Prime, Netflix, and Hulu all in one place."
"2095","I love my Fire TV stick. It works so much faster than my smart TV or Xbox. We take it with when traveling. It's great. Sometimes the voice recognition is a little slow but we still like it enough to buy another one for our other TV."
"2096","The wall plug that was included in the package did not work and I ended up having to use another one that I had in my house.  I contacted support and they never responded and have not sent a replacement.  Also, I was under the impression that this worked with the Amazon Echo as well as a voice remote - but this actually has no connectivity to Echo whatsoever and you can only speak to it when holding down the microphone button on the remote.The picture quality is clear and the device works well, but the packaging and customer service has left a lot to be desired."
"2097","Since amazon asked for a review on a birthday gift i have not yet receive, i was told i had to review my gift in. Jul now i xcan quit worrying about what got.  The downstairs works great and easy ."
"2098","This is my third Amazon Fire Stick and the newest version as well, They have proven to be a good addition to my TV viewing options and I would recommend using one and the other two are still in service."
"2099","I have had a number of competitor systems over the years and this one is the best.  Easy to use and great viewing alternatives.  It fit my side mount ports on our 65"" fine with the included HDMI extender.  The external power supply has a very short cord (maybe 3') but easily reached the power-surge strip location for us.  You might have to do some rearranging if your power bar is farther away. Otherwise, excellent."
"2100","Why would you remove the option to calibrate the display? Such a horrible decision. Who ever came up with this idea should be fired. I shouldn't have to adjust my TV every time i switch between cable, fire stick and a gaming console because you decided to not allow people to calibrate the display. You'll get 5* when you fix this horrible change."
"2101","Very easy to install. Very user-friendly with the Alexa remote. I would recommend it for anyone who uses alternate media sources to be able to view movies and television shows. One of the better purchases I have made in quite a few months. Happiness is almost guaranteed!"
"2102","What did I ever do without my Amazon Fire TV Stick. Love the Alexa Voice Remote, too! I can't believe all the programming, shows, movies, and documentaries I have access to with the stick. Love being a Prime member to be able to see a lot of the programming at no charge."
"2103","This was not my first Fire Stick, but sense it was on sale, I figured I would pick up another one. The new Fire Stick is the same in everyday but one, and that one is a problem. The form factor on the new Fire Stick is wider, so it does not make a convent when in an HDMI port. It blocks the ports of another HDMI devices so I lose a port with the Fire Stick in. The Fire Stick comes with a dongle you can install to help with this, but the makes the video quality a bit grainy, as well as any movement to it what so ever blacks out the screen and puts stress on the port."
"2104","I bought this to place on my 8 year old's tv.  She was the only one in the house without cable.  With the increasing cost of my current cable tv - $200+ I've really been considering cancelling cable completely but just haven't been able to cut the cord.  After seeing what channels and other apps are available with this little tool, I'm sold!  It was also very easy to hook up!  It took me longer to figure out how to open the battery compartment on the remote than it took to actually hook up the device and program the tv.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!"
"2105","What a relief: the cable is cut at last. First Time Warner and then Spectrum were found guilty of charging me $232 per month for their basic cable, phone, and Internet bundle (medium speed). Ridiculous. The Kodi Amazon Fire TV stick makes great dollars sense. And Alexa keeps me inspired at my keyboard with my favorite jazz and classical music. Thanks, Alexa."
"2106","i wanted netflix on my tv.  i got what i wanted, but the remote keeps freezing up.  the only remedy is removing. then replacing the batteries. it probably happens three times a night, it's a real pain.  i called amazon fire tech. help twice  they were very pleasant, but no help"
"2107","This is a 5-star device but, I only gave it 4 stars because of the very few content accessible from Mexico, I already knew that but it's still a bummer :("
"2108","It takes some getting used to compared to traditional button remotes but it's small and easy to handle."
"2109","I like it I just don't like when I search for a movie it brings up everything that I can rent or buy too when I just want to search the prime movies and shows that don't cost me money.  The product itself is great I think my grip is with the program itself and how it searches"
"2110","It works just fine, & gives you lots of choices... It's just hard to get hardly anything to stream. (almost) Everything we try to watch says ""no stream available""...or it just keeps buffering throughout the show."
"2111","We love our Fire TV Stick.  It's very easy to setup and easily moved from one tv to another.  The voice control works great.  We enjoy movie, music, games and TV shows all in one place.  It's easy to setup apps like Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and many others to stream content.  For the price, you can't beat the Fire TV Stick."
"2112","This was a birthday gift from my tech savvy daughter.  I'm extremely happy with the device, and the additional capabilities it provides my TV.  I don't use cable TV, and the changes from the tech world move quickly, but I like my fire stick and alexa voice remote!"
"2113","Ya'll this is alright.  The stick gets tired and reboots OFTEN.  We make sure the Fire Stick is turned off when it's not in use.  It's buggy and doesn't work right.  Maybe I'm asking for too much."
"2114","I am so glad to have this user friendly device at a great price for my second tv.  Its so handy when grandchildren arrive and we need some kids programming.Easy to set up and use.  A winner!"
"2115","The hardware is nice but the interface has always been clunky and it seems like every update puts more ads and menus for their Prime Video suggestions between me and getting to what I actually want to watch.The big problem is I've consistently tore through my monthly data usage since I've had this. Googling around shows plenty of results for the different versions being huge data hogs. There's not any options to use a lower resolution or bandwidth so that's no help. The consensus seems to be on bugs with Mosaic Mode for the screensaver (which I never had enabled) and their ASAP feature which automatically downloads extra videos it thinks you may want to watch but there's no way to turn it off unfortunately. If you don't have a monthly data cap then it'd be okay I suppose, but if you do then steer clear."
"2116","Yes I love it works great watch TV show and program movies​ and more I'm glad the I get one so I don't have to used my PlayStation all the time thank you and I recommend it to anyone great product"
"2117","I bought both the fire and the roku stick, both are very well media devices, roku works alot faster than fire on all my tvs, almost no lag, fire stick has some lag some times too much lag, as it make me press the bottons seceral times, now the user friendly of the fire is of my preference i am also a prime member so that is also a plus, i really want the stick to be much more responsive, and for it to have aa individual customization settings for a better expirience, great device. But if you want a ssmother experience buy the fire tv not the stick. I like the faster roku stick better."
"2118","Wasn't sure what I was expecting.  Takes some knowledge in how this works.  But after talking with daughter,  you tube and the help,  I got it figured out.  I won't be watching tv the old way.  It's a new way of watching tv.  I think I'm going to like it. I'm returning my cable box today.You just can't plug in and go.  It takes time.  After 3 weeks,  I've got my show listed and will be ready for the new seasons of shows.  I'm able to finish up this seasons' shows and get to watch shows on premium tv that I wasn't able to watch before."
"2119","This is a great add on for any TV.  This has allowed me to get rid of some cable boxes in my home that Charter charges me $10/month for.  Plus you get all the Prime stuff on your TV, what is not to like about it."
"2120","I like it. Makes finding things easier than any other gadget we've tried.wasn't hard to set up either. We have basic TV so it's nice to find something to watch when there is nothing on regular TV."
"2121","I am not happy with this device. I have this in one room and a Roku in another room. The Roku outperforms the Fire TV Stick by far. On nearly a Daily basis the Fire TV Stick freezes up and I have to remove the power and reset it. When I stream videos on Amazon Prime the sound is ALWAYS out of sync with the video. The only nice feature is the voice activation, but it is not worth the frustration caused by the other issues. If you are trying to decide between this and another streaming device, I would recommend a Roku."
"2122","This is way better than other competitors devices. I own a total of two other competitor devices and the Fire Stick is very well rounded in its capabilities and very intuitive. I have ordered a second one for another room."
"2123","Wanted to see what all the hype was about and decided to order...Love it!! It's like the App on my phone but cooler. Addicted to the free movies on it! The voice control is great to use when you want to be a couch potatoe!"
"2124","This has exceeded my expectations, very simple to set up and use. I bought this to begin the process of ""Cutting the Cord"" from my cable TV provider. This will pay for itself just by eliminating my box rental fees. I was skeptical about how much streaming content was actually out there, but there's a ton, I wish I bought this years ago."
"2125","Love my firestick! I have two. It is the best and easiest way to steam everything including Netflix. My biggest complaint is when I contacted Amazon they said I can't have more then two on my prime account. So I had to purchase a Roku for another TV in our home. I'm still short another way to streamline for a  couple of TVs. We haven't had cable for a long time and we are a large family so I really think Amazon drops the ball here on the 2 stick limit. My Netflix account allows all of our family members to have their own profile and we can all watch our own thing and we are only limited because of way to streamline. Who wants computers and long HDMI cord all over. Will have to buy more Roku sticks I guess. I'm not going to purchase 2 prime memberships a year for my family when we all live in the same home."
"2126","I really like the Fire Stick. My Smart TV does not allow me to download additional applications besides the one that are already on the TV.  So that means I don't get HULU and tons of other Applications.  The only issue that I have with it is that having to plug it in has been kind of a pain. My TV is mounted pretty high too. I thought that it would be able to be powered by the TV but that is not the case.  I would still recommend if it sounds like it would meet your needs."
"2127","I called customer service to help set it up and  my grandson showed me how to use it. It's ok, but I was expecting more movies with popular actors and to be able to watch local channels without having to pay an extra $10 per month per channel even with Amazon Prime. SMH"
"2128","It's ok when it works but it constantly buffers and drops connection to wifi (which is sitting right next to it) making it frustrating to watch shows. It seems to work fine when streaming Amazon music."
"2129","Im very satisfied with it, I just wish there are more free movies to watch. I notice movies that were released  5yrs or 10 yrs ago we still have to pay a rental fee to watch them .i.e $2.99-$4.99, etc."
"2130","It's Quick,easy to use once setup,and not expensive. This review is mostly yo address the numerous 1 star reviews being posted. NOTHING IS FREE! If you are being promised 'FREE TV"" then it's ILLEGAL! The closest you can get is using the KODI app and installing 2nd/3rd party apps on KODI to allow you to watch channels. Most of those will be in the form of the channels internet app that streams the show on demand. The ""FREE LIVE SPORTS"" are technically illegal. Do you REALLY think Amazon is gonna have an illegal app ALREADY INSTALLED on a device they're selling WITH THEIR NAME ON IT???? If you Want KODI, you have to install it YOURSELF and it IS legal as it comes. YOU are resposible for whatever secondary repositories you add to KODI,NOT Amazon! If adding repositories,tvaddons and superrepo are the most recommended of the ""Un-Official"" repositories."
"2131","Love this! I just bought my 2nd one. We travel often and this allows me to use everything offered wherever I am. I use it at home, too, as it allows more content than just accessung Amazon via smart TV."
"2132","I bought one for each of my kids, two of which were away at school.  Not only did they love them, their roommates had them ask where I purchased them and within a week, four additional boys had them!"
"2133","BEST PURCHASE EVER!My daughter who is 14 but going on 30..has been at me for the longest to purchase this.Being suspicious about another electronic item..I refused..This Christmas I decided to surprise her wit one...It was not only a gift for her but now we fight over it. I jus ordered my own.I have deleted all my Internet apps like hulu..Netflix etc. This thing is awesome...I get allllll my shows that I miss PLUS I can watch the latest movies in the theaters AND old movies that I haven't seen in years.One of my best purchases of 2016"
"2134","This is my second Fire TV stick, and I like the new features included. It is very easy to navigate to the various apps, and I LOVE that in-app purchases (such as subscribing to Sling TV via the Fire stick) are charged to the Amazon account. No more quickly running downstairs because that's where your wallet is. As long as you know your Amazon password, you're good to go. One star off because I wish they would find a way to sync the remote with the TV itself - it would be a dream to be able to control the TV's volume from Fire Stick remote. Alexa does a great job!!"
"2135","Third one i buy for yet another TV.  I have truly been impressed with the FireTV stick.  I do have one more TV to go so probably be buying another next time around."
"2136","We have already fallen in love with our fire stick and haven't even had it a week!It is excellent for playing to shows for my toddler - including lots of cool, free learning videos!Fast shipping, easy to set up, easy to use, and great content. What's not to love?"
"2137","One of the best Amazon products out there! I would definitely recommend this if you are a fan of Amazon things and you like using Amazon Alexa. Integrates really well with my iPhone 7."
"2138","This is a wonderful product!  It is compact and works like a charm.  Alexa is an essential helpmate.  Packaging was well thought out, and ecologically sound.  Didn't know what I was missing until I got it."
"2139","I suspended DirecTV because I'm tired of paying for the high prices. I love the Fire TV stick as it downloads movies/tv programs quickly. I'm using this along with Amazon Prime and Netflix. I highly recommend this item."
"2140","Great Tool !!!Highly recommend !!!Does more than I expected!Learning curve for elderly, non-tech type person wasn't so bad.  Helped when younger, more adept person (son) walked us through."
"2141","Works much better in same location as two others I bought last year. Same wifi router etc. Much faster streaming, downloading, more responsive remote control. I don't see any change in specification, but this works much better."
"2142","Several years ago I stopped cable, switching over to Roku. Last year, I bought a Smart Roku TV. I still had several TV's in the house which were unused , so I decided to try the Fire TV stick. I now have 3 TV's using the Fire stick which I love ( including one in the basment). The Fire Sticks were a breeze to install, and paired with Alexa allow me to do multitask with out having to worry about where I laid the remote. Thanks Amazon !"
"2143","Decent interface...but that's it. My Roku blows this thing away. My biggest complaint is the streaming quality. Night and day between running two identical apps...example sling and or Netflix. Don't even get me started on DirecTV now...terrible so far on using fire stick. Probably going to drop it and wait for the app to be available on Roku or my Samsung TV."
"2144","Bought this to replace a Chromecast that I inadvertently left in an Hotel room. The chromecast worked fine and I used it with the Connectify  App on a windows laptop. My Company decided to replace my WIndows Laptop with a Mac. So no Virtual WIFI adapter. I needed something that would now allow me to handle the Hotels Splash Screens. This device does it in spades.  Just downloaded the Slingbox app and along with the ESPN App and netflix it takes care of my Hotel room viewing. I do not really use the Voice control as I find it is not that partial to my Non American accent."
"2145","This did much better for me than I thought it would.  My only gripe is that the advertisement did not state that the stick came with all the needed power attachments--are you reading this Amazon?"
"2146","Love this Amazon fire stick! Gave it four stars because our internet runs a little slow sometimes and it loads off and on for movies. A little annoying but I don't think it has anything to do with the fire stick it is out slow internet provider. Would def recommend it to anyone. Better then paying over $100 a month on normal tv that you only watch a handful of shows on."
"2147","I bought this for my guest room to keep the cable cost down. After seeing all of the free streaming, im thinking of canceling cable all together. I see I can get all of my favorite shows for free."
"2148","Works well, but very disappointed it doesn't get YouTube. A couple of my grandchildren have their own little shows, and I'm back to my tablet to watching them. Perhaps I missed it in the write-up"
"2149","We just switched from cable to Playstation Vue to save a ton of money, and we bought this for our secondary television (using a PS4 for our primary television). The Fire TV Stick works great. Obviously it won't be as powerful as a bigger system, but it works just fine in rooms where you watch TV less or switch channels less. I'm very happy with our purchase and if we choose to purchase additional televisions in the near future, we'll be purchasing Fire Sticks for them as well!"
"2150","This is my second Fire TV stick. My husband and I don't always like to watch the same things at the same time. Since we have more than one TV, we needed another stick. I like the addition of Alexa to the stick, saves time scrolling through the library if you know what you want. The size of the stick makes it easy to throw into a bag and bring along. Just need WiFi.We travel seasonally, so having the fire stick with access to Amazon video, music, and the apps available to us wherever we go is fabulous since we never know what TV options we'll have otherwise."
"2151","I bought this hoping to use it in a room without a cable box.  I'm already a Charter Spectrum customer.  While the Firestick supports many cable providers, Charter Spectrum isn't one of them so really I can only use this with Amazon Prime and Netflix.  Also, a few weeks into using it, it froze up requiring me to reset it to factory settings to work again.  Not a big deal except that I lost all the apps and channel customizations I had put in.  Once (if) they get Charter Spectrum onboard this will be a great little device.  But as of now it's just not that useful."
"2152","Jury is still out as I only received the Fire Stick today & got it installed with DirectvNow.  So far am very impressed with the picture, seems more crisp than with cable. Have Amazon Prime & am happy with it so I feel that I will have the same success with the Fire TV stick. Besides, it is getting me off the Cable TV merry-go-round, it's time cable gets a wake up call as I know there are a lot of unhappy customers out there that have been stuck with cable or dish providers & their outrageous pricing practices for too long. Now there is an affordable alternative."
"2153","The firestick is a great accent to my entertainment needs however Im not impressed with the remote. Its a little too basic. If it had more buttins like a regular remote I think it would bne more useful."
"2154","The fire stick is a great alternative to cable. We love the fire stick. It gives us such a rebate of options with a small device. We prefer it to roku because it is smaller and works better. We have one for 4 tvs at home and are giving them and gifts."
"2155","We absolutely love our fire stick! This is the second one I've bought for our house. They are awesome and so convenient! We never watch regular tv anymore. I'm considering just cancelling our directv and saving $100 a month because this works awesome!"
"2156","My fiance had been talking about getting one of these for a long time and I was resistant because we could just hook up our laptop to the tv. Then finally I caved and we bought one. I should have listen to her sooner! This is so much more convenient then hooking and unhooking a laptop constantly. So many uses with all the apps you can install and very intuitive."
"2157","The device itself and software is easy to use. I enjoy the remote; it's simple and straightforward. Plus, the Alexa button is a bonus for those extra lazy days. I wish it would cast all videos though, like Googlecast does. If you find a video embedded on a webpage, I'd like to be able to cast it to my TV and not have to have an app to do it. I was hoping to replace my Googlecast as it is unreliable and crashes on my not-so-fast internet, but alas, I will have to keep them both to have the complete package as the fire stick is the only way to watch Prime Video on my TV."
"2158","Wonderful. I have the fire stick without Alexa and it was always jittery. This one is picture perfect, and so I traded my old one back in for a second with Alexa. You got it right Amazon. Thank you."
"2159","Got two of these this week so I could use my Prime sub and Netflix sub together, they work great.  Easy to take on the go and is very reliable.  Can't wait to dig deeper into the features it has!"
"2160","The fire stick was exactly what I needed for my smart TV. I love it! To start, you can't beat the price!. It's cheaper than similar gadgets out there. It has tons of apps and I like the Alexa voice recognition feature. Sometimes, you can lose your self with all the apps this little sucker has built in, and by using voice recognition, it brings you to the app you request, and done!  It's also easy to set up and connect to your wifi. Bottom line, for my needs this is exactly what I needed and more. Amazon, can't wait to see what other similar products you come up with."
"2161","At first I was skeptical about the Fire TV Stick. Wasn't sure I could set it up or if I would use it. Well it was EASY to install and now we pretty much watch everything on Amazon and Netflix. I plan on reducing my cable subscription (and costs!) when my contract is up since I now have a smart TV!I would recommend this product to anyone who has a Amazon Prime account and is sick of regular TV."
"2162","Stick is larger than I expected. Very simple connect works great. The remote could come with better instructions on all of the functions, but through trail and error we figured it out.  Haven't used the Alexa feature much yet so can't really comment on it."
"2163","We really enjoy the Amazon firestick, the Alexa app and the various apps to try and download, even a Catholic app! Many cost so much a month, so decide what you really enjoy like Netflix and Hulu, Amazon prime is great too! Recommend! Super fast setup too!"
"2164","I am impressed by this device. I love that Alexia is available to find things for me instead of endlessly searching for things. It’s great to hold a button and have your results within a few seconds. Clever. I’m happy."
"2165","Oh the Amazon fire stick is the option for cutting the cord!!!!"
"2166","I had the previous version of Fire Stick that did not have the voice remote and HOLEY MOLEY this small feature is such a BIG PLUS for me.  I am not the most tech savvy when it come to anything TV (just ask my husband about the DVD-CD player training that I have had multiple times) so when I saw the voice remote feature I knew I had to try it.  Sooo many times I have just turned the TV off because I couldn't find the program that I wanted to watch.  What a lifesaver this is.My husband never understood my frustration and is happy to hear zero whining now. :)"
"2167","The UI is smooth but it simplifies things a bit too much. They clearly did not want to make Netflix or YouTube easy to use. Wish I could filter out content that's for sell. The voice remote is nice but it was marketed as being a bit more intuitive and it's scope is limited."
"2168","Dear me where do I begin with my little fire stick...I'm just gonna sum up this review with one word. Awesome! Bye bye cable, hello every movie/tv show I can ever dream off! You'll have to tweak it yourself if you want to watch free movies and stuff however with just the normal use it's fast and operates smoothly. Best $35 I've spent on TV. Have to give amazon a good job for this one"
"2169","I bought it so that I could stream my movies and tv channels but have found out that the link between the Fire TV stick and CBS all access is not working properly.  CBS is supposedly working on the problem but it has been over a week with still no CBS all access.  I just wish the technical problems with streaming the different apps. were fixed so that I could stream my favorite apps."
"2170","I love this. Love having movies and tv and not having to pay cable bills. Works great except for sometimes it lags but not sure if it's the box or my internet. If it's my internet then I give it 5 stars!"
"2171","we love our Fire stick! easy to use. easy to install. the only thing Chromecast has over the Fire stick is that , with Chromecast, you can cast directly off of your computer screen on to the tv."
"2172","This new improved Fire TV stick meets and/or exceeds expectations. I replaced an old ROKU unit with this stick and it is so much quicker and user friendly. I now have three of them in the house."
"2173","this is my second fire stick. I broke the first one 6 mo ago. my wife wanted a new fire stick to play games. all the games she bought months ago was saved. love it more than we did the first one"
"2174","This is my 3rd fire stick and wouldn't be without them, my first 2 were not voice activated so I tend to forget at times about using the voice activation but when I do it responds extremely well"
"2175","Cannot live without my fire stick. Wish the remote was a little more sturdy & not so small. Also buttons could be better. Doesn't take much of an accidental bump to disrupt what you're watching."
"2176","Love It! So easy to connect a Grandma did it in 5 minutes. Alexa pulls up programs and will take you right back to where you left off in series. The system bypasses our other remotes. Botta boom!"
"2177","Love my new Fire TV stick! Works as advertised. I'm glad my old one died.... wouldn't have considered buying it otherwise. Alexa Voice was a good decision to offer to users of Amazon, Netflix, etc."
"2178","Love It! Got rid of a $170 cable bill and endless hours of searching for something to watch. Now I just ask Alexa to find exercise videos, tell me where the nearest Italian restaurant is or show me old episodes of Frasier. News is commercial free with Apps, and movies are half the price of going to the movies. We listen to music (with the lyrics showing on the screen) or we can fall asleep to the ""rain falling on tent"" video. TV is actually a choice and not a mindless stream of ..meh."
"2179","The device is a great low cost streaming stick that allows you to add on your own programs...cough cough Kodi cough. It is speedy and reliable with access to pretty much anything you could want."
"2180","It doesn't come with as much free stuff as you would think after purchasing this product. It's more of a gateway to get to other things in which you need to purchase stuff on them, in order to actually watch what you want to. Most of the good stuff actually costs money whereas the older stuff or not as good material is free through the ""prime channel"". The only reason why I have it two stars as opposed to one is because the use of the voice controlled remote is actually really cool."
"2181","LOVE this !!! ready to replace the other one in the front room!!! We don't even have the Alexa line (you know, dot or whatever), and it works. Now when I tune out my husband, he can talk to the remote!!! ;)"
"2182","This is a great streaming device for the money.  I got the original Fire TV box when it first came out and that is still working great.  We have that in the living room and our bedrooms have the Fire TV sticks."
"2183","I bought this to use with Kodi.But seeing how Dish has a lawsuit against Kodi & it is slowly getting closed down,It is useless for me, I will be returning it.By the way, this is an AMAZON product, but they will charge you for the shipping to return, if it does not work for you.Amazon are getting greedy like all big corporations!"
"2184","The Fire TV Stick is amazing!  It comes packaged as nicely as anything you would buy in an Apple Store. 5 minutes after unpacking it, I was all set up and ready to go. Connection to the TV and to WiFi is a breeze and the set-up menus are incredibly intuitive. 10 minutes after unpacking I had downloaded the Netflix app and set-up the Fire TVs parental controls. 15 minutes after unpacking I was playing the second game I had downloaded. 20 minutes after unpacking my whole family was taking turns to play this addicting game.  I can't believe I waited so long to get this!"
"2185","This is my second Fire stick and third fire device. I purchased it for my fiance to make accessing her programs and apps easier. This device makes is so easy to use and she loves it just as I do!"
"2186","the result is really good if:  you have high data internet streaming.  if you have time to download and register every channel you want.  plan a few hours for set up and possbile cost pymt, before fully available for your needs.i bought for a room we have no satellite in- for when company is in town.  still prefer for most use, live cable/satellite."
"2187","The worst feature of this thing HAS to be how SMALL the remote is. Tiny and black, it's virtually impossible to find. My family and I lose our remotes on a daily basis because they are so small. What's worse, on the chance that I do lose it and need to buy another one it is expensive AND ships within 5 weeks! Unbelievable and frustrating! Alexa doesn't work that great either, always have to repeat a command for it to work, if ever. Take the remote, and Alexa, back to R&D and make them better!!!"
"2188","Got a 2g Android tv box and it can’t beat the fire tv stick! Fire stick is much faster and it can also install apk ! just need some work to set it up! But it is all worth it! I dumped my tv box for fire stcik! But better get a blue tooth mouse keyboard for easier navigating."
"2189","This is my third firestick. I use them on two TVs in the house and keep one in my carryon bag for travel. I'm about to buy another as a housewarming gift. It works well with my wireless network."
"2190","We received our fire stick and hooked it up to our TV the process was very easy and worked immediately we had no problems on setup and got a service beyond that of Roku as well glad we ordered it."
"2191","Maybe when I finally order pizza or something with it, I'll be impressed. Otherwise it does what it's supposed to do *shoulder shrug*Although I really admire the fact that the HDMI-extender cord is included to help gain a better wi-fi signal if need be. Great customer service with that one, Amazon.I only wish the Home screen had the option to allow me to organize & see it the way that *I* want... then it would get 5 out of 5 stars from me."
"2192","There are somethings that could still be done better. We also have a Roku and Apple TV what I like about both is it is  easier to go back.  I have yet to find a back button. And if you you jail brake it you cannot use the speak to text."
"2193","The Fire Stick was simple to install and I had it working in no time.  I have not explored all the shows available, but I know it is excellent for Netflix.  I highly recommend."
"2194","Purchased in late January 2017 and fire stick remote stopped working in September out of nowhere holding the home button and all those tricks didn't work. I downloaded the remote app and I was able to control it but  shows wasn't working so I reset to factory settings and doing that lost my phone remote app connection and with the actual remote not working I can't use my fire stick now it's just stuck on the power up screen trying to find a connection to my broken remote"
"2195","A+++ too easy!!!After reading reviews for the fire TV stick w/Alexa remote, I decided this was wOrth a try... Absolutely NO regrets! User friendly and simple set up! - even for the NON tech savvy sort:O) I'm ready to toss the ROKU's we have & trade them ALL out. This product exceeded expectations, for sure!"
"2196","I had it for six months, does not have Spectrum App, anything you watch has to be buffering constantly, no Prime App you have to do a search to check content. I run Roku and Q7 which do not have this problem my WiFi runs 80-150 MBPS"
"2197","I very much enjoy all the features of the Amazon Prime movies, music, tv shows, etc, enabled by the jFirestick,  I have an older Sony Bravo TV and Best Buy recommended that I get a product that provided more than one HDMI port so I could use my Apple Box and Firestick whenever I want.  Your rep, Del, was very helpful and patient with me.  Thank You!  Capt Thorne, U.S. Coast Guard, Ret.I am considering purchasing the Alexa as I have friends who enjoy using it.  That's pretty cool."
"2198","I LOVE my firestick! Since getting this, I haven't missed my cable (which I cancelled because I don't even use it anymore)Will be getting one for every room so I don't have to move it from room to room - although, it isn't difficult or taxing to do!"
"2199","Very good.  Makes our outdated TV into a Smart TV...Had some issues in the beginning, but thanks to Amazon's Customer Support fixed all the glitches which actually were caused by Kodi.  Love it."
"2200","I have a fire tv box that I have had no problem with. With that said I bought my kids at fire stick it has been replaced 6 time 3 times through Amazon and 2 times through target(where I bought it at first).  The issue i am having is it keeps rebooting it takes over 45min for my kids to start a show then if they are lucky it won't reboot in middle of show"
"2201","Just got it yesterday but already love it!  Going cable free!!"
"2202","We love our fire stick. We ditched cable t.v. because they kept raising the rates and they didn't have a great choice of channels. With the fire stick we can watch so many free movies and documentaries. There are several channels like Showtime and HBO that you can pay for."
"2203","One of the best things I've bought this year. Life without cable is sweet. The only complaint I have is that using this with Sling results in freezes, but I'm suspecting it's the Sling service."
"2204","The interface for the fire stick is so much better than the alternatives.  We have used Tivo, DirectTV, Comcast Cable Box, Wii, and our Blu-ray player. The fire stick is by far my favorite interface.  It is responsive, easy to setup and more intuitive than some of the alternatives."
"2205","GREAT! Not because it's great but if you purchase a subscription service along with the Firestick it's wonderful.If you're a techy, ✋ on person who likes to fiddle with stuff then it's for you."
"2206","This is so cool. I cut off cable and so I've been trying out Roku and the fire stick. Works great with wifi in the house and I subscribed to Prime (so I get 2 day mailing as well as their movie/tv lineup)."
"2207","God bless Amazon.In my house we have a Roku, and Apple TV, and this Fire TV Stick. This one is the best by far and my favorite to use. I never have problems with it, and I love that you don't have to use all your other remotes to change the TV input to the input for the stick or to even turn the TV on."
"2208","I absolutely LOVE this fire stick it allows me to watch what I choose unlike cable u have to watch what they decide which is mostly reruns I'm so on full with watching Lord of the rings and law and order.....lol cable has become a thing if the past. For as much as it cost to have cable we should have a variety of options. The movies that play in theater should be free and they've moved all the good shows up in higher numbers do you have to purchase the highest package. I'm going to stop here I could go on forever.#AVERYUNHAPPYCUSTOMERWHOSFEDUPWITHCABLETV"
"2209","What an amazing thing to have!  I bought a Samsung BluRay player that pretty much proved to be worthless as far as getting online, would always freeze up, claim I had no internet.  Then I saw the Fire TV Stick at a fraction of what another BluRay would cost and I said WHY NOT?  It exceeding my expectations far and away than I thought I was getting.  Very, very happy! I ask, the time & weather, a desired show, ect.  Lots of free channels, plus all the favs! Great price to and not complicated to use, I love the simple remote!  Do yourself a favor, GET ONE TODAY!"
"2210","The amazon fire stick arrived quickly and looks just the same as pictured. It has been a life saver for us because all we had to watch was DVD, and we we were limited on those. My only complaints are all of the in app purchases you have to make aside from buying the fire stick, and also I wish there were more movies and TV series that came along with it."
"2211","As someone who exclusively used Roku for all my tv viewing, I wasn't sure this device could actually replace it. After my time spent with this, I now realize that this device is so much better than Roku that there's really no comparison. Yes Roku has more channels, but this is definately a matter of quality vs quantity. Amazon Fire TV even simply using the Stick has a lot more quality in both design and function. All the errors and lag I had with all 3 of the new Roku Streaming Sticks were nonexistant on the Amazon Fire TV Stick. This is a purchase I am definately happy with."
"2212","This is a great device, and very easy to set up.  I was able to connect it and set up my Amazon Prime, Netflix and Plex connections in less than 30 minutes!  This allows us to watch everything we love on our second TV, with easy menus and speech to search.  Love it!!"
"2213","I like having Netflix and Amazon Prime but this unit, for some reason, quits working right in the middle of programs and says it cannot connect. I have to go to home and reset the program. Very irratating. My Netflix on my other TV never does this, but it's not a fire stick, it's built into the TV."
"2214","Great product!Must download KODI"
"2215","I got this for my household and my sister and her husband really like it. We have been trying to find ways of leaving Cable... Now to just figure out how to get specific shows and channels like SciFi."
"2216","Very nice unit. I deducted 1 star, as I've found the Firestick tends to run hot.I had to install the extension cable to get it to run cooler. Remote control works well. Well, after 5 months of light usage, the Firestick has died."
"2217","Oh heavens, it's unlikely that my exercise routine will be expanded any time soon. My new Fire Stick has me firmly planted in my favorite chair, and there is so much to choose from.  I love the options I now have in my own living room!"
"2218","Great product and the price is reasonable.  Set up is easy and straightforward. My only wish is that it were easy to navigate for the less tech savvy. I am really happy with the shows that are available with my Amazon Prime membership. Many different genres to choose from to keep everyone satisfied. This is my second fire stick and will be purchasing another in the near future for my daughter who has the Roku and wishes she instead purchased the firestick. Great product, great price, lots of apps and selections."
"2219","Great item to have for your TV viewing. NO CABLE NEEDED. Got a tv that's not Smart, then you need this. Now with the remote being an  Alexa responsible, just tell it what you want to watch and make being a couch potato even easier."
"2220","Alexa makes TV viewing so easy. Tell the small, hand-held unit what you want to watch, and...boom! Being a Prime Member for so many years, it's only getting better! Great Amazon produced movies and TV series. I'm cutting the cable!"
"2221","If Comcast is your cable provider the majority of the television station apps such as Food Network, Travel Channel, A&E, etc. are not available. That should be disclosed prior to purchase. Very disappointing!"
"2222","About a year we bought the fire tv box and loved it. Wound up getting rid of cable altogether and using Netflix, PlayStation Vue, and Amazon video.  Since then, I have gotten a fire stick for each bedroom tv and one for the deck tv. They are great, have great signal, very responsive, and hosts a large variety of third party apps"
"2223","Even tho it has alexa remote there is no way to have the larger echo Controll the TV I had bought it cuz I figured they would pair up. Google home can Controll the Chromecast but echo can't controll another Alexa device lame. I like my echo better it is louder and taller and has better lights to let me know if it hears me right then Google home but I wish I could Controll my TV too. I've already returned fire stick. It would be about the SAME price for me to get fire TV that can do 4k and to just buy a Google home to Controll my Chromecast ready 4k shield tv."
"2224","It's great when it works. However, I guess my internet coverage is a little spotty. Every now and again my internet will drop but the wifi signal will be full strength. Now, that isn't a problem for my PC, laptop, or iPhone, but for the stick it's a showstopper and requires several minutes to pick up the signal again. This seems like a huge flaw, and it's just something amazon is not doing right with their protocol. Ideally, my internet connection would be flawless and I wouldn't pay almost $100 a month for lag but this is the world we live in. Buffer better."
"2225","Not sure the point of Alexa. It hasn't worked for me the 3-4 times I've tried it, but it was a Christmas gift. As far as the Fire Stick itself, I love it. If you're thinking about one I wouldn't spring the extra money for the voice control. It's a gimmicky feature. On another note, my Smart TV remote synced up with it seamlessly. Kind of figured it out that it could do that by accident. Used the tv remote to switch sources to the fire stick, and forgot to switch. 5 minutes later I realized I was using my TV remote to control the Fire Stick. Pleasant surprise."
"2226","Wondered why I would need this, but after having it for an hour I realised what a great purchase this is. With Prime I have access to Music, a bunch of the free instant videos, and my photos. I can now get Netflix all on my TV (which was not a ""smart tv""). It was easy to set up and Alexa works pretty well, there's no access to CrunchyRoll, which is a shame, but I can get YouTube and HBO among many others. Perhaps I'll resubscrive to Hulu so my kids can get their Anime fix. Also wish I could access to Lynda.com through it. Already bought more as gifts."
"2227","You can't beat $40. The Alexa voice control works awesome. Super easy set up. One small issue when I plugged it in the first time the whole screen had a green tint. I unplugged it and plugged it back in again and it was perfect. Haven't had any problems since."
"2228","Used this for my attempt to be a ""cord cutter""The signal into my bedroom for the wifi was not strong enough. Once I got an extender this worked great. I have even used it to order items from amazon just by asking it.  I am quite satisfied so far."
"2229","I researched several different devices before buying the Fire Stick.  For the price, voice search, and the variety of content providers, the Fire Stick seems to provide the best value for your money.  It is also great having Bluetooth built in.  I connect this to my projector that I use for both outdoor movies as well as in my basement.  Connection with my Bluetooth speakers is quick and easy without having to run extra wiring.I'm also starting to use Amazon Photos so it is great to show off pictures of my kids through the projector as well!  Definitely worth money!!!"
"2230","Hello they are listening to you! Or so they say. Otherwise unbelievable in its easy use. Though often it will not understand my English(American) language...which is frustrating!  Or it will find something and I ask to play that something and it has no clue what Im talking about. Really? But for the price and lack of security can't beat it!"
"2231","Love that I can take tbe fire stick anywhere that has internet connect and watch my favorite shows. All I have to do I s connect it to the HDMI port on most tv and sit back and enjoy. Love alexia voice command."
"2232","How did live without this? I love my fire stick."
"2233","I am very impress with the item because of the name. I purchased the Fire TV box previously and I am very satisfy with using the device, which has been installed one 1 TV. With the stick I will not be limited to 1 TV, but can move it around to other TVs inside the home or in traveling to other destinations."
"2234","The fire stick is awesome. High quality streaming video from multiple applications with a snappy user interface and sleek control. Unfortunately they didn't design for reliability. Of the two units I bought, one failed within 4 months. Endless buffering on Netflix every few minutes and no amount of restarting the firestick, restarting the app, or switching wifi bands helps. I'm going to get the extended warranty on the next one or purchase a different streaming device."
"2235","This device is cool! The use of voice commands saves lots of time, and my not so smart TV is now pretty smart. When I have used my computer in the past to watch computer shows, the sound was often (usually) not synchronized with the picture, but with the Fire stick the synchronization is always perfect. I recommend adding the Side Click to the remote, which will allow you to control your TV volume, inputs, etc., via infrared signals. I also recommend the ""Bosch"" series on Amazon Prime."
"2236","Clunky interface and missing at least one of my streaming services Vudu in the apps. I will use this for prime video only as my Chromecast seems to be a better interface and selection of apps."
"2237","I gave this to the hubs for his tv.  The monthly service has yet to be used since he installed it. He especially enjoys the Alexa remote to find what he wants.  The new wave for tv watching !!"
"2238","I highly recommend this product for ease of use.  While it lacks the overall versatility of a Chromecast (the ability to cast directly from the Chrome browser), it is easier to use for my parents and allows them to quickly launch Netflix, YouTube, and any other streaming service they would use.  If there is one area to improve, it would be the internal search feature on apps like YouTube and the ability to search for apps.  The ability to search is very clunky and definitely not intuitive."
"2239","Everything it's cracked up to be. Wouldn't live without mine."
"2240","Very intuitive to setup and use.  Use it daily with a companion remote that attaches to it (basically like a big single remote) to control the tv, and especially enjoy the voice feature of this unit.."
"2241","So easy to set up, I let my 11 year old ""help"" me.  :)  We love it so far!  Cut the cord and are now a purely streaming household.  We went from a $230/mo bill for cable/internet to a $105/mo bill for internet/Hulu/Netflix/Sling and Amazon Prime (which I'd have regardless, so I don't count it as a tv charge).  Not bad, eh?If anyone has other suggestions on how to manage my newfound streaming existence, please let me know!But back to the topic at hand, the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote was VERY easy to set up.  I like the voice remote feature."
"2242","This version of the Firestick was purchased because the first generation did notwork well with the new streaming service, FILMSTRUCK.  A very nice feature ofthis Firestick with Alexa is that the inquiry to Alexa displays results on the TV screen:for example, in Amazon music, the artist's picture [usually] plus the song information;even weather inquires to very foreign and arcane locations display with the entire week'sforecast! [Should your travel plans include a remote city in Siberia or a location in theAustralian Outback]"
"2243","Extremely happy with purchase. This was all new to me. Very easy setup and voice is a nice addition. I'm interested in the fire box but would love to see amazon have an OTA DVR option with it."
"2244","I had heard a lot about this devise, finally had the chance to experience it and I love it. Really love the apps that are used with this fire-stick. Most of all I enjoy using the voice remote."
"2245","I'm trying to steer away from cable and I continue to find ways to love this Fire Stick. There's a lot of shows and apps you can get without having to make any purchases and I really like that. I'm considering buying another for my father to use. Highly recommended."
"2246","For those without cable this is the best option."
"2247","When I first connected the Fire TV Stick to my Samsung Plasma TV the picture was terrible with no highlight details, poor color and poor resolution. I checked all of the settings and nothing worked until I power cycled the stick by unplugging it for 5 minutes. This improved the picture a great deal but it is still inferior to my Comcast cable. For reference, my internet download speed is over 50 Mbps so I don't think that's the problem.Otherwise, the interface is very good and easy to use. The stick meets my expectations except for the picture quality."
"2248","Finally cut the cord on cable and this is way better than I thought it would be. Between Netflix, SlingTV, and everything one can access with Amazon Prime (substantial), there is a ton of content - and this is only scratching the surface of what is available. And was stoked that all my downloaded Amazon music was available too. Also, since the entertainment system receiver is older and does not contain an HDMI port, used the following to make it all work: E-More 1080P HDMI To Component of Ypbpr Scaler Converter Supporting Coaxial Audio Output"
"2249","I bought this as an upgrade to my Roku, expecting the voice recognition as a nice feature. Unfortunately, the Alexa part fails to connect to the server repeatedly. It also fails normal voice recognition. It has gotten to the point where I just use the remote to connect to the features I want.The good parts of it are the interface is clean and shows my Netflix and Amazon Prime account lists from the home screen. I do like the navigation slightly more then on my old Roku. I might consider it as a new purchase but not anything great as a new upgrade."
"2250","Absolutely, AMAZING Love this thing use it everyday for at-least 7 hours great for watching movies, or tv shows don't really play games on it, but i wouldn't doubt it when it comes to it. this thing continues to surprise me definitely a Great buy. Im Probably going to buy as gifts for a few friends because it is considerably cheap for the kind of product you get."
"2251","We use it in our bedroom on a non smart tv and works perfect!  Alexa voice seems to work well and like that it has my amazon prime items ready to listen to or watch.  Very happy with purchase."
"2252","Mind blowing comes close. My disappointment came when I realized how much in added fees like HBO, Netflix's and other programming would cost me. Lots of free stuff but to really enjoy this you'll have something similar to your cable bill."
"2253","We are so tired of paying for a hundred cable channels of junk programming and were looking for a TV streaming alternative.  The Fire Stick is our first experience with streaming and I'm happy to say it's better than expected.  Very easy to install, sharp hi-def pictures, smooth streaming and a large selection of programs. A bargain as I see it.  Goodbye cable and hello over-the-air TV antenna for local weather programming to supplement Fire Stick."
"2254","I had Chromecast and while I enjoyed that (they are great too, I do sometimes miss being able to 'cast' to my TV - maybe this can do it too), but I did not like using my phone as a remote. I like to 'shut off' when I watch movies and TV and having my phone right next to me all the time was bothersome, so I got this instead and I love it. I also really love the voice control. It's so easy to use! Great product. I've since purchased one for my mother and father as well."
"2255","So far so good.  We have had it about three weeks and not used it a whole lot.  It was easy to set up and Alexa understands our verbal commands.  I am looking forward to more usage in the future."
"2256","This is the best and cheapest device to have in the place of cable tv. I love all my tv shows. I don't need a smart tv because this device turns your tv into one. Thanks worse the money I sent"
"2257","I am in love with it.  Recently my computer broke and it was going to be a while until I could fix it.  So we got this and the only problem I have had was the remote was always freezing.  I think it was the Amazon batteries that were cheap that they gave you with the remote.  But besides that I love it!  It works for every need I have!"
"2258","It's pretty good and easy to work with for streaming things to my tv, but I've had a fair number of issues too. My router is not that far from my stick (I'm in a small 2 bedroom apartment) but there are wifi issues sometimes. Even more frustrating, on multiple occasions the fire stick restarts itself. I think it's because it gets really hot, but I've been watching for less than an hour, why is it so hot? So overall it's not bad, but you could probably find a better product for your money."
"2259","This product saved me so much money already. I don't have to pay for multiple cable boxes in different rooms, I just download all the cable apps to the Fire TV Stick and saved $20 a month on cable box rentals!"
"2260","My favorite gadget since my second generation iPod I got in 2003 or 04. So easy to set up, to use, and great free selections with my Amazon Prime membership. This was my second purchase of one, now on two TVs."
"2261","This new Fire TV Stick is slick.  I have tried various streaming devices (Roku, Apple TV, Chrome Cast) and each have their benefits and uses.  The Amazon Fire TV Stick is fast, and so far I have not had any buffering issues what so ever.  I still want to test casting from my device to the TV as Apple TV has been my go-to method for this.  The main reason I purchased this was to use while traveling for business which I have yet to test.  This will be the big deal-breaker for me.Still, for $39, this seems a great deal for a streaming solution.  So far, highly recommend."
"2262","A lot better than paying for cable or satellite TV.  I also have the Fire Box unit.  So far I cannot tell the difference in the box or the stick.  However, the FireStick is much cheaper. I would give a ""5"" if not for the stalling, or sometimes losing certain channels.But overall, GREAT!"
"2263","The Fire TV Stick is really nice.  It has turned my 10 year old LCD into a smart tv.  We don't watch a lot of television/movies so I cannot provide a comprehensive review.  However, the setup and use of the Fire Stick is basically automatic.  Alexa voice command is very cool and quite a time saver.  The content layout/app selection is very easy to navigate, and you can ask Alexa to find your show/movie and it's displayed on screen in a matter of seconds.  Still lots to learn about this item, should have picked one up much sooner.  Next up is an OLED screen!"
"2264","Very small and portable.  That's number one for me.  Has plenty of channels/apps to satisfy most people.  One being the beta app for Tivo that i use a lot but don't see in Roku units.  The little dongle that is supplied also makes it easy to attach to TVs that has non-friendly HDMI ports for Firestick.  Now if Alexa voice control worked in every app then that would have been 5 stars.  Overall a great unit if you have Prime but a good unit nevertheless if you don't.  Amazon - for future modification, the hand remote battery cover is a pain to open and close."
"2265","The quality of the picture is great, however the inability to get all of my local stations is regrettable. I am only able to receive our local CBS affiliate ""live"".  ABC, NBC and FOX are all delayed and do not contain the local news/weather. I had hoped to use this device to replace my current satellite provider entirely, but will unfortunately not be able to do so. I plan to use the device on another TV in my home that does not have access to YouTube, Netflix, etc. Overall, not the results I expected."
"2266","Programming and everything works fine. Picture is slightly ""wider"" than my TV. checked my TV's settings, and nothing there to adjust. Firestick keeps saying check TV settings. Yet it is the only thing I've ever had the wide issue with.Constantly, makes me re log into my wireless network after watching something for about an hour (plus or minus 10 minutes).Product is great otherwise. Could just be me, could happen to others. My review is a 2 because it's inconvenient to me, and I don't use it that often because of the issues I have."
"2267","I purchased two as part of my cable cutting scheme.  I was considering a Roku device but reviews indicate that Amazon's app for Playstation Vue is superior to Roku's.  I'd be willing to pay more for improved build quality and improved tactile quality of the buttons but I think it's a great product at the price.  I highly recommend if you're considering subscribing to Vue."
"2268","I don't know how I've lived this long without this (52 years)! I'm so glad these ""technology"" things have finally gotten easy to set up & use. I couldn't be happier with my Fire TV Stick."
"2269","Love the remote, easy to setup.I would like the ability to have different profiles - say one for kids and another for parents.Wish Amazon hadn't removed Kodi from their app store."
"2270","I was surprised to go d it in stock. Ordered and came on ti.e as expected. I used my phone to use a YouTube video to install my own apps made some settings changes and  it was up and run ing in just a few minutes. I would like  to see it control volume. My only complaint."
"2271","The firestick itself is great. Be prepared to install the app for the remote on your phone or iPad because the remote won't work for more than a week. I got a replacement and it's worse than the first. I have spent hours trying everything that every fix recommended to no avail. I don't have a smart TV so using that remote is not an option. Even using the app on my iPad, it constantly loses the connection. Very frustrating. I sincerely hope Amazon will fix this issue."
"2272","I am loving the Fire TV Stick.  I am a 50-something single mom who uses technology but hasn't fully embraced it (ie, I'd be happier if someone else would deal with the tech stuff).  I was frustrated by my $204/month cable bill (for BASIC Cox cable and internet) and after multiple failed attempts to get my bill lowered, I finally bit the bullet and cut the cord.The Fire TV Stick (around $40) was a breeze to install, as was the HDTV antenna (I chose the ""1byone 50 Miles Amplified HDTV Antenna"" from amazon, about $30).  I was shocked that the HDTV Antenna gave me more than 50 local stations (about half are in English) - the basic stations (NBC, ABC, CBS) look clear and crisp on my TV - much better than I thought possible without cable.  I enjoy the movies available with my Prime membership, but I wanted more TV shows for the kids, so I signed up for Hulu and CBS All-Access (combined, less than $20/month).  And I bought season 9 of the Real Housewives of NY ($25).  My monthly internet bill is now $99/month. I couldn't be happier.There is a bit of an adjustment when going from ""channel surfing"" with cable to ""on demand"" with the Fire Stick.  Personally, I don't miss the ""surfing"" at all but it definitely is a change for our household.  We haven't had any issues with ""buffering""  - everything launches quickly, by our standards.If you're on the fence about cutting the cord, I'd encourage you to give it a try.  It really was not as difficult as I thought it would be."
"2273","So much easier to set up than the chrome! Plugged it in, my account was already set up and started streaming in less than a minute! The picture quality and audio is excellent. I’m very happy."
"2274","I  am probably the only one - that bought this device - just to get HBO-GO.  The rest I don't care much about.  I've been getting the Amazon icon to open on my sony blu ray player = all along.  My smart tv - (ha) Samsung that had the HBo GO icon loaded on it vanished and the tech tells me my 6 year old TV is ""old"" and they removed the icon for security purposes (go figure).  Long story about nothing - but buying the fire stick was for the utility of the HBOGO app..  It works fine.  Maybe over time - I'll find something else that I would like of this device."
"2275","I think it's the best thing since sliced bread"
"2276","Best purchase ever! We fought with the PS4 remote dying all the time when watching Netflix or Amazon video. This has been an excellent purchase and my husband loves it too. Would be very easy to take with you on vacation as well!"
"2277","I love the Fire TV Stick after loading it. I have watched a lot in the short time I've had it. Now my only issue is getting local channels for the news. Once I get that I will cancel my cable subscription."
"2278","We have smart TVs, Apple TVs, a Roku and the Firestick. Firestick is the best price, particularly with an Alexa discount. We mostly watch Netflix, sometimes Amazon Prime and it does that well."
"2279","Love it. Does everything I need. Works great with direct now and other tv apps which I couldn't find trying out countless android boxes.  I love how it shows features for Netflix, prime, and hbo"
"2280","I received this yesterday and installed it in less than 5 minutes. Easy to use and the choice of cintenrs is great.  Being an amazon prime member, the choices are amazing.  I highly recommend this device. Well worth the $29.99 and the expedited shipping I paid a bit extra for. Also having the Alexa function is an added bonus. I am very happy with his purchase."
"2281","Love the Fire TV Stick. You also have the option to download apps for broadcast  and cable stations that might lead me to cutting the cord and get rid of my cable provider!  Works like a charm."
"2282","If you are going to buy a firestick definitely buy one using your prime account. All of your account settings are pre-loaded so there is not need to spend 20 minutes putting your information in. Very happy with this setup."
"2283","This is an excellent product, much superior to a smart TV or smart DVD player that I used before. It's easy to setup, easy to use and, importantly, very fast and responsive. Though I have not used the voice control yet, I appreciate  a quick access to the movies of interest to me, and a wide selection on Amazon Prime. The main advantage over Apple TV, which I also use, is the selection of shows and movies included in Prime membership. I also like the access to my favorite music and the cloud storage with my personal library of photos. In summary, it's a good buy for $39.99."
"2284","Nice but started seeing commercials.  Not on the programming, but on the menu."
"2285","About a year into using the stick it is crashing while running apps. Based on my use, the HBO app and Netflix apps occasionally go blank and revert to the Fire Stick's home screen. Very annoying."
"2286","love it!!! I used to use my PS3 for tv streaming but this fire stick knocks it out the park. its far superior ,great picture, no buffering,I can stream from all of my tv accounts. love the fire stick"
"2287","A vast improvement over the previous Fire TV Stick. This is a really clever piece of technology, saves so much time, no need to type search with the old slow buttons, just ask Alexa. Brilliant! And the three year warranty was only $4.99"
"2288","Only thing wrong with the remote, it doesn't light up at night so I can see the buttons. Otherwise, I love Amazon Fire Stick. I can watch The Man in the High Castle and possibly other shows."
"2289","I really like it. Once you set it up, it's easy to use. I think it does a lot more than I have programmed for at the moment but I'll get there. I would definitely recommend it to my friends."
"2290","This was easy to set up and now I have the benefit of all Amazon Prime movies on my TV. Because it also incorporates a Netflix app I've unplugged the Chromecast device that gave us other apps on the TV."
"2291","My ""smart"" Sony tv started constantly losing connection to the internet after only having it for 3 months.  When I began researching I learned that this seems to be a frequent problem with Sony TV's, much to my dismay.  I also learned that getting the issue fixed is incredibly time-consuming and cumbersome at best.Enter Amazon Fire Stick with Alexa voice remote.  Purchased it on sale...a $29 fix and like the options much better than the smart TV options.This turned out to be more a rant against Sony products, BUT I LOVE THE FIRE STICK!!!!!!!"
"2292","Works well, especially if you don't have a smart tv.Only CON is the remote. After a mere month of use, the center button has become ""sticky"" and isn't clicking correctly."
"2293","Really great and convenient. I just wish that it was programmed with the free version of CBS as well as, all access. It should have all the free local apps. Also, don't like that if someone else in the house logs onto Amazon prime that it takes over the firestick."
"2294","First 3 incredible.  Great.  Wonderful remote!!  Way better than Apple TV and incredibly affordable.  Most recent 2 didn't work right.  Have bought 5;  love the 3, but 2 didn't work right and returned.  Note:  Amazon's return people were incredibly good.  <24 hours response!!  They will send new one!!  Amazing."
"2295","It's a great streaming device, however, if you have a smart tv, all the items on the Fire stick are on your tv and vice versa. It's great if you don't have a smart tv or cable but if you do, i don't see a difference."
"2296","I shouldn't have bought this. I have a Roku box already which does everything this does and much more. It costs more also, but I already had it is the point. I should donate it to a library or something."
"2297","The light grey text on dark grey background is a poor choice for UI colors. Yes, it's clean but difficult to read. Praying for a firmware update to fix this. Otherwise it is totally awesome."
"2298","I was a little more than impressed at how small and easy it was to setup.  I really like that it actually had one of our local news channels.  We recently cut the cable cord and having amazon prime and hulu plus (without commercials) is way cheaper and tons of programs.  With the fire stick with voice it's so easy to switch between Prime and Hulu and local news.  The only reason I knocked one star off is because of the loud clicking noise you hear when navigating the menus.  I picked it up on sale for 29.95 and it is well worth that or the 39.95 normal price."
"2299","works ok most of the time, so far. I've had it working for 2 days (took a while to install kodi and covenant properly). If I could do it again, I'd have purchased the fire tv box rather than the stick because the box has an ethernet port and seems to be a bit ""beefier"" in terms of heat resistance. My wife received a box as a gift from her daughter a year ago but they won't let me jailbreak it. (PRUDES)"
"2300","We had an ancient streaming box and replaced it with a Fire Stick and I love it. Super easy. No fuss no muss. Amazon movies and shows at the touch of a button OR ask Alexa to get it for you."
"2301","We bought one after my brother in law said how much they were enjoying theirs they bought several.  We have had it for a couple weeks and really like it.  It takes a little getting use to but my husband seems to have no problem already."
"2302","While the end result is good, the product was  difficult to assemble. It took an herculean effort to insert the batteries to the remote, since access was impeded by a too tightly fitting  cover (battery door)."
"2303","I love this thing. I purchased one for my in-laws to make their tech life simpler. I instantly fell in love with it and bought one for myself. The best part is the voice feature.  It is smarter than my smart TV!"
"2304","I purchased the stick so I could connect to directs, now I find out I cannot connect to it.Directive now is not the same and in talking with tech help we could not locate the proper app.Very unhappy!"
"2305","I love love love my new Fire stick. The original one I bought just decided to stop working for me and when I was able to get this one and get it home i started streaming my shows immediately."
"2306","Haven't had a single problem with the product. We'll be ordering a third for us and one for my son at school. WAY better than our Sony box, and can do things like Beachbody on Demand so easily."
"2307","Really wanting to get rid of Directv but was so nervous about it. Finally bought a Firestick for the main TV to try it out. Added Hulu, then upgraded to their no commercial plan- worth it by the way. Now I just need to get a decent antenna for local channels, recommendations welcome, and we are cutting the cord. Will save us nearly $1200 a year on cable! I wish I had done this years ago and some of Amazon's original shows are great! Excited to check out more. With the bonus of Prime Music through the TV and all the apps we've downloaded, this thing is amazing."
"2308","So happy! It is the better than my ROKU.  Love it!"
"2309","WORKS AS ADVERTISED.  JUST WHAT -WE- NEEDED, ANOTHER THING WITH BUTTONS ON IT; TV, CABLE, PORTABLE LAND LINEPHONE, CELL PHONE, RECLINER CONTROLLER  STILL ACCESSES SOME GOOD VIDEOS/MOVIES."
"2310","This is great as long as you have fast internet. However setting it up is ridiculously hard. There are no instructions that come with it. If my daughter wasn't here from Florida, I would still be trying to figure it out. Also, you can't UST it on my Santo TV. There is no sound."
"2311","It is nice but the new version does NOT have the same options.  The new one does not have TBS which is a HUGE disappointment to me.I rarely use the voice option as it just seems to increase the number of steps you need to get to where you really want to go.  I have not used it much as it always came up with the wrong answer - unless I was looking for the weather.My goal is to be cable free and it does not do that as you have to have cable codes to access many of the applications.  It is so difficult to end the stranglehold of the cable companies."
"2312","Will need to get 2 more of these for our other 2 televisions. Then get some for gifts for the holidays. This is great. Works fast easy to set up and of course has  Amazon's amazing apps. Love it!"
"2313","Disappointed. Last night my fire stick remote stopped working. It's August, 2017 and I purchased this product in October, 2016. Did not last a year. My Roku literally lasted even after the apps were not supported."
"2314","Took a little bit of figuring out as it came with no directions, but it wasn't difficult. Had to add Netflix for more content."
"2315","Got tired of moving the fire TV box back and forth from the bedroom TV to the living room TV, this works perfect in my living room. Much cheaper than the firebox. Does the exact same thing."
"2316","Not sure exactly what to think of this.  I like the fact that it took my ordinary HDTV and turned it into a smart TV.  Was able to connect to my Amazon prime with no problem.  The voice recognition is difficult to navigate - easy to type then multiple attempts to understand my voice.  I am still hoping that it will replace my cable but unfortunately there are stations that are only available if I still have basic cable so the only thing I will be reducing is the cost of monthly rental of the cable box.  Overall I still like it!!!"
"2317","Alexa has become welcome in my life. At first I forgot it was there. After programming it to explain everything and, at first, regretting it I became aware how really helpful Alexa is. It was difficult for me to read the printed  reviews and no problem Alexa has helped.  It has only been a short time that I have had FireTV. Every day  find more ideas for questions for Alexa. It's also fun when I am not pronouncing clearly to hear what Alexa comes up with. Thanks for this and and the opportunity to view more than could without it."
"2318","I originally bought the Firestick to stream Beachbody on demand. It doesn't work with BOD. The app will load but not go past the loading screen, such a bummer."
"2319","The Firestick is a definite winner! Love Amazon movies, being able to watch Blaze TV and YouTube on my non-smart TV. I love buying these for gifts for friends and we have one in every room!"
"2320","Actually, my son-in-law hooked it up in our vacation home, so I can't comment on that process, but using it is super simple and allows me access to just about everything I'd ever want to watch.  Love it, and ordering another for my home TV."
"2321","We love this! We watch movies or shows almost every night. When there is not much at RedBox, we always find something on here. Most definitely recommend this especially if you have Amazon Prime. Great buy!"
"2322","I heard about Fire TV Stick from a acquaintance, they said how great it was and how much they enjoyed it. After hearing this I decided to get one for myself. They were right it is great! I am enjoying movies from the past as well as the present."
"2323","Doesn't really get the voice recognition for words.  I can't look up shows in hulu plus which you can link through the fire stick.  Works good for amazon prime members.  With all the other options like Psvue or Xbox live, or hulu live it's not worth it.  The worst part is you can't turn it off, you have to unplug it.  Unplugging is the safest way to prevent monitoring of all my television watching experience."
"2324","Bought the stick in order to use the PlayStation Vue app. The app itself is a little laggy at times but mostly works wonderful. We are also using for Netflix and Prime steaming. It's easy to use and we haven't had any issues so far.  I've used Roku boxes for the longest time but have now taken a preference to the fire stick."
"2325","If the controller gets lightly tapped it turns the Amazon stick on, pauses your show or fast fwds. This happens often at my house with having kids. But the most frustrating thing is. I have amazon prime, hulu, an netflix so then I am going threw looking at things to watch and it cost money.  New seasons cost money. Really disappointed that they don't have a way to just not show up shows you can watch without making you pay for them."
"2326","If you own the old fire stick like me, you should get this new one. It's faster and smoother.With the old fire stick (dual core), I had stutter and judder on 1080p movies / tv shows.Everything is smooth now, just as I expected."
"2327","All-New Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player Best thing ever we have like 4 in our house and got my family some too. Its amazing from the movies to the apps you can have on your TV. and one of my favorites is the music part it has TONS TONS TONS of selections anything you can think of from today and from way back when but the best part is the lyrics are on the screen its pretty cool. The alexa voice control makes it so much easier finding tv shows movies music its awesome. For the price it is great. 10 stars"
"2328","I have 2 fire sticks one with voice and one with out. Hands down the voice remote if my favorite. If there was a way that my voice remote could work with both fire sticks I would throw out the non-voice remote. It is just a time saver and more accurate than my typing.I have now purchased another one but it sure would be nice to not need a remote for each device at some time I am afraid I will have the wrong remote in the room with the incorrect device. Need to find a way that you can have one remote work with multiple fire sticks and dot and echo."
"2329","A new experience to our family...we are not to tech savvy.  We were worried about installation, but the fears were not to be found.  Very simple hook up and viewing is great.  Great selection of shows to watch right now...and free for the ones we have watched."
"2330","We wanted to watch an AAmazon video on our TV screen. Our cable TV provider did not have a link, so the Fire TV Stick provided the needed link. Quality of image, data flow rate & audio is great"
"2331","So much much faster to access prime video, netflix, etc.  - compared to using xbox 360 (wifi) or plugging ethernet cable into tv - used to take very long.  + love the options to subscribe to cable access channels, & voice command is ++"
"2332","This is great!  I has taken me about a week to navigate and find different applications for ""Live"" TV.  I will be cutting the cord from Comcast soon!  I do have one concern with Live TV - I am PST and all shows are EST - not sure how to set for my time zone"
"2333","My goal is to have one for every TV in the house! I LOVE the amazon fire stick! Our family has been able to completely cut out cable thanks to this amazing product! This, hulu, and netflix, along with our internet provider and we're still able to watch all of our favorite tv shows and movies!"
"2334","We love the firestick!  I even took it On a recent trip and plugged it into our hotel tv.  The firestick is more than I expected as you can watch live tv,Movies, Netflix, prime,'etc.  I could go on and on."
"2335","Much faster than the other gens.  Opted to not get a smart tv recently and went with a smart cast one because the fire stick essentially makes your tv a smart tv.  Except I find the apps run much smoother on the fire stick.  The typical smart tv apps are not always updated and lag.  Glad I can take it with me on vacation and what not .. once signed into xfinity wifi.Be patient the screen will come up to sign in. (It says error when you sign in through xfinity wifi..  Just keep pressing sign in... it will after several attempts) gonna be gifting this bad boy this Christmas."
"2336","This unit works as advertised; the first unit that came in the mail did not work and we had to exchange it. My only question is this: we have this Fire Stick, a WiFi capable DVD play, and a smart TV. Our primary purpose for each of these is to access Amazon Prime; on each of these devises Prime appears differently so navigating on each unit has been a new learning experience.  It would be nice if navigation process were the same on all devices."
"2337","Easy to use, easy to hide behind the tv, using the Alexa feature is nice for guest that don't know to use technology. Put the fire stick in the guest room and just told guest to talk to the remote to find things and they seemed to be able to do it.I will say, I was thoroughly impressed with how it was packaged. I thought I was unboxing an apple product the way everything was perfectly thought of. Also asking Alexa the weather is a cool feature. If all you want is Netflix and Amazon streaming this is right for you. Other than that, I would not recommend."
"2338","The idea is great. Potentially wonderful, however, quality of some shows are very very poor and other shows just do not come in at all. Still trying to see what the options are to make this work, if possible."
"2339","I have recently ""cut the cord"" and subscribed to Hulu and this gadget fits the bill. At times having a hard time to connect with router which is not too far away so I have to reset but not all the time."
"2340","Thought I was going to use this product more. Obviously it's a great product if you're trying to watch Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, or order a Dominos Pizza, however, it just wasn't my cup of tea.The remote is great at voice recognition, and it's pretty easy to use."
"2341","Set up was super easy, the remote responds quickly, and the design is great. This is definitely a step up from the Chrome Cast, and this device is a serious contender in the streaming device market. It sounds stupid, but my favorite part of the set up was that Amazon had a video play during the loading process. This added element kept me engaged during the set up process, rather than just showing a boring ""Loading. Please wait"" screen. Very smart Amazon, very smart. Overall it's a great product, and well worth the money."
"2342","First off let me say I never review anything!!!!! But once I got this set up and jail broken I had to do a review! The only con I have is that with the movies that are still in the theater I didn't realize they were going to be bootleg movies. That's why some reviews say the picture quality is terrible but other than that I LOVE IT!!! Bye bye cable bill"
"2343","It's a very good product but it is bad that it does not have basic feature of browsing. It would be good if it can support android apps supported by phones. MotoGP VideoPass app is not there for fire tv which is a shame.If you compare this to Apple TV or Chromecast.. choke cast is total useless and Apple TV not worth the money. This is a value product except for few feature support"
"2344","My smart TV would not play my movies in the cloud, most streaming would stop and buffer because of 'bandwidth"". Using the Fire stick fixed this problem. No problem with bandwidth again."
"2345","It's ok. Runs really slow before connecting to a site to watch something. It has to be restarted every day or two to clear the ""memory"" that it stores or video's start to freeze up or stop all together. I would not recommend a firestick for major TV viewing. It's just nice to have to find certian movies and old TV shows that aren't on regular TV anymore."
"2346","Lots of movie selections, but disappointed in how many you have to pay to watch, when they aren't even new.  Fairly easy to set up, except for getting the back off the remote to put the batteries in.  Haven't had it for very long, so I am still getting used to using it.  Love the voice remote."
"2347","Still working with it. The remote is almost impossible to get the batteries in (had to youtube it). The device has to plug into the wall on a cord that is not really long but I made it work in my case. If this was used for my primary tv I would probably get Apple TV. Their products just work easily in my opinion."
"2348","I upgraded from the previous generation and this 2016 model blows it out of the water. Load times are much faster and menus are very snappy. I debated between purchasing this, a Chromecast, and the new Apple TV, and I am very pleased with my decision. Amazon offers all the streaming services while syncing with my Prime account while the other options have shortcomings in the content availablility. This is a must-have for any Prime member. Also, check out SideClick's universal Fire remote attachment if you'd like to avoid having to use multiple remotes."
"2349","So far I have not been thrilled with it.  It appears you have to subscribe if you want access to anything and pay for it.  I did sign up for the Amazon free trial but they do not appear to have that much that is free (or at least that I have found).  The reason I think it is not good for me is I only watch TV channels and I watch very little of that.  I do like to record stuff and, of course, you can't do that.  I just don't feel like I need all that it offers.I am giving it a chance and would appreciate any input that might change my mind."
"2350","Works great!  Voice activation makes it easy for my little guy to find the shows he wants to watch.  Just a note to anyone who's upgrading from their first-gen stick... make sure to use the new plug adapter with the new stick. I thought it would be nice and easy to just use the same plug the first one used, since I already had it threaded through the hole in the entertainment unit, but discovered that the old one doesn't deliver enough power to the new stick, and the new stick just kept rebooting spontaneously. Swapped out the plug, and it works great."
"2351","I love it when it works...constantly getting frozen pictures while the sound continues.  Sometimes, not even that!  Some days shows buffer all the time with no sound.  It seems the major problem is in using DirectTV NOW.  I bought Fire TV specifically for DirectTV NOW.  Very frustrating.  I've tried all the fixes.  I've deleted cache, restarted the router, restarted the modem, restarted the modem AND router, restarted Amazon Fire TV, restarted DirectTV NOW, etc  Today, no problems at all!  Someone...Amazon or DirectTV NOW really need to look into this!"
"2352","I am really enjoying watching TV now.  With so many shows and movies to choose from, I think of what I want to watch, tell Alexa to search, and she does the searching for me. I am still exploring what all I can do with my device, but I am sure I will be pleased."
"2353","I waited to purchase the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote vs the older version without remote.  I think it was worth the wait.  The Fire TV stick is doing well so far.  Having Amazon Prime with this product is a good idea, you get much more!  I like that you can take it to a friends house and enjoy a movie in this way also.  I haven't yet figured out how to view the regular channels 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 as for live news as of yet though.  If anyone can let me know how that works please do explain.  I think that anyone who purchases the Fire TV stick will enjoy it!"
"2354","I feel it was a bit of a waste of money. I think the Apple TV works better and is easier to navigate. I thought there would be a lot of free movies, there aren't. It has the same apps as AppleTV. The Alexa voice search and being able to (most of the time) control it from your phone are cool. Bottom line if you already have an AppleTV or something similar you don't need this, there are very few free movies you're missing out on."
"2355","My smart TV got zapped by lightning so I was looking for an affordable way to access Netflix and Prime Videos on its non-smart replacement. I'm very happy with this device. It works great!"
"2356","Alexa and I are bonding quite nicely. She is proving quite useful in my quest for more lazy days. The parental control feature is nice. And I can now find out the weather each morning without having to flip channels.  Overall, I only mostly love the Fire Stick. It must be because the power cord points awkwardly upward on my LG tv. The lack of an Ethernet connection does kinda bum me out.  But the HDMI extender is a cool addition; keeping this stick at a solid 4 stars."
"2357","A must for any prime members. Set is a blink of an eye and the voice Search is great.If you add the fire stick app to your phone and you a great remote.You can plug it in any HMDI and you have your personal fire TV."
"2358","I love this thing. It took me a while to start to use it, but once I did I fell in love! If you misplace your remote ( cause I always do) you can download a remote to your iphone and ipda!"
"2359","Could not have been easier to install and it's so much nicer viewing movies on my TV instead of my Apple 5S iphone!  Thank you Amazon for your support, which, it turned out, was not necessary."
"2360","This Fire stick is an upgrade to my former tv stick which still works. But I had to get this because there was a price reduction and I was intrigued with the Alexa function. I love Alexa!!"
"2361","I'm not sure how we watched tv without the firestick! It works right out of the box and is easy to set up with Amazon and Netflix.  Works so much better than what came with the television."
"2362","Since I'm not good with any technical stuff, I was amazed how easily the Fire Stick installed and works.  The voice feature is awesome.  Just say what you want to watch and there it is!  I ended my long association with cable and plan to install a few more fire sticks.  I did not have to have the grandkids do it for me.  Give it a try!"
"2363","I purchases this after a lot of research after getting fed up of paying so much to Dish. This was definitely worth it and now my bill is half of what I was paying to Dish. So glad I purchased this and it is better than Dish because I have everything in one place, international channels, local and everything else. If you are thinking about getting Sling TV and ditching cable/dish, this is it."
"2364","I had made this purchase to give me channel options for a non connected t.v., for such things as Netflix, etc....Having Alexa access to all of my smarthome from the remote is an added bonus!one of the best purchases to date!"
"2365","I love the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote.  It was easy to install.  My TV is 2009 so it doesn't come with the Amazon Prime app.  I taught my seven year old how to use it in minutes.  The picture clarity and the sound is better than Cable TV.  You have to be careful with children because there are many programs on Amazon Prime that require payment so you have to put some children controls on it or they'll inadvertantly run up your bill."
"2366","Easy to set up and get started.  Able to set up a tv in an extra room to view net Flix or amazon without cable."
"2367","After trying to hook this up for a long time, I had to call a rep to help.Completely helpful, we realized the product was defective. He told me one would ship out soon, and I had to send the old one back. Figured it would be a week before I got this, shopping mine then waiting for theirs. The next morning one was on my doorstep. It included a stamped envie to return mine in. Setting this one up was a breeze. Absolutely love it, and LOVE the customer service"
"2368","It is great buy. I recently turn off my cable and you access everything through fire stick.  If you are amazon prime member. You have access to watch a lot of movies. I will buy another one."
"2369","So far so good, although I'm waiting for a wi-fi extender to arrive to get full value, as we spend a lot of time buffering and re-engaging the internet at this point. That was expected, though. If anything, it's performing better than I expected it would without the extender."
"2370","""Alexa launch YouTube"". Great! It works""Alexa search music video"". No.. Not in the amazon search option, in youtube.""Alexa search YouTube music video"" nooooo wtffff.Fire stick has a perfectly good voice to text option but it's limited to buying things on amazon and not free to use in individual applications."
"2371","I recently bought this at Best Buy, since I could just get it at the store.  I love it! Easy to use and the remote was very user-friendly as well! Our smarttv in the bedroom stopped supporting YouTube, so I needed something else, this has definitely fit the bill and I could also download all my other subscriptions on there as well.  Very happy with my purchase!"
"2372","I love the ability to watch what I want when I want but the remote doesn't work half the time. I've only had it hooked up for a couple of weeks and had to change the batteries twice already."
"2373","I am so glad that I finally decided to purchase this fire stick. The voice commands are a great touch and most of all, I was able to successfully download Kodi onto it. You will not be disappointed when you buy this."
"2374","Disappointing. If you use it as Amazon intends, it is fine. But to be really useful it needs work. Like many similar devices it is unfortunately too dependant on an Internet connection.Sideloading kodi and vlc certainly helps from the playback side.My biggest complaint is the lack of support for ad-hoc wifi or wifi direct.Support for miracast is also not as robust as one might hope.Having the microUSB work with OTG is a plus that Amazon barely acknowledges."
"2375","I had a google chrome cast but didn't like that I couldn't stream Prime movies and shows through the device.  When I saw that this had a voice remote, I had to have it.  I really like the remote.  The device is fine, but the remote is GREAT!  I love using Alexa and not having to try and type titles.My mother who is usually unable to use electronics without constantly calling me for help really enjoys the use of the remote.  Its fool proof and has a great learning curve.It makes a great gift.  I ended up giving mine to my mother, and plan on ordering another!"
"2376","Bought this for Netflix but wound up doing a lot more with it. Only negative is you have to plug it in still. I found an adapter that will plug it in to the USB to lose plug just haven't ordered yet"
"2377","It's ALWAYS cutting in and out... Especially, during pivotal  moments in my FAVORITE shows! If it didn't take a hundred years to get another one, I'd send it back. I like my Roku better. Don't have those problems. Glad I found out about this before I  bought two more."
"2378","Yes!  My niece & nephew gave this to me as a gift and set it up as well.  I am really enjoying it.  Best gift ever.  It will provide hours and hours of entertainment for me and my little grandson."
"2379","After purchasing the fire stick we were able to cut back on cable service. I loved it so much I purchased one for my granddaughter who in in the Marines and does not have access to cable. I would highly recommend this to anyone trying to cut costs. You do however have to be a prime member to view some of the Amazon series."
"2380","This is by far the best streaming device you can buy. I own a Roku 3, which is an excellent device, but this has more features and a better user interface. I purchased a third because I just ""cut the cord"", ditched my cable company and signed  up with Playstation Vue. Couple this with a high speed (100 mbps) and I'm all set. Not only do I watch only the channels I want, I so am a Prime subscriber and get all of the benefits associated with that as well. I will saving about $50 per month and this is with a connection that is twice as fast as what I was paying for before.If you are looking to get a streaming device, I strongly recommend that buy this one."
"2381","This worked very well and has access to all the stuff I need since the Chromecast will not support Amazon!  But honestly I still like the Roku interface better and it includes everything!"
"2382","I have had this for a month or so, and just now realized I can use the alexa feature to control my smart home! I thought the alexa was only to find shows or programs within the firestick!"
"2383","This has completely surpassed my expectations. I bought this thinking ""Oh everyone else has one so I guess its good"" But now I am amazed! Amazon has done it again. I have a Echo and love the ability to control things in my house but now I can control them with this amazing and sleek remote! I made a video review if you would like to see it in action and are not already persuaded! My YouTube channel is TVloger (first on the list when you search it) This is a no brainer for someone who either does not have a smart TV or wants An amazing device!"
"2384","I love this fire stick. It retains my info. If I leave to go somewhere and I have to turn it off; when I come back, It restores where I left off when I look for the same program. Wait time is no faster  than if I looked for a show or movie online. Alexa puts the spelling up on the screen so you can make sure you're looking for the right info. Before it searches. I like the 5x rewind and fast forward function. Took me 5 min. To set up. Definitely worth the money I paid for it...recommended it to my friends;  they got one too....I hear no arguments...."
"2385","this is a great addition to my cable-free home.  We have amazon prime and netflix and this made the perfect place to access them, along with many other options we didn't even know about.  Thanks amazon!"
"2386","Love the fire stick and how it works!!  Highly recommend purchasing this item."
"2387","The remote doesn't work at all, I've only had it for 2.5 months.  I can use my phone, but still it's annoying."
"2388","This was a gift for a prime member. I gave 5 stars because it was very easy to set up and use. Maybe bc I am not a real movie fan I found the free content disappointing in both tv shows and movie selections, perhaps the rotate their content like Netflix."
"2389","They need to work on the WiFi range.  I bought this to go upstairs and it wouldn't connect with my wifi. I have no problem with my iPad, kindle, phone and ps3 connecting to my wifi upstairs.  The fire stick kept losing signal si I had to invest another $30 in a wifi booster just to be able to use this.  If the fix the WiFi range I would give more stars. If you use this right beside your router your stock will work.  If you plan on using this anywhere away from your router plan on purchasing a $30 wifi booster from Walmart online the had the cheapest I could find."
"2390","Works great exactly what I needed it for.  Was a bit thrown off there was a wire that had to be plugged into the wall (they never show the power cord in any of the pics), but that's not really a deal breaker for me.  No issues and very user friendly.  Perfect for the price too because I was not trying to break the bank buying one of those apple tvs."
"2391","I love my Fire TV Stick.  I've been using it for a month now.  I love the fact that I can use the stick as an Echo device to ask Alexa questions and control my Smart Home devices.  I can't believe this device was $40 for all it does.  An excellent value."
"2392","I love her, but she is dangerous. I ordered stuff while watching tv and that can never be a good thing!!"
"2393","Performance is smooth and snappy, but it keeps dropping internet. It makes watching a movie with a guest almost impossible when you have to wait every 30 minutes for it to reconnect to the internet. I've read online a lot of users are having the same problem, and none of my other devices get disconnected when Fire TV stick does. Not cool, Amazon."
"2394","Easy to set up & use. I was using Chromecast before but it would stop & restart or I couldn't find it on the setup at all. Fire stick is so much more user friendly & has all the apps I need"
"2395","I have an older Bose 321 system that does not work with the fire tv stick because of incompatible connections.  I can still use the fire stick but only with the television's speakers which aren't that awesome.  Did not see any mention of this situation when I was reading about the product on the Amazon website. So, now I either live with it as is, upgrade my sound system or do more research for a work around.  Would have liked to know of this before purchase. Otherwise, set up was easy and have watched a few excellent shows already (Night Manager!)."
"2396","I love the new stick! I have the 1st generation as well of which still works great! The only 'thing' is that the new generation stick size didn't work with my TV (Samsung 40"") HDMI port. The new larger casing prevents it from fitting. I happen to have an HDMI extender which came in handy for this. It's working fine. I put up a new TV recently and I didn't try to put the stick in the TV's HDMI. I left in the extender.  Now I need to figure out if the Alexa remote can work with the new Echo Dot that was given to me as a gift. Bravo to this device!"
"2397","This is a great version of the firestick as it provides the users with the ability utilize voice commands over the Alexa System.  Alot of Apps that I use are also combined within the stick itself and it's wifi capabilities are decent for a wireless device.  Overall I'm please with this product and would more than happy to purchase it again in the future.  Keep in mind that the Stick plugs into an HDMI port on the TV and uses a USB for power."
"2398","This is so wonderful I really enjoy it ,it helps me look for everything that I need  from movies to  music. it's the best thing I ever got for Mother's Day. thank you son for my Mother's Day gift."
"2399","Fantastic - sorry that I didn't get this sooner"
"2400","I bought this to replace my original Fire TV Stick as that was slogging. It's great for playing Amazon content and as a supplement to my Apple TV. Major shortcoming is that I need to use another remote to control volume and turn my TV and Receiver on and off. Very silly in this day and age. Haven't done much with Alexa but will play with that and update. Would live to see my Amazon content via my Apple TV but that will probably require Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook to cooperate with each other which would probably revolutionize how we watch and listen to content."
"2401","I'm saving a $100 a month cancelling cable"
"2402","I love Fire TV - this is an easy way to add it to another room without the expense and directly connected to the TV. With Alexa voice remote it's easy to find the shows we want to watch."
"2403","I didn't believe when my friend said how much this can do.  It almost makes cable TV obsolete.  Not entirely sold on the Alexander voice thing.  But everything else is great."
"2404","This is the best if you have Amazon Prime.  The voice remote is way better for navigation. We were using our Wii before we got the Fire Stick and the definition was very low.  Now we have high def.  All good."
"2405","Great product for the low cost of $39.99.  Easy to use and install.  I've 3 of these product installed on all my TV's.  It is great for apps like Amazon, Netflix, etc.  The voice report works really great as well"
"2406","great idea put to use, extremely helpful for people with poor eyesight or shakey hands, no more dealing with trying to punch in a movie title, just speak it and the remote does the work."
"2407","This has got to be the coolest gadget ever! I was amazed how easily I got up and running with my new Amazon Firestick. In less than 5 minutes I had it inboxed and plugged into the back of my Yamaha home theater receiver. I could not believe how well it worked and the amount of free music and movies. And being able to use your voice to control it is amazing. I hardly ever watch cable TV. Definitely the best bang for your buck ever. I highly recommend this totally outrageous gadget."
"2408","My family absolutely loves it!  I would give it more stars if I could!!"
"2409","I love the fire stick, but it was supposed to be delivered on Tuesday. I have a prime membership, obviously, so I counted on it. It was a gift to my daughter and her husband, but it didn't arrive until Wednesday instead, so the surprise was ruined as I had to stake out their house to get it before someone door snatched it.  They live within three miles of a distribution center as well, so it is maddening."
"2410","Works well! I used all pieces/parts of the package including the extension piece and the adapter. I stream from Hulu, Netflix, and Prime and everything works as it should. I don't really rely on Alexa Voice that much because there is oftentimes a breakdown in what I say and what it understands. So, I don't mind manually finding things and using the onscreen keyboard. I mainly use it on one television. I know that it claims to be portable as long as there is wifi but I have yet to use it in that capacity. I'll be sure to update this post, once I do."
"2411","Fairly easy to hook up. Didn't like the power cable to it. But it's ok. Most of people he apps you can download but you need a service provider for. Why would people buy this if they need cable. With smart tv they can get all the apps that fire stick can. Thinking about taking it back. Sat night was watching Vikings and it keep saying cannot get signal. Well I have way more than enough bandwidth it's the firestick that is slow.  The only good thing about it is alexia it's cool just asking for a song or movie.  That's the only reason it gets 2 stars"
"2412","One of the easiest devices out there, was already pre loaded with my Amazon profile, I purchased a Fire TV box a couple years ago, the Fire stick is plug and play as well and is concealed behind the TV. Excellent WiFi connection. Highly recommend."
"2413","This is great for watching movies. Wonderful selections"
"2414","I like it! I wish I didn't have to input my password in every time I get on something though. I tried to change it to just purchases but it doesn't have that option for me. Other wise it's good"
"2415","Once I realized that there is a ring around the large button that controlled accessing the necessary row of keys in order to setups network it was easy.  However, a third-party article helped me with the correct connections to make use of my surround sound system via the amplifier."
"2416","This is a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it."
"2417","Now if the development engineers could produce a ""Fire Fond"" universal remote…  Alexa is one of life’s frills and barely complementary but the accessibility to “formerly” premium programs is worth the very small investment after years of cost avoidance (I never thought it worthwhile to subscribe to the premiums)."
"2418","We are still finding out more of the choices we have. I have told a few of my work associates all about it. A d they are looking forward to ordering one. What we are pulling up makes us wanting to get rid of cable tv."
"2419","Better video quality than the previous generation, sound quality is good, seems to buffer less. Voice activated remote works well, just not as well as seen on TV. Overall, I'd recommend it."
"2420","So far so good, this is a very convenient system to watch my amazon prime video download and listen to music.  I have had no issues with the system at all.  I was surprised at how quick working it was and how responsive the applications within the unit are.  I do have my unit behind my living room tv, and it is not visible to the remote, but so far that has not been a problem.  I do see a decrease in how far away from the tv the remote is compared to my other remotes as far as reliability goes.  but staying within 20ft or so i haven't had any problems."
"2421","I purchased the Fire TV Stick for work, we have a TV in our Lobby that has not been turned on for years; we finally have it on and the Fire TV stick really works - now our visitors and customers are able to view and watch TV!  I highly recommend the Fire TV stick..."
"2422","It's nice,but just a lot of sites to down load,and settings to change.Then some movies won't play the first time,and some movies have poor picture,and it was more to it than I though.Its nice majority of the times,"
"2423","I love the Fire TV! I don't know why I did not buy this long time ago, but it makes the Smart TV experience even smarter. It has every app you can imagine and loads of free content that we love! Good work Amazon!!"
"2424","The fire stick with Alexa was everything that I had hoped for. The quality is great and it is more than what anyone can ask for. I had a small, small issue activating my remote at first; however, I quickly found out that it was as easy as ABC and 123. You can not go wrong with this product. The shipping was extremely fast and the merchandise was delivered in excellent shape. Thanks for this amazing product!! I definitely would recommend it a hundred times over to other customers."
"2425","I give it 4 stars because fire stick needs to be plugged in to an outlet, instead of looped to the TV like chromecast does  (chromecast has USB and HDMI that tucks neatly behind the tv). Fire stick is amazing with voice control and intuitive voice response. It can link to apps that coincide with your local cable company, and you can watch free stuff!!!"
"2426","Got it & very easy to setup, now I have Amazon, Netflix & options to have more. It has taken my non-smart tv & gave it an upgrade, glad I purchased this & bought one for my daughter as well."
"2427","Had to have my son set it up for me. Alexa is amazing, you can ask her anything."
"2428","Best option for hotel use.Bought the new Roku stick for use in hotel. After 3 hotel stays, could not get it to work even with tech support helping. Very complex procedure.Purchased the new Amazon Fire stick and it has worked flawlessly in many hotel stays. Very easy to set up.Highly recommended especially for this purpose and for other streaming/"
"2429","I tried the otg hack, and it worked fine until I added a 3.0 jump drive. The keyboard and ethernet that was added caused no issues.  I think the software only allows for micro sd cards."
"2430","Well worth the cost and I will never buy a dvd player again because of the success I have had with this device. This is my second unit and I plan to buy the next gen when they come out."
"2431","I've enjoyed watching all the movies and programs without commercials very much.  I recommend everyone should have a Fire TV Stick. Just talk to it and it finds what you are looking for"
"2432","As usual AMAZON has device to me in two days - despite the fact that I live on a fairly remote portion of S. ORego coast! Hookup, syncing music, etc all simple & love love love Alexa!!!"
"2433","I have Roku players which are great, thought I would try the Fire Sick as it was on sale at a good price and I am a prime member. I will stick with the Rokus. The main problem is No Access to Vudu. This is the main site to watch your downloaded movies on the internet. My entire library is on there as are most people's. The Roku are also much easier to use. The Fire Stick is basically to use only for Amazon products. Organizing and finding content with the Fire Stick is not easy. Roku is simple to search and organize. So I would have to say I am disappointed in the Fire Stick."
"2434","Bought this to replace an old wii for the bedroom TV (not connected to Cable). I am very happy with this device. I think the picture is sharper than with the old system. It is fairly intuitive to use and so far I have yet to use features other than Amazon video and Netflix. The entire system is small and even with a TV several years old we were up and running without any help from technical support. The operating instructions are very basic, but I am confident any 14 year old could have had this device connected and functioning twice as fast as I did."
"2435","The worst I can say about this device is the delay in shipping.I installed the first one on my bedroom/lounging room system, and it has worked flawlessly.With a bit setup like connecting with my WiFi system, and password entries for Netflix and whatever, it was simple to use.Immediately I regretted not having one for my living room set and ordered another, and it is taking a few weeks to be shipped, so it must be popular."
"2436","It's pretty much everything anyone would want or needs. When my family travels we take it anywhere that has wifi and watch anything. This has become the best tv entailment in our house."
"2437","Where has this been all my life? Cut the cord! Cut the cord! Cut the cord!"
"2438","I was so excited to use this, I've been looking forward to using this instead of apple tv. I followed the directions and got everything hooked up but the remote didn't work, so i switched out the batteries, still didn't work. I went to the store and bought brand new batteries, it definitely doesn't work. I'd really appreciate either a refund or a replacement. I requested a replacement but can no where find how long it will take for it to come in, so... my excitement has dwindled to say the least. Pretty disappointed with what I know of the fire stick now."
"2439","This product was better than expected. It has everything that I need. It is very easy to use and I like having Alex's where I can just tell her what I want to see and she finds it.  Don't know what I did before I got my Fire Stick."
"2440","I love the new  firestick.....however, the Alexa remote is faulty! It rarely works properly if at all. I have downloaded the Amazon fire tv app onto my cell phone, which works fine. Otherwise I would not be able to use the firestick due to the faulty remote that comes with it. I've looked on several forums and watched several YouTube videos on how to fix the Alexa remote all to no avail."
"2441","I have been a little disappointed with both the Fire Stick and the Fire Stick with Alexa.  A short time after having both devices I had trouble with each of them not working/not streaming.  It is very frustrating.  The Tech Support is helpful and each time they offered to send me a new device but it is frustrating when you sit down to watch a movie and you are unable to get it to work.  I do have Kodi on my current device which I paid someone to install and I would most likely have to pay again to have someone download it."
"2442","It works okay but Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote is not compatible with Hulu. I get regular network errors. Also with YouTube it constantly hangs up...buffering. I have two other fire sticks, older models, so I know it's not my tv or connection. I purchased a second Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote to see if maybe I just got a defective device but the one I just received does the same thing. I'm returning it."
"2443","I love the fire stick. The only issue that I have is a limited parental controls setting. It only allows for a pin request for any action instead of giving options for which apps need a pin code approval."
"2444","I just received the Firestick and found it easy to install and amazed at some of the features.  I understand there are many add-ins that are available to enhance the performance but have not gone any further until I know the features already on the device.  So far, very impressed."
"2445","I purchased the Firestick because I enjoy a variety of movies and shows. I already had Netflix and Amazon Prime but there were little added extras with the Firestick and it is portable. The firestick came with good instructions. It also gave me the ability to download additional Applications to download and view other programs. It was easy to install."
"2446","Bought the Fire Stick for my parents for Christmas (2016). I don't personally use it but my dad calls everyday to tell me how great it is. He is continually finding new movies and shows to watch. He loves the voice commands. He was having to scroll before on the device he was using and was limited. Couldn't be happier that they live it so much."
"2447","Received quickly, easy set up! Love the amount of movies and tv shows available. Wish it had live streaming local channels, but heck I can watch it later! Love that I can now cancel my cable."
"2448","The all new Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remoe is more than worth the money I put out, installing it  all on 3 TVs in my home. I already had  Amanzon Prime  and a tech savvy relative advised/assisted me to upgrade my Internet,  pick up Sling Blue and Netflix. I  Happy Feet couldn't stop smiling when I cancelled my cable channels and  turned in my receivers. I'm still learning the pros and cons of these  other apps, however its worth not dealing with the worries of a cable bill that just rose up over  $250  and it wasn't with all of the channels."
"2449","Love the fire stick.  It’s the first time I used it and it was easy to use.  I don’t know why I waited so long to get one.  Best thing is that I can take it on the go or to the kids room!  Love that I can see my pictures on prime photo app."
"2450","Love this device. We had a old roku and recentlyMoved off the grid. We needed anewer device to work with slower speed satellite internet.I'm finally able to stream Netflix series"
"2451","Works great. The Alexa feature is great! Travel and connect with a Verizon Jetpack picks up signal 95% of time as sometime in desolate areas. Nice being able to watch our prime videos."
"2452","Can't write enough good things about it. Don't hesitate to buy it. It does most of what full Fire TV does for a lot less money and size. Perfect portable thing to take while traveling."
"2453","Not too happy all seem to work but the prime of all things.  Could be a router thing but the Roku has no issues with the router.  Even replaced with another and it does the same thing."
"2454","Love this Firestick! I'm not too good at voice navigation...I guess I just need to practice with Alexa but like having app on my phone when I lose the remote. I still can control my tv!"
"2455","Remote stopped working after 7 days. Called Amazon, customer rep was very pleasant and helpful. Unfortunately, because I purchased the Fire TV Stick from Best Buy, I would have to get the exchange from Best Buy. Good deal, until I was informed by Best Buy that the Fire TV Stick was sold out and they had no clue when they would have them in stock nation wide, therefore I was out of options and had to purchase another product. Obviously Fire TV Sticks are selling fast (good thing) but bad regarding retail stores who can't keep them on the shelves."
"2456","The set up was very easy and I like the new features. For example, I press the microphone button and ask for the weather and it pops up on my screen. I can also now play Amazon Music through my TV sound system and use my surround sound. Great upgrade!"
"2457","Works well, especially on non smart tvs."
"2458","I'm cool with it. i have all my apps on one device. i wish there was an on off button and sometimes the screen will go black from inactivity although you are watching a show still. maybe its just me not knowing how to use it fully being that I've had it for about 2 weeks."
"2459","Good Product.  I bought  this for my brother in a nursing home.  For the most part it works well.  The only problem is that they should have made it a little simpler in function as well as give instruction or had an e-manual addressed exclusively for the device. Also although you might get an app that it downloads, the wifi system that you're using might not carry that app such as Directv Now (but there are some other issues with that app).  All-in-all it is a neat device that can expand your TV channels and entertainment.  After about two weeks it began over-heating.  I bought a small $6.00 fan from Walmart which seem to remedy the problem--but this is a wait and see."
"2460","You simply cannot beat the price and value. I am saving over $100 per month by cutting the cable cord. The Fire Stick streams online content seamlessly. There are several services available for live TV: Hulu, Sling, DirectTVNow and Playstation Vue. Vue works best for me because I want NFL Redzone. The only Caveat, is that you need a quality WiFi signal at the TV since the Fire Stick does not have an Ethernet port. For a wired connection (always a better option) get the Fire TV."
"2461","As always amazon delivers with the best budget saving streaming device available !"
"2462","This was super simple to hook up and easy to use! My kids are too young to read and using the voice option to look up thier favorite shows is a lifesaver! They are able to work it on their own! It's a great price and there is a lot of apps and channels to add and watch! We have loved this more than cable tv!"
"2463","Thank you! Works great! I got the DirecTV Now app and now I can watch live TV including cable channels without a high cable bill. Its only $35 a month and it has my Hulu,Pandora and Netflix. Awesome! Fire stick is worth the money!"
"2464","No setup required. Simple installation. Easy to use. Picture quality is excellent. Very pleased."
"2465","A really great way to start weaning yourself off of cable/satellite TV.  You may have some issues connecting it (we have an older Firestick; when this new one would register on our TV we switched the two and everything started connecting properly after that) but by this point I expect tech to be at least a little high-maitenence.  Great price."
"2466","i really like it because it works, unlike my chrome cast which kept buffering every few minutes and sometimes seconds. however some shows that i try to watch through prime have no sound, such as dr who and vikings, but some other shows have sound and i can watch vikings through the hulu app and it has sound there.  that's the reason for only four stars, and because the remote sometimes lags a bit.Edit: my tv is so old that it does not have Dolby digital and that is why only some shows were playing with sound. now that i changed the settings everything has sound now"
"2467","OMG I just love it this is the best thing ever, I had bought just 1 but after I received it I went and ordered another one for my room that's how great the fire stick is just talk to Alexa and she does the rest,"
"2468","Wonderful product! Very easy to set-up and use. Only problem I had was linking my Amazon Prime account. It registered me for a new account and charged me the $105 fee. I got a refund but it's not that clear how to register your existing prime account. I was told if you bought the remote with your prime account it would automatically link but that wasn't the case for me."
"2469","I like the fire stick a lot!! I also have an Apple TV box and I like the way you navigate with it better, but I like the convenience of the fire stick, like being able to take it on trips with me. I get quality HD video with the stick and it is well worth the price I paid for it."
"2470","I love it. I wish that I would have purchased it before now. The control is easy to use. Definitely worth the money. My daughter is special needs and she can operate it with no problems!"
"2471","I am fairly tech-savvy but unfamiliar with video streaming.  It seems that a strong WiFi signal is required in order for the stick to work.  A ""fair"" signal strength was not good enough which required some repositioning of the router.  OK, not a big deal but then I tried to stream some music and no way.  Looked for a solution on Amazon and bupkis.  Seems lots of folks have the same problem with no good answers.  A bit of a disappointment for sure."
"2472","I love my fire stick so much! I now have two in my home and highly recommend them. They are user friendly and without paying for cable I can watch tv and my favorite shows through apps."
"2473","It works great, I'm very happy with this"
"2474","Love it.  It enables me to watch Netflix in another part of the house.  Easy to set up.  Voice remote pretty cool.  I recommend this for anyone who doesn't have a smart tv or cable box for that location."
"2475","Awesome product(s) !! First got the Fire box (awesome) for living room and a Fire TV stick without Alexa (awesome) for den and to take traveling  and, now, the Fire Stick with Alexa (awesome) for bedroom .... couldn't be more pleased and highly recommend!!!"
"2476","Before using the Fire TV Stick we were always having a problem with buffering while trying to watch a movie with Amazon Prime.  Now it works perfectly.  Very little setup.  Easy to use.  Well worth the cost."
"2477","This is my 5th fire stick and almost every television in the house has one .  I've  given away two to family members who just had to have one.  Nonetheless,  I'm completely satisfied with my fire sticks (and one fire TV box).  Between the movies, the Amazon originals and the prime music (not to mention the 3 Kindle fire tablets in the house) there is never a moment that your life could not be entertained.  I love my Amazon fire products."
"2478","What can I say?  The Fire TV Stick is as good as advertised.  Setup was a breeze.  The on-screen prompts made it ready to go in minutes.  I downloaded some apps that were suggested by a friend and my streaming options improved tremendously.  The information is out there if you do a little research.  It Positively Takes Very little effort.  YouTube videos will hold your hand through the complete process.  Ready, SET, Go!  You are welcome."
"2479","We recently got the fire stick and have loved it! I don't know why anyone would still have cable when you can get the fire stick and streaming services at a substantially lower cost. I'd recommend this to anyone!"
"2480","Installation was easy no problem there.  Don't have a problem with WIFI a few years ago I purchase a router with 5 band channels to accommodate all my WIFI needs..  Downloading apps takes time especially if they fall under your cable carrier everything there needs verification codes.  Not a big selection of apps on the Firestick interface for downloads in comparison to Roku.  You have to search for them.  I like the Alexa voice remote easy to handle.  Was able to download Kodi with the Firestick vs Roku.  Good so far still exploring takes time."
"2481","I bought two Fire Stick's one worked perfect, the second stick would turn off after 15 minutes.I called customer service ( Nightmare) for the firestick with the issues spent an hour on the phone with someone in a third world country who did not understand english. I requested to speak with a supervisor who read from a script and had no idea of what she was saying and only understood some english. The next day I returned the Fire Stick to Best Buy hoping to exchange with working stick. They were out of stock. Very disappointing experience!"
"2482","I use this device daily and it has all I need in a slim remote and small footprint"
"2483","I love it! The Fire TV stick makes it easy to access my Prime tv shows and movies. I have an HBO subscription which was free for a week. I can also access my Netflix and Hulu accounts with the Fire stick. It's easy on my budget as I was able to get rid of cable TV. The setup was easy and I can't wait to curl up in my bed and watch tv with my Fire stick. ❤️"
"2484","I travel for work and stay in hotels. Limited channels on the road and used to have to having to drag out the laptop and duel screen. Plug this tiny thing into the wall and tv and BAM. All your netflix, hulu, amazon prime options right there. Easily deals with hotel re-direct pages and gets you access. Hardest thing about it is remembering to grab it before you leave the hotel. Lost one that way and had to buy another. The case they recomend for it is good too. I usually just leave the case splayed open in obvious place now so I remember to grab it."
"2485","I always hate dealing with electronics, it was so easy to install, the hardest thing was opening battery case.  It was everything I hoped for in viewing my prime movies and TV series as well as lots more opportunities."
"2486","I'm not trilled with it.  Everytime I want to see a cluster of movies (i.e. Thin Man, etc.), I see one and then the others keep stopping and starting during the movies.  But since it was a gift, no choice but to keep"
"2487","I have 2 of these now. Never felt the need for cable TV. There's so much to watch on Firestick. You can get subscriptions to just the providers you want without all the others you don't. But I spend most of my time on PBS which is free. Or Amazon shows and videos which are plenty of choice for me."
"2488","This is the second Fire TV Stick I bought.  Now both TVs have one.  Absolutely love how easy it is to set up and how great it works with Amazon Prime Video and also Netflix.  Highly recommend it."
"2489","We love this!  It works great!  The only small problem is if you have a basket of remotes, if one sets on top of this one it'll turn on Amazon and switch off whatever else you had on."
"2490","Best purchase of the year! Thanks Kodi."
"2491","This is in awesome product ! I originally ordered one being a bit skeptical but now have them set up on two TV sets! Makes an older model flat screen into a Smart TV. Great job Amazon"
"2492","Why more people aren't using this is beyond me! We save almost $200 a month by cutting the cord! How you ask? Simple Google and it's as easy as following steps from a Youtube video......."
"2493","works nice have not use that often but works when I need it. i would recommend"
"2494","Best home entertainment investment by far. The ability to stream live TV is so 21st century. I'm able to get work done and not miss my favorite shows and movies. Very family friendly."
"2495","Not quite as fast as the Fire TV, but with the major difference in size, I didn't expect it to do as well as the larger $80 unit.That being said, I use it every day and it does not cause me any trouble. :)"
"2496","I just received my Fire Stick yesterday. It was super easy to set up. Just plug it in and setup begins immediately. Picture quality is good. I watched a movie through Prime last night and did not experience any lag what so ever. Definitely easier and more convenient than having to hook up my laptop every time I want to watch someone online. Great job Amazon!"
"2497","I really like it. I bought a Chrome Cast several years ago and was not impressed with it, so I was skeptical of Fire Stick but bought one anyway to try out DirecTV Now, and it works great. Plus, the remote is awesome. I do hope the Alexa remote will be able to do more things in the future. I thought the Alexa remote would be able to do all the same things the Echo device does. Not so. It can find you TV shows, movies, apps, and give you the weather, which is great, but it won't do much else at this point. Anyway, it works great with my DirecTV Now."
"2498","If the TV is equipped with a HDMI output this product is awesome. Any TV becomes a smart TV without paying big dollars for special features. Runs very smooth and I have access to all my accounts (HBO, Amazon, Netflix, Hulu) all in one place. Of course you need to subscribe and pay for those services on top of buying the fire stick, but thats up to you. Plus the voice remote makes it so much easier instead of clicking each character to search for something."
"2499","Takes a while to figure out how to use this device but once I did, I think it is a very good remote.  I have not even used the Alexa voice part!!  Forgot it was even part of the remote."
"2500","I was hesitant to purchase this item, but I really wanted to ""cut the cable"" and for the price, it was worth a try!  It takes a few minutes to get used to operating the system, but the set up was very simple, it provided step-by-step by instructions, and total set up time took less than 10 minutes.  We installed all of our favorite tv apps (Netflix, hulu, Amazon Streaming, etc.).  We have now officially cut the cord, this have everything you could need and more to watch tv.  We loved it so much that we bought 2 more for the rest of the house."
"2501","fires up, connects to router located well away.  Voice remote is the way to go, otherwise, there's no Search on the Firestick. However, you can get Search on the Firestick App on iPhone."
"2502","Love the fire stick - but the remote kinda sucks.... sometimes it just doesn't work at all or you have to click the same button a few times to get it to work .... but luckily there is a fire stick remote app that you can download and make your iPhone the remote-  and even use Alexa with!"
"2503","This little device amazes me. One can actually find shows by talking to it. The range of streaming applications is very broad. Easy to install and use. Exceeds my expectations and I've been in the technology business for many years."
"2504","Works well. Installed Kodi and opens up new worlds of entertainment. Downside of the stick is it slow to respond with the remote. Very slow. However, the free iPad app helps out a lot. Much better reponse than the remote. I would gladly pay more for solution to the remote lag."
"2505","This is really great as far as seeing movies and movies in theatres now yes that's great but as far as just watching tv no. It's all streaming and it doesn't show what on now live because it's all streaming. That being said you just have to look throw the networked to find your tv shows and if they streamed you will get the latest but overall it's a very good purchase as far as movies. Tv is good as well if it has already streamed so you can see the latest episode of whatever show you watch example married to medicine or housewives of Atlanta."
"2506","Works as advertised. My wife and I got tired of taking our laptop in to the living room and hooking it up to the TV via HDMI. Now we can just sit on our butts and watch TV ;) All in all though, a very solid product and most certainly worth it if you have Amazon Prime, and other services like Netflix, Hulu, or streaming premium channels (we use it with Prime and Netflix).YMMV, but for our purposes and use, Alexa is just like any other voice recognition (Google Assistant, Siri, etc.) software with all the same benefits and drawbacks."
"2507","You'll love it if you only use this. But if you use the Firetv Box first you'll be disappointed in the stick.The speed and storage capability is lacking compared to the box. But that's the price difference I guess. I definitely suggest cancelling cable and going this route. We did it, and couldn't be happier. 250.00 cable bill gone and the ability to watch whatever we want whenever we want. Loving it."
"2508","I works a little better than the Apple TV - my opinion. However it was difficult to connecting to my internet for some reason. It works well now that everything is connected. The Alexa voice does not seem to work within an app. It just gets you to an app. It times out randomly and I have not figure out how to stop this practice but that might be something within the app instead of the device. I wish there was a quick sleep button on it but I have to go through the menu. Overall, it's a good buy and I would recommend it."
"2509","Very simple.  Its input is handled by my Yamaha AVR on one of 5 HDMI inputs.  What I don't like is the identification of ""channels"" that I would have to pay for to receive.  What I do like is the faultless streaming of programs."
"2510","My 4 year old has mastered the firestick. If you have mettered data know this uses high amounts of data. Around 1.8-2.2mbs to run netflix on this vs .9-1.2 on my other tvs native app."
"2511","I wish this stick came out first than Google cast coz with only a few bucks difference this comes with a remote with a voice recognition I love it that I got one for my Aunt too I love being a prime member another great deal for me the only thing is I wish it features more apps to stream on TV like ones I used to have on Google cast xp"
"2512","Wow! I feel like I have been living in the dark age until I purchased this lovely gadget! I had a bit of trouble with Alexa hearing me through my out of date TV. So I downloaded the APP on my iphone and now all is perfect! The iPhone acts as an additional remote!"
"2513","This was incredibly easy to set-up (and I am not good with electronics/technology), and works exactly as described. I have a smart tv that's a few years old and the internet connectivity had been going in and out, the Fire Stick fixed all the issues I was having, and it is also way more user-friendly than the tv was. I honestly didn't have high hopes/expectations for the Alexa voice control since my Siri never seems to get anything right- but the Alexa is awesome and always understands what I am saying. I just wish I would have bought this sooner!"
"2514","I love it everything about it is awesome I had to YouTube some things to figure out how to upload stuff but it's fantastic I recommend this to anyone😄❤️"
"2515","It took me a long time to decide and use my fire stick after receiving it in the mail. I just connected it yesterday. Super easy to connect and the set up was a snap! Any accounts you have with any apps all you have to do is send them down from the cloud and sign in. I had no idea how much I enjoy my fire stick. I'm considering cutting the cable cord too!"
"2516","A nice item to have for your wifi connection."
"2517","I've only had it for less than a week, but it works really well. I bought it because I've been wanting to tell my cable company to 'take a hike' (or a 'flying leap') I was able to get free trails with Fling, Hulu and Netflick....Amazon Prime also offered me a free one-month trail but I didn't opt for it.. I've been watching movies and shows on Fling, Hulu and Netflick through my new Fire Stick for the last few nights and the quality has been excellent. Granted, I have super fast Internet so I have no problems with streaming. Overall, I think this device is awesome."
"2518","I wouldn't have given it a thought if I wasn't told by someone who is not tech savy how good and easy it was to use. I took the chance and bought 2 (one for me and one for my daughter). Have only had it for 3 weeks. Showed daughter how to set up and a few days later and 2000 miles she had no trouble converting her TV to a smart TV. Great device and well made. Only concern is how long the remote will last based on other digital devices made in China (answering machines) with the same mechanical technology. For the price, it was worth the risk."
"2519","Of course the real details of this product was not revealed until I purchased and loaded on my TV. If, my provider is not on the list to have channels like, HGTV, TNT, CBS and others that are not costly, then I am not able to get those channels. The free channels show the same stuff, over and over. It is not what I expected. It may be different if that was all I had to work with, but I do have a provider for my main TV and my mother's room. I opted to use the Fire stick to curb some cost. It has not worked good for me."
"2520","OMGOODNESS! I put that in all caps for a reason. The amazon fire TV stick with Alexa Voice is AMAZING! Every since I decided to make the switch, I haven't regret it. Do yourself a favor and cut the CORDS from your cable provider. All the convincing in the world couldn't stop me from making the best decision to $ave money frim thise blood suckers...AT&T, Comcast Xfinity and all the rest. Premium programming all for $40 bucks. Thank you Amazon for providing us with best options for less. I've saved $400 this month alone."
"2521","Ingenious product! Easy set up and navigation features. The voice activates Alexa remote works great and is a real convenience. One product upgrade I recommend is that next gen remote have an illuminated key pad to operate in a dark room when watching a movie or TV show. Other than that, I give it 5 Stars!"
"2522","It was easy to install, but not so user friendly navigating through some of the apps. Also, if you don't have enough speed with your wireless connection you will be very frustrated trying to watch anything from it. Other than that you can pretty much access anything from the fire stick."
"2523","Older kids got for Christmas. I'm giving it five stars as I love the fire stick. However, the voice remote can be a bit picky at times and for the most part the kids do not use this feature. Even without using the feature of voice control kids have no problems navigating the fire stick."
"2524","I'm loving my Firestick so far, and so are the kids.  My only complaint so far is the remote is so small that I can see us losing it in no time, also I wish it had power and volume controlls for the t.v..  I need 3 more so I can cut cable, but Amazon is limiting me to 1 week.  I wish I could just buy what I need now."
"2525","I like the firestick but I couldn’t get any news channels.  I had to order sling television so I could get the sports and news channels.  On my firestick it’s nothing but movies and I don’t watch movies all the time.  But I like the firestick."
"2526","Was skeptical about the performance of one of these versus the the regular FireTV. This has exceeded my expectations. Very fast and easy to use with many features. Buffering 1080P happens instantly compared to our TV's built in steaming apps which takes ages for the quality to clean up. I can only wonder how the FireTV surpasses this device."
"2527","I actually enjoying the voice search.  I can get the local weather Simply By using the voice search. As well as Listening to my music from Amazon Prime or search for a specific song.  This is a great Improvement thank you Amazon!"
"2528","Awesome, arrived earlier than expected and Amazon's packaging is always excellent. Great product, the only complaint I have is the low supply however, I understand because of the high demand!!!"
"2529","We have Fire TV and now for the other TV we have the stick we just love them both use all the time and don't have to keep undoing the tv so we can plug it into the other one . Thanks"
"2530","most of contents you gotta pay to see .. monthly . so don't expect  too much . and also depends on your internet connection the video quality is up and down .  i don't recommend any 1 with slow internet."
"2531","Amazon Fire Stick with Alexa has been great. Only issue is that I have tried use the FS1 app and I am still blocked because my ISP does not include it with the package I have. I would have thought by what I read about this that all would be included. I could have upped my Internet package and then used Chromecast for that. I want to watch NHRA Drag Racing on the channel and that is the big reason I purchased the Fire Stick. I am learning how this all works. All in all with having Prime there are a ton of great benefits and way cheaper that cable or satellite."
"2532","This is the best streaming media player in the 1080p category.  It's fast,  easy and very portable. It even allows sideloading apps so it never feels locked down like other boxes.  It feels very fast as far as loading Netflix,  Hulu etc.  Video plays almost immediately without buffering for the most part.  The ui is very intuitive and oddly the only I found confusing at first was finding my Amazon Prime content. It's mixed into the menu instead of using an app icon.  I would prefer to see an app icon along with the current integration model."
"2533","I am disappointed. I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. We had just bought the FireTv, so we thought it would be a nice gift she could watch in our home, just on her own Tv. Well, she has not even had it a month can not use the Alexa remote because it just stopped working. Like relaced the batteries and tried some sync thing my husband tried.) I am forced to buy a replacement remote (which is half the cost of the actual stick itself...) This product should work better. Or at least offer a replacement under a warranty or something."
"2534","This latest iteration of the Fire TV stick is just plain --- right, awesome. It is definitely faster than the previous generation, but the biggest difference for me is the addition of Alexa and voice recognition. You can't go wrong with these bad boys. You are getting a lot for the asking price. Of course, if you want better gaming performance you'd have to step up to the Fire TV box, but the Fire Stick IMO gives the best bang for the buck. It's no wonder they're out of stock here at amazon - they're perfect  stocking stuffers. Kudos Amazon!"
"2535","Amazon Music still crashes. The wifi is weak. I had to reconfigure a router to be a repeater in order to get a stable watching experience. All my other devices have no issues playing HD media, but this device did. I will admit that this device IS on the other side of the house from our modem, but like I said, no other tablet or PC in the house has issues playing high definition media from this range. So if you have to use this device over 40ish feet through walls, chances are you'll need to have a repeater to get a stable viewing experience."
"2536","The fire stick is tremendous tool some of the add-ons hurtle difficult to install but you have to read the instructions on the Internet the fire stick is fabulous I recommend it for anyone"
"2537","It would probably work a lot better if it didn't depend on internet service. I live in a rural area and the only internet service I can get is with a satellite dish. A drop of rain or a dark cloud will knock out my service. Also, it is very slow so the program I want to watch has a lot of buffering and I am limited on my service. Two or three movies will wipe out my allotted time for the month. I have eight months to go on this contract with HughesNet. Hopefully by then I can find a better service with unlimited time."
"2538","I got this to see if I could stream prime faster than with my smart TV. The tv would be slow due to ""bandwidth issues"".  With the fire stick in that tv, no change in network everything works perfectly! I'd give it 5 stars except I'd thought it worked off tv usb port. It uses an HDMI so I needed to buy a splitter switch to use firestick and PS3.  It does clearly say hdmi but I'm so stuck on a ""stick"" being usb tech I had a mental block.  Anyway, works great to boost streaming speeds even with smart TVs!"
"2539","stick itself worked good.  i had to replace batteries in the remote every couple months.  wayyyyy to much in my opinion.  amazon just said reset to factory default on remote.  now its every 3 months."
"2540","Really a awesome item of its time. The downside, you have to go thru every network separately to register an watch live local networks. I have Xinity an have the provider but to sign up, the process is daunting if not vauge. Another is no Vudu, shame. Yes I understand, I have the amazon  prime but Im not throwin my collections away!? Referal and word of mouth is why I bought it, offer both and you will great sales at all times. Im always lookin for great movie deals!This is a great product, but do your homework."
"2541","I ordered two of these, one for each TV! I love it!  So glad I finally cut that cable cord! Best thing I ever did! I also got one as a gift...what I didn't like is all my personal information was on the stick when they hooked it up!  What's up with that? They had my name, account information etc...  Please be careful if ordering for someone else!"
"2542","Yes and I'm still just finding my way around all the shows and I do like that everything that I already have with my Amazon is already to go.I  will order again"
"2543","Just bought a fire tv stick for my home as a trial to make a decision whether to get rid of my Fios TV which is running me a fortune between equipment rental and service and we really watch only a subset of channels.. so I subscribed to Directtv now and I already subscribe to netflix, hulu and CBS All access. I also have the medium level internet service and with it so far no issues. I should note that I have a mesh wireless router system in my home which probably enables this to work well also."
"2544","Don't buy this if you want to access your UltraViolet Digital Movie Collection.  No VuDu or Flixster app.  DisneyMoviesAnywhere does work. (Disney, Marvel (but not X-men), and Star Wars)Also had some trouble navigating a hotel's wifi 'sign-up' page.  Field Selection wouldn't highlight anything, cursor mode wouldn't move down once the page started to scroll.  By moving the cursor over into the area and then switching back to field selection mode, I was finally able to accept the wifi."
"2545","I love this product!  Easy to use and setup!"
"2546","I love the Fire Stick and bought it as a gift for someone. I didn't like that the fire stick I bought as a gift came with my Amazon account information on it- not a great idea for a gift when the stick gives the option to link to your credit card. Be sure the gift receiver knows to not use the giver's account information without permission."
"2547","Loving the heck out of this so far. Easy install and setup, very user intuitive."
"2548","I had been using a PS3 to stream TV in our living room. I had to get surgery and knowing that I would be in my bedroom recovering I put a TV in there. So, I purchased the Amazon Fire stick to stream TV in my room. I love it! It has all the apps I need and it's so much easier to use than the PS3. I feel like the shows are even more HD. I convinced my mom to ditch cable and get an Amazon fire stick!!!"
"2549","Bought this for a TV for a spare bedroom.  It loads very quickly, a lot faster than the apps on my Vizio TV.  The size fits well behind my TV.  It is extremely easy to change networks which will make it a good travel companion when staying at hotels/motels.  I was not able to easily change the network with my chromecast.  So far I am very happy with the fire tv stick."
"2550","I like the Fire TV Stick a lot. I wish there was a light on the remote to let you know that it's doing something. I can't complain because it does what it's supposed to do. Great product!"
"2551"," The new Fire TV Stick comes with a quad core processor, 802.11AC Wireless, and new Alexa voice remote. The new processor helps tremendously with navigation and streaming. I didn't notice any issues with slowness. The voice remote works well and allows you to search for specific music and videos.PROS:PriceInconspicuousOpen for installing third-party appsComes with Voice RemoteFireTV Smartphone appCONS:No voice support for Youtube and several other appsAds can't easily be turned off"
"2552","Love it! Enjoy the free apps and a free bit of time in the Prime movies, but the most favorite was to be able to cast my tablet to the television! Good design, easy to set up and use!"
"2553","Works well, is faster than the earlier version, we use mostly for Sling and no problems. Plug it in to the HDMI and the USB on the TV. No external power needed. Haven't tried Alexa."
"2554","It works fine but the voice activated stuff just keeps trying to sell me Amazon content. If I tell it to play a show I know is on Hulu it always tries to sell me the show on amazon."
"2555","We have this and the roku.  I like the roku better because it is easier to navigate the screen.  We were trying to use the firestick to access our cable channels and it's a little annoying."
"2556","I like the variety of things to watch but after two months the device tends to reboot quite often when browsing options to watch.  I was hoping for an update to solve the problem.  Otherwise, I find the device quite useful."
"2557","ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC I am really amazed at what we can do with it. I have bought two more . One for my son and one for my grandson.Dan RodgersAuthor of the best seller CALL ME SERGEANT ROCK"
"2558","My family and I have been cable free for two years now.  We were using Google chomecast.  The direction is excellent,  we are able to save money and watch all the movies including the feature ones.  I love this firebrick that is download with Kodi!"
"2559","It's as advertised. I believe a very valuable fairly priced wireless accessory. It's a bit harder to assemble and operate at first than advertised, especially for technology challenged folks. I suggest they seek the help of someone who has some experience with these nnew installations."
"2560","its a good device and the voice activation works well.  It gives you access to bunch of video services online using just this device.Wireless works great.......so far so good."
"2561","I was surprised by the capabilities, but especially the fun I've had with this piece of technology. It works a lot like any other device that allows you to stream internet, but the Fire TV Stick is still unique. Alexa is a great feature that allows you to speak to your remote. She allows you to search through your collection of video content, open apps that allow you to stream, like Netflix, and you can ask her just about anything. There are some other interesting apps and games you can download. Very easy to set up and works just as quickly as it promises."
"2562","I like it pretty well. My roommate prefers reg cable tv. I can't figure out how to change it back and forth.If I  didn't have to change it back and forth I would like it more."
"2563","This was literally, a ""plug and play"" installation. Setup could not have been easier. The most time consuming part of installation was changing the name on my T.V.'s input source menu from ""HDMI1"" to ""Fire Stick."" Bought a second one for my son, who, after seeing and using mine, was convinced he should convert from Chromecast. The Fire Stick lets you seamlessly stream non-Amazon input sources (Hulu, Netflix, etc.), as well.In addition, Amazon Prime provides an excellent collection of both movies and T.V. shows."
"2564","Received this as a Christmas gift. I already have roku 3 and roku stick. Sticks are something you put in the kids room or buy as a gift. They're slow introductory level.The biggest issue I have is everything is pushed to Amazon content. When you use voice search it only shows Amazon results. Where as the roku search shows results of all movie suppliers and shows prices to see the cheapest movie.The only reason I'd buy the fire stick is to load kodi on it which you can't do on the roku. Otherwise I'd go with the roku."
"2565","Absolutely the best product on the market. I have a smart TV, google chrome cast, and a roku box. This DESTROYS them. The power is ungodly and the abilities are amazing, paired with Alexa?! BAM. I’d give it more stars if I could. Everyone needs this. Even if you don’t, you do."
"2566","Love it. Being a prime member means I can watch lots of movies and no longer drive to the redbox and then have to make a trip the next day to return it. I simply choose the firestick and select a movie and enjoy without travel."
"2567","Works GREAT!!!!!!!! just tell Alexa you favorite actor/actress, movie or movie classification music or musician even the weather!!!!!!  Amazon Prime Video is great, beside the movies, kid content, documentary, music etc, excellent original programing!!!!! Well worth the membersdip plus you cant beat 2 day shipping!!!!!!!!"
"2568","I have had nothing but issues with this thing. For the first week it’d just shut off and restart while I was watching something. After hours of being on the phone with tech support, we finally figured out it was the HDMI extender. So now I can watch it but without the extender, which is fine it just requires me to switch cables frequently.I also have a PlayStation and Apple TV, and I find the fire stick runs significantly slower than its competitors.Overall, I’d say buy an Apple TV. They just work better."
"2569","Works very well! No problems with streaming at all. Just a few slow downs, but nothing compared to the quality you get streaming movies on Sling TV. I got one for my room and one for the living room, and I can watch the shows I want, and my son and his friends can watch what they want. We also have Pandora, Netflix, and YouTube, if we get bored with Sling TV, all on the Firestick.Its working perfect, I really was able to ""cut the cord"" from Comcast. You do use a lot of data though so make sure your data plan is sufficient. Mine is a terabyte, so we are ok.And Alexa will tell you ""good night, sweet dreams"" when you turn it off. It will tell you the weather or find whatever movie you want. Really nice."
"2570","I recently canceled my cable and bought the fire TV stick to replace it. Definitely the best purchase I could have made. It was easy to set up, the interface is super easy to use, and the nice thing is. It keeps you signed into all your accounts and save WiFi passwords. So if your using this in multiple locations, your not having to sign into to everything every time you move tvs. Great to take on trips as well. I never miss any of my favorite shows now. And you Don't have to be an amazon prime member in order to use this device. Though there is so much more you can do as a prime member. Will more likely become a member myself in the near future.  For reference to others who are looking to try this. The apps I use are as follows:NetflixHuluSling TVAnd various other apps like:CBSBravoLifetimeCartoon NetworkFood networkWould recommend this product to friends and family."
"2571","This thing is great. I'm cutting the cable this month.It's about all I watch now.Easy to use and so much content about everything available on it at no charge too with Prime Video."
"2572","Absolutely love the fire stick. Since I purchased it I have not watch anything on cable. The fire stick sometimes freezes up due to connectivity of the internet. This is one of the best things I purchased to date. I can watch almost anything at any time."
"2573","Turns any tv into a smart tv without streaming from another device. Has Hulu Live which is what I needed it for. Speech recognition controls are awesome and easy to use. Will buy more of these for my other small TV's. Not for use on a large 4k tv though."
"2574","The fire stick was very easy to set up, I am having problems with my internet connection when I started streaming.  I have been on the phone with my internet company  multiple times.  But great product."
"2575","I signed up for the diretv now offer with the free Amazon Fire TV Stick, and I'm glad I did. Before getting the Fire Stick, we used a PS4, chromecast, and a very old Sony media player to stream Prime video and Netflix. I was not unhappy with any of the other devices, but I am really impressed with how well the Fire Stick works. It is very intuitive and easy to navigate between and within the different video apps. I left it in the default mode so that it shows all my recent apps when it starts, but I saw that I could set it up to load straight to Directv or Netflix or Prime videos if I eventually decide to just use one of the services.I was also pleasantly surprised to see that I could play my music and audiobooks through the tv. The Fire Stick was a much better choice than an Apple TV for me because I have had a few Kindle Fires and also use Prime music regularly, so all of my media was automatically available once I logged in to my account with the Fire Stick.Another feature I am enjoying is Alexa. I have resisted getting an Echo because I don't like my devices to be always listening, but the Fire Stick only listens when you press and hold the microphone button on the remote, which is how I have Siri set up on my iPhone, too. It's convenient to use the remote to ask about the weather, the news, or to play music.A final note for anyone trying the new directv now service: it works MUCH better with the Fire Stick! The service was painfully laggy on our other devices and computers until we got our Fire Stick set up. It is surprising how much better the service works through the Fire Stick compared to streaming directly through a computer."
"2576","I would give this product more stars, but both of my remotes are cheaply made and faulty. It just took me 10 minutes to get my remote to click to the left. On my other remote for my 2nd stick, the buttons get stuck. I can't watch anything if my remotes aren't well made to navigate through apps."
"2577","The Alexa addition makes all the difference: except portability, this fire stick has all the advantages of the Amazon Echo while costing a fraction of the price... in my case, it is even better since the fire stick is connected to my AV receiver and the resulting sound quality is awesome. In the previous version (without Alexa), it wasn't practical to play music. Now, you just ask Alexa to play Christmas jazz music for instance, and here you are with a wonderful choice of music played at high quality sound (7.1 surround system). Simply AMAZING. Bravo Amazon."
"2578","It's nicer than the first fire stick I had (which died) but the remote stopped working. Had to take the batteries out and repair the remote... twice. Only had it for about two weeks."
"2579","This is a pretty good product but I was expecting a little more. You can get YouTube for free but everything else you have to pay for. Also you can't link up most websites through airplay like you can with Apple TV."
"2580","Can do quite a lot for as small as it is, I have also the fire tv, and wasn't sure this little thing could do as good a job, but for watching amazon videos or netflix, it's great! Which is all I really wanted it for"
"2581","I bought this Fire Stick initially with some hesitation. But I figured it's just $40 buck and some change. What do I have to loose? This thing is probably the best product I have ever purchased online. I plan to cancel my cable bill within the month. Great productSide note: you must add on the Kodi launcher to get added movies and channels"
"2582","I am impressed.  I have been using roku for a couple years now.  Thinking of cutting the cord (or Directv) as they are all becoming to greedy.  When I learned you can load Kodi easily, I ordered one to try it out.  Works great out of the box with things like Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.  Extremely easy to load Kodi Media player on it, and easy to add 3rd party services to kodi that allow one to stream just about anything.  Works nice, smooth, and easy to use.  Probably will buy one for each TV soon and get rid of the $130+ tv service!"
"2583","Superb product for the money.  If you do not need to game with your Fire TV, this is the best choice for the money.  It is slower than the full sized Fire TV and has to buffer data occasionally, but not enough to really matter.  This is very portable so it makes it easy to take it with you while traveling.  Highly recommended."
"2584","Works waaaaay better than the Chromecast, at least in my house."
"2585","This has to be one of the best things I've bought in a long time. I don't have cable box in my bedroom but this sure does come in handy when I just want to watch something for me (I'm in a house full of boys). Connects to wifi great, even with router being on another floor. J would recommend this product to anyone."
"2586","Since they let Alexa (echo dot) control this thing it now deserves a 5 star ratting. The remote that comes with it is a pain to use and hogs Alexa for other uses while watching tv."
"2587","This was easy to set up and then some. I am enjoying streaming Amazon Video to my tv, which I couldn't do with my Apple TV. It has already paid for itself with what we have viewed!"
"2588","Pretty powerful for the price, and very stable on most of my streaming apps. (Beware DirecTVnow app, a disaster). Quick easy setup, terrific interface with amazon prime. Approved!!"
"2589","Delivered on time and easy set up they did not tell you about poor reception behind the tv or possible problem with power supply found out the hard way, not all tvs have USB ports!"
"2590","This is a great product, takes a little time to figure out all that can be done with htis and how best to accomplish tasks, but getting used to using the voice command and love it."
"2591","After getting it set up I have enjoyed it it's not plug and play and  instructions are not very helpful YouTube has a lot of videos that will help you get it set up though the voice  Remote does not prove to be an asset I have not found much that it has to offer over a smart TV or the PlayStation hooked up to the TV do you have either one of these I don't think you need to waste your money on this customer support on setting that up good luck with that"
"2592","First of all, I've had a roku stick for over a year, and added the fire tv stick for a couple reasons--I wanted kodi on my TV, not just my laptop, and I love tcm, and roku doesn't have an app for it.  As an extra bonus, I can access all my prime music.  So far, I've had absolutely no buffering problems.  I worried that I had to use a switch to connect it and my Blu-ray player, but it worked fine.  Easy setup..as soon as I put in my Internet code, it 'knew' who I was and loaded my prime content.  Haven't used the voice commands yet.  Kodi runs as well as on a computer.  Very pleased."
"2593","Love it - works great, even if I don't choose the hdmi with the stick inserted. All we have to do is ask Alexa for the show we want to watch, and it comes up! Enjoy the ability to ask Alexa to backup 30 seconds or 2 minutes, if we missed something! Wish I had these years ago!"
"2594","in fact my 1st Fire stick slowly died over time. Spoke with Amazon support and after some trouble-shooting with no luck, they said I'd have purchase a new one, but here's where the story has a happy ending - they gave me a $25 credit to apply, so it was only like $14 bucks or something.Amazon - how I love thee ;) New one works like a charm!"
"2595","My life is changed! Love this so much am kicking myself for waiting so long now! I'm a Beach Body on Demand user and this makes it so much easier than trying to see a little computer screen or stream over the internet. ""Alexa play Beach Body on Demand"" ""Play Octonauts"" I even downloaded an app for my daughter and I to learn Spanish! It really is as easy as it seems."
"2596","Love it ! Works great on out internet. Have watched several prime moves. Is worth the price of Prime just so you can use the fire stick alone. Of course the free two day shipping is great also."
"2597","Why didn't I order this sooner?! I've had a prime membership for well over a year and never took advantage of the free movies until I got my firestick. Super easy to setup and use!"
"2598","This is such an easy way to view movies from HBO, Starz etc as well as Netflix and Amazon Prime. There are so many movies available. When there's nothing on regular TV, I use my Fire!"
"2599","Very happy purchase, in comparison to Apple TV (4th), $40 vs $150.Setup is simple; you sign-up with your Amazon account. If you have Prime, you can use Prime features. If not, Kodi is worth the investment.Search for and watch YouTube videos on how to get Kodi (with TV addons) on your Fire Stick and you should be set for some pleasant surprises. For the money, I don't know of anything that beats this. Add to all of this Alexa and you have yourself a mini Apple TV (except that it's just better and more practical). On the other hand, if you are heavily invested in the Apple Eco-system and you don't need Kodi, perhaps your better off getting an Apple TV.All-New Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player"
"2600","This fire stick is great. I have a smart tv and can't seem to work my Netflix or You Tube on it, but with the fire stick this isn't a problem anymore.Easy enough even for me."
"2601","I bought this Fire Stick to replace an old Roku stick.  I really like the interface and how all the apps and categories are set up. The only downside I have experienced with this is it will freeze up every once in a while. Simply getting out of the app and back in it will fix it and replay from where I left off but it is annoying that this brand new stick has some bugs or something in it.I would still recommend this if there were an update that fixed the bugs."
"2602","The web page suggested that I might need a small cable to complete the installation of the Amazon TV Fire Stick.  The web page did not tell me what was included with the Amazon TV Fire stick order. Why not?  So, I ordered the suggested additional cable and when the TV Fire stick arrived it already contained a short cable.  It would have been helpful if I knew exactly what was in the Amazon TV Fire stick shipment.  So you will probably be getting the additional cable back."
"2603","I purchased the Fire TV Stick for an HDTV without smart capability or a cable set-top box. I like being able to watch videos on my Amazon Prime watchlist. However, it's kind of amusing that Alexa doesn't understand what ""watchlist"" is. I can't always recall all the selections on my watchlist, so I've tried accessing it verbally. Obviously, that's not going to work. Regardless, the Fire TV Stick works fine for my purposes on that TV and was easy to set up wirelessly. I'm considering purchasing Fire TV for each of my 2 smart 4K TVs."
"2604","I wrote a glowing review before I used the ""All New"" Firestick. I hope that the batteries are bad, even tho they should be fresh but the main button only works half the time. I have to push it several times to get it to work. The other buttons work most of the time but sometimes those are slow to respond. I have 3 of the older  Fire sticks and have never had a problem. I ordered 2 more for giving as Christmas gifts and now I'm sure if that is such a good idea without first testing them. What did they do to them? It didn't improve a thing. Bummer"
"2605","We love the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice remote.  We did not give it a 5 stars because of the difficulty opening the Alexa Voice remote to insert the batteries.  We actually had to find something to fit into the very small slit to force it open.  This should have not need to be so difficult."
"2606","This product is easy to use and is my favorite streaming apparatus out of the three different ones I own.  It is portable so I can switch the TVs I use this with ease.  You do need to plug the stick into an outlet in addition to a TV as there is a cord that goes from the stick to an electrical outlet.The only gripe is related to the initial removal of the battery cover.  I had to watch online videos to determine the best way to do this without breaking the remote (they recommend a rubber glove, which worked - i.e. kitchen glove)."
"2607","Awesome easy to connect comes with everything needed to start using it. Just add Wi-Fi connection. Amazon prime account is a plus too however not needed.Firepad acts like a remote too."
"2608","My parents have been watching Netflix on their Wii for years, well, that Wii finally quit working. The video quality on it was awful so I got this for them so they could watch their shows more conveniently. They love it! I was so easy to set up and so easy to use. Even for people who aren't good with technology. They don't use most of the features, but if they wanted to use them it would be pretty easy. This was the best gift I could have gotten them for sure. They love that they can use the voice control instead of trying to type things out to search."
"2609","Best purchase of Xmas 2016.Set up could not be any easier, it literally  took more time and WAS more difficult to get the back off the remote than hook up and install the firestick.User friendly?  You betcha!Comes preinstalled w various apps, Amazon, prime video, Netflix, youtube, sling, HBO, Hulu...etc etc.What sets the Amazon Firestick and TV apart from other similar products like apple tv, is Amazons own recognition of the value in providing consumers a product they want, and here, is only one of several ways, and the most significant way Firestick is absolutely superior to Apple TV. Customers who expect full control of their home entertainment expect to have the ability to  customize their own TV viewing habitsEnter amazon.  W the firestick, running on the android platform, downloading an apk file is as easy as downloading an app to your cell, it is very easy to customize the look and feel w different skins, installing Kodi takes under 10 min. Depending on your internet speed opens up countless apps for streaming possibilities from radio streams, podcasts, to recipes and alot more, there are tons of how to tutorials readily available on youtube, to walk you thru adding kodi step by step, which is no harder to do than typing a web address and downloading a song or pdf file etc....its really very easy to do, ecsp. W the tutorial videos .Really LOVE getting youtube on the Tv without burning the cell battery up casting, my grandaughter watches alot of cartoons on my cell or casts from cell to the tv killing my batter constantly!  YAY ME!Very happy to have finally splurged buying myself a gift lol and now have it installed, customized and working flawlessly.THANKS AMAZON!  GREAT PRODUCT. GREAT PRICE POINT.  GREAT BUY.  WILL BE BUYING A 2ND FOR GDs BR, and probably a cpl more as birthday gifts over the next couple of months!"
"2610","I love it, only $40 and you get a lot, it screams I have...had chromecast and Samsung wifi direct and a pigfly desktop  tv box...was no 1 rated......threw em all out..have bought 2 more fireworks...way faster no lags...has Sling and Directv Now built in..I've cancelled my $160 cable bill...momma's at home got her a $8 burner...no more. $35 package direct tv now is all we need...I highly recommend amazon firesticks"
"2611","Easy to set up and I got to use my Prime movies and of course the first movie we watched my husband picked out a Stephen Segal moviebut it was just so great to see the options of action, comedy, drama, that is available on prime!!  So Glad to be a Prime member!"
"2612","Very impressive product for the money.  Worked exactly as advertised right out of the box.  The voice remote takes a little getting use to, but I think it wont take long to master."
"2613","Great alternative! You choose your stations and easy to use.  Our wifi is not fast enough...the amount of buffering is awful. I have some more research to do on this-not giving up on it yet.."
"2614","Absolutely can not live without our fire sticks! We have cut the cord to our cable and gone completely digital! I have no regrets and save nearly $2,000 a year by doing so! I will never use satellite or cable services again!"
"2615","Easy to useWhen using the Amazon musicThe text is not showing up( The words of the song)It words do show n my old Amazon fire stickHow do I fix this issue?"
"2616","Works perfectly. My 42"" can stream Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime with ease. Very happy with the Alexa feature as well. Super fast shipping, careful packaging. Great purchase."
"2617","I haven't had that much time to spend with it but so far it's great. There appears there are numerous apps that I can add to this and that will take time to sort out but I love it"
"2618","Wow, there really is so much to watch and do with these fire sticks. I love the I-heart radio app. Turns my Flat screen and the sound bar into more than I thought it would be. Great deal."
"2619","I live in Mexico and English channels are limited. The Fire Stick has given me so many choices! All of the Ken Burns series on PBS were some of the first programs I watched; The Dust Bowl, The West, National Parks, etc. Fabulous shows - I got to watch at my convenience and even pause for breaks to the kitchen. The best of all - NO COMMERCIALS!!  Whoo Hoo! I am loving it!  Thank you for an amazing product. Nova, Movies, Series of your choice (too many!) children's programming, documentaries galore, music and much more.  Thank you AMAZON!!"
"2620","After a month of using this I love it.  Bought it to replace my old roku 2 box that was constantly lagging.  So far the content on here is endless with my amazon prime account and netflix.  The remote is good, a little hard to voice search netflix but it could just be operator error.  I put this stick in the same tv that the roku was in and it hasnt lagged once while binge watching netflix all day long.  Actually just bought another one for my basement i like it so much.  Only con would be i cant use my amazon dot to control this device."
"2621","Overall, this is a great streaming device. However, it constantly loses the WiFi connection just one room away from my Extreme router. I had to make some adjustments to get it to stay online, and I'll see how that goes with time. Though compared to other streaming devices I had the chance to try out, this one is by far a favorite. Very simple to operate, and I can download a number of apps that aren't available on units that cost 2-3x as much. Definitely worth the price."
"2622","still learning how to use, and there are a few issues with buffering - but really enjoy this option for watching TV and ""binge"" watching favorite series.  Definitely worth the cost...."
"2623","I bought this on a whim since I already had an older Fire Stick as well as the Amazon Echo.  However, I love it.  The Alexa voice remote is fun.  It does essentially everything the Echo does and it shows your answers on the TV as well as giving them to you verbally.  Of course, your TV has to be on and you have to be on the Amazon input rather than cable, Dish, etc.  If you want to try Alexa and don't want to spend the money for the Echo, this is a lower cost way to give it a try, especially if you don't already have Fire TV or a Fire stick."
"2624","When I finally decided to purchase the Fire Stick TV it was back ordered for close to a month. I was very excited when it arrived. I connected the included HDMI extension cable, the USB power, then plugged it into the back of my television and it worked perfectly. I ran through the setup and was able to watch my Sling TV television programming within a few minutes. The quality of the stream as well as the UI is fantastic. I would definitely recommend anyone desiring to cut the cord to invest in this little device."
"2625","The one I had gave out but I had it for 3 years.I like the new Alexa voice so far because I don't have to search to type in my movies.  I just use the Alexa voice plus the Fire Tv Stick is a little longer and easier to find in case I misplaced the stick"
"2626","So far I am very pleased! Haven't figured everything out yet but it came with a complete set of ""How-To"" for those of us with minimal electronics savvy!  Awesome!!Bought from a different vendor who did not include anything and was nasty when you asked for assistance. This was a wonderful experience compared to my first try."
"2627","Bought this on Black Friday 2016. I use it every day and it works great for me. I use it more than I thought I would and it works perfectly. The remote got knocked off the table the other day and my dog chewed on it ...a lot.... but it still works great. Looks really bad but still works great. Functions 100%. I would highly recommend it."
"2628","One of the best Amazon products out there, and one of the best purchases I've ever made in my life! Don't waste your money and spend hundreds on Apply TV just buy this. Also goes on sale every once in a while so be on the look out! Bought mine on sale!"
"2629","This helped us get access to Amazon on our tv.  I called them to get help with getting the amazon app on our tv and they were unsuccessful and discounted this purchase by I think $10.  It seemed hard to get the app on our older tv and we didn't want to purchase new tvs or dvd players so I wonder if it should be recommended right away because the process was a pain and I had to spend about an hour on the phone figuring all of it out and we didn't have amazon TV for months because I hadn't had the time to make that call.  However, the device itself is great!"
"2630","I didn't give this a good rating but all it neededwas new batteries to work good. Now, I love it!  The batteries that came with it were old. That caused it to not work good on any feature."
"2631","Handy for prime TV and other tv apps but it is a bit sensitive.  I recommend the service but if it goes out on me completely I would get the box next time instead of the stick I think"
"2632","Bought this for Kodi. Works excellent. No complaints."
"2633","Nope... I hadon't to bring the first one back because the remote wouldn't pair with it... the second one i have to keep switching the batteries back and forth to power it and yes there is new batteries in it...."
"2634","This is one of the neatest things I have purchased in awhile!  I love it and we use it everyday.  It is so easy to install and easy to use.  I love that if you can't find something, you can press the button at the top and ask Alexa.  Now I feel like we are able to get the full benefit of Amazon Prime.  It streams so smoothly and we live in the sticks.  I would recommend this to anyone who would like to stream the music, play games, or movies to their tv bu don't have a way to do it through use of a Wii or another gadget.  Best $30 I spent."
"2635","I was looking for an alternative to cable or satellite television and wanted a way to stream movies and live TV, when I got a tip from a sales assistant to look at the fire stick as a economical alternative. I use the fire stick in my bedroom currently and plan to cancel my satellite TV service at the beginning of the month."
"2636","Love my Fire Stick!  After trying out a few streaming options I finally found the right combo.  The Fire Stick is easy to use and Alexa is often helpful.  Glad I made the decision to cut the cable cord."
"2637","This is the third firestick I have purchased, but the remote does not work. I have paired it several times by holding the home button down for 10 seconds. It works sometimes, but a few minutes later...nothing. I've had to use the remotes for my other firesticks for this one, which is very inconvenient."
"2638","I have used the fire tv stick for direct tv now and netflix and it works flawlessly. I also have the apple tv and I think both products work well. I'll be purchasing another fire tv stick since it costs much less."
"2639","Does not do much out of the box that my smart TV already does. I know that you can ""jailbreak"" it and get access to much more content but piracy really does not interest me."
"2640","Sometimes it doesn't work, and it voice part on it never works.  It doesn't let me cast my screen to the TV, so that's disappointing.  However, it is very easy to access Netflix with this."
"2641","My experience with the Fire TV Stick has been a mixed bag.  For streaming quality and apps I would give it 5 stars.  It streams 1080P content flawlessly.I have one main issue that will probably preclude me from buying another Stick.  My Fire Stick locks up 2 or 3 times a day requiring a restart, the Alexa voice control seems to be the culprit.  75% of the time when I use Alexa, the Fire Stick freezes, becomes unresponsive to any input and requires a restart."
"2642","I think the fire stick is great. Although I haven't used it to its full potential, everything I have done with it is awesome! I really like the voice commands, that way you don't have to type everything you are searching for! Would definitely, and have already recommended this to others!"
"2643","I never knew how convenient the Fire Stick was until my boyfriend decided to buy us one. Instead of switching tabs to go from Netflix to YouTube, the Fire Stick has the apps in one place. Awesome product!"
"2644","Awesome! Amazing! Wish we switched from cable to this year's ago... better late than never. Signal is perfect over Wi-Fi, no issues with signal. Love the non intrusive, firm buttoned remote."
"2645","I don't know what took me so long to get this product ...actually I do know.. I wanted to hear from everyone before I committed.  It's not for cost... it's more for expediency.  I am not tech savvy..don't have a lot of time to fuss with something and I definitely am not the type to package things back up and send it back for a refund...  So after my disastrous attempt with the Chrome Stick ($35 and it would not sync with my tv and wasted an hour of my life and I didn't bother to return it to Best Buy) I took my time, read some reviews and was 80% sure I wanted to buy this product.... I got this product for an incredible price of $29.99 within 3 days.  I lucked out.. I actually clicked on an Amazon email which was very unlike me, I opted for the one-click check out button before I changed my mind... you know how you overthink a purchase... ? yea you do...  Just buy this one.  I would pay more for this product.  It was so easy to install it was ridiculous.  The voice command acuity is so good, it's ridiculous.  It's so affordable it's ridiculous. First class packaging and instructions and it came with batteries! So for tech savvy people, read the tech savvy reviews... there are a lot of them...  I don't know who KODI is but I'm going to explore that when my tech savvy friend comes over.. btw, my tv is far from smart but I'd call it ""slightly unaware"". So my tv was Peter Parker turned Spiderman and the radioactive spider bite was the Amazon Fire TV Stick. So far I've been able to access Amazon Videos, Amazon Music, Netflix/HBOGO/Showtime Anytime/Bravo/AMC/Hulu (subscription required)/ and a bunch of other stuff I have yet to explore.  great product.. seemed to have even improved the tv image... Alexa makes Siri seem mentally challenged. You guys that complain about the connectivity due to wifi, please, get high level wifi... why wouldn't you. No issues for me there as I opt for the most expensive and fastest wifi I can get so that the world is at my fingertips. I've been playing around for a  month.. so far so great and I hope to not retract any part of my enthusiastic review. Thanks a lot Amazon!"
"2646","The Firestick is a wonderful little TV gadget.  It solved the problem of streaming on my TV that my PC was having (Netflix and Prime Video apps lagged annoyingly on my PC).  Only negative thing I can say is I now understand how it got its name.  I really wonder if they have a problem with overheating/burning out.  So far, I would recommend the firestick."
"2647","OMG! This is all you need in place of those astronomical cable bills. Works perfectly once you jail break it and download all of your favorite programs and movies. Bye bye cable."
"2648","This is a great ltitle remote and Firestick!  Very handy as well as for communicating with Alexa.  I haven't used it a lot just yet, but I will and I know it will work perfectly!"
"2649","Have the old manual fire stick and works great. Saved my Amazon prime and Netflix accounts. Installed Kodi 17.4 and it works great too. Using just voice is great and easy to use."
"2650","Very cool and convenient! We had a blu ray player with apps like netflix but it would take forever to load of and when it loaded.No issues so far work the fire stick👍"
"2651","Wow I love my fire stick!  TV is so different now!  Choices are outstanding, easy to use.  One flaw, Alexa doesn't understand my Texas accent very well!  But my British spouse can speak to her just fine!  ughhh"
"2652","The device works well and functions as it should. The Alexa addition is nice. My only complaint about this new fire stick, is that it does not allow you to adjust screen size like the previous version of the fire stick does. It just tells you to change the aspect ratio or zoom setting on your TV's settings. Hopefully a future software update will fix this."
"2653","When Amazon advised us that they were no longer going to ""support"" our smart Visio TV because it is 5 years old, we were unsure what to do. We are Prime members paying for this service and felt there should be some option rather than buying a new TV. We began doing research on roku, purchase of blue ray player/streamers, or Amazon Fire Stick. Our friends had purchased one and recommended it. It arrived in 2 days, we plugged it in and are once again enjoying Amazon TV. We would recommend it to everyone as it is the easiest remote ever!"
"2654","Works great! Took a bit of getting used to vs the Roku. Has most of the channels I have on my Roku as well. No complaints."
"2655","I have not had time to try all the different options yet.  Have been enjoying the music so much.  So far I have recommended it to all my friends.  Am looking forward to being able to take it with me when my daughter and I go on vacation.  Love the voice request option.  I am a  ""senior citizen"" but had no trouble at all getting it set up and operational all by myself.  Very happy to far."
"2656","This is my 2nd  Firestick, Works like a charm.  I am tired of paying high cable bills. We don't need them and being a senior citizen we don't  watch a lot of tv. My husband enjoys the movies."
"2657","Much better than the ROKU! The service, support, and features of the Alexa Fire Stick with the Alexa voice make it the top of the line in my opinion. Would recommend to everyone!"
"2658","Without using apps like sling, it feels almost mandatory to have a Prime video membership. Prime videos gives you some decent movies and Amazon TV series, like Goliath, which I devoured in two nights.Install sling or DirectTV now, and you could potentially get rid rid of expensive cable bundles and save a little money on your bill.I don't think the cost savings is there yet, but kf big names like Amazon, Netflix, etc play their cards right I can see a world where cable providers could become nothing more than broadband ISPS"
"2659","This awesome little gadget took all of five minutes to install; it's truly plug and play. I used to be able to connect my old laptop to my TV with an HDMI cable when I wanted to watch Netflix. But that laptop died and my new one doesn't play well with the TV, so I've only been able to watch Netflix movies and other Internet channels on the laptop. The All-New Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote put an end to that clunky arrangement and opened up a whole new world of commercial-free media and subscription options. And the voice remote rocks!"
"2660","Not enough free channels. Too many to have to pay for."
"2661","I love my fire stick, it was a Christmas gift and I've been using it everyday since!!!!!Update was in love with it..... It is now February 26..... Occasion whenever it feels like it freezing, screen going black, unable to fast forward or rewind with the movie I'm watching freezing up or just so all together, at first thought it was my internet connection but if I can watch the same Hulu movie on my health with the same internet without those issues i conclude it's the stick....omg and over had to change the batteries twice already!!!! Losing my enthusiasm!"
"2662","I have not compared like products (i.e. Roku, Chromecast) and am coming from a Sony bluray interface using preloaded apps. I have recently cut the cable cord and was looking to expand my options. The Fire TV stick offers easy access to a wider variety of downloadable apps and other free digital content, making this a worthy investment. Paired with Amazon Prime we are paying a fraction of the costs we had with cable. Day 1 we were up and running, finding features are something the whole family could enjoy. We love Alexa and the All-New Fire TV Stick!Review modified March 2017: We still like the firestick, but given that I cannot access Google play or Vudu libraries I have opted to purchase the Roku Express to access my various libraries. The Roku remote is definitely less slick and of course there is no Alexa, but it gets the job done. If the firestick easily allowed access to these other libraries, it would be perfect! Come on Amazon, we shouldn't have to purchase other devices or become programmers to enjoy our digital media.."
"2663","These are awesome - got 2 of them. Wish I got these and cut cable/satellite chords a long time ago.Update: I have 2 of these plus a Roku TV and the only thing that sucks is having to re-log into different apps. It would be nice if this would save the username/passwords for quick log-in if this is app required."
"2664","This new Amazon Fire stick arrived to me on time as promised and it works great I suggest everyone get one of these and get rid of their ridiculous High cable bills there is no need to even have cable anymore you can simply use this Amazon Fire TV stick along with other apps and there is no longer any need to pay these high cable prices"
"2665","Had it for a few weeks still haven't learned how to make it work the way I thought it would l. It's nice to have but I wish there was more directions with it could work so I could work it to its full potential"
"2666","The fire tv stick only lasted 2 1/2 weeks and quit working.  Had high hopes because of the praise of other owners.(Revis eon firestick), I was sent a new one. Great customer service."
"2667","Very flexible with lots of options. The video quality is great and the wifi connection is faster than my Roku Stick. My only gripe, is that the USB connection is on the side. It would be great if you had an option on both the side or the button of the stick so it can be compatible with all TV setups. In this case it would have been better to have connection on the bottom for me."
"2668","Works great. However, they’re starting to have glitches with this product. Mine randomly backs itself to the home screen, in the middle of me watching something on an app or something. Both of them that i purchased here do that."
"2669","I plugged it in and signed on to the wifi ... we were watching movies and shows for free and could ""rent"" others if we wanted. We took it to my Mother in law's house in the country. She gets only a few channels on TV but has wifi. I logged in to hers and we watching everything just like we were home. The bonus for me was how much better the streaming connection was with the Fire TV Stick. I have the apps on my HDTV and DVD and Cable system ... the Fire was much faster and more stable. Best electronic product I've bought in a long time!"
"2670","Every time  I have asked Alexa to Launch Amazon, shopping comes up. That's not what I expected or wanted. I want the home page so I can select movies or videos. Also, I remember a time when some movies were available at no charge. I am not able to get to that now or I don't know how to even asking Alexa what I want. So far it has not been a big hit."
"2671","I LOVE IT!! I have no buffering issues and everything is very clear. I love that I can play all my music on Amazon and easily switch from apps and programs by using Alexa! So much better than my Smart TV feature."
"2672","Nothing to write home about. This thing freezes on me all the time. It's slow and doesn't want to start up and I don't like the fact that I can't ever turn it off. Also, the Alexa voice doesn't work all the time."
"2673","For me this is an upgraded version of the original firestick.  The basic new feature is the addition of Alexa that can display some interesting information that is not readily available.  Otherwise, all features work as before."
"2674","I do not watch TV often due to a hectic schedule as a dual career professional. But I decided to purchase the fire stick on the recommendation of a colleague. Glad that I did. It is easy to setup and coupled with a new smartTV makes those viewing moments enjoyable. Definitely recommend."
"2675","This was the best purchase that I've ever made. You have the option to look at so many shows and channels!! I've changed my cable subscription to basic only and I've been saving a bundle."
"2676","Well I have had a first generation fire stick basically since Amazon introduced it, still use it on my bedroom tv and it works flawlessly. This new one has a larger memory and a little different settings menu setup and of course Alexa which is handy and makes it simple to find apps and items on this device with just your voice plus get information to selected questions on just about anything. I have had a few other devices I have used in the past for streaming, the fire sticks are the best out there hands down, and the only two I use."
"2677","Purchased this because it was a cheap experiment in cord cutting. Amazon, playstation tv, and or sling, and I've never been happier. No more commercials, no buffering, just tv. And subscription prices on other services you can use with it are low.  I'm saving $50 a month now.  Give it a shot, amazon has great customer service, if you don't like it, return it. If they won't let you return it (for whatever reason) people EVERYWHERE want these things."
"2678","This Fire TV Stick  was easy to hook up to my Tv and easy to access my wi-fi. I have watched several shows via the Fire Tv Stick.  Only issue is the Remote; it is difficult to open to install the batteries. I had to go to Youtube and watch a helpful video that showed me how to open the Remote."
"2679","I wanted to love this as I'm a big fan of Amazon, but it's just not quite there for me. I appreciate the voice control and the thought that's put into the interface, but the apps on it do stall out too much for me to give it more than 3 stars."
"2680","A good Product overall, but A MAJOR Flaw drops it a full two stars for me. Fire tv does not have any way of playing ultraviolet titles. I knew that Vudu was not supported and that I had to use the less common Flixster to access my ultraviolet library, but they stopped supporting this service as well. I expect my streaming devices to access all of my digital content and so I am sending this back and getting a Roku. Amazon is shooting itself in the foot when I can't access the digital content from the Bluray combo movies that I buy on amazon."
"2681","I love the Fire Stick. This is the 3rd I have purchased. The Alexa voice Remote is fun to 'talk' to. Alexa does not answer in a voice but the menu does respond to voice control."
"2682","Easy to install very good product with Kodi. Wish it was a little bit faster but can't really complain with all the stuff you get to watch. Most definitely worth the investment!"
"2683","I have actually told friends and family about this device and they bought one. I seldom use Alexa, but a friend of mine likes it.If you watch movies, this is very helpful."
"2684","Super easy plug and play. Apps are fairly simple to add. Not a fan of the overly simplistic remote though. Number buttons would have gone a long ways to improve the ease of use."
"2685","I like the idea. Like the ease of setup and use but it often says my network is down when in fact it is not. That's pretty annoying. Not sure if the bigger unit would be better."
"2686","Wished we would have got one a year ago...it's really easy to naviagte. The smart tv has Netflix but Netflix is easier to use on the firestick and so is Amazon prime."
"2687","Very easy to install and use, especially with the voice commands. I have watched a couple of movies, news, and other shorter programs, and am very happy that I invested in this."
"2688","Only had it a short while and still exploring a vast array of TV series, movies, etc.  The streaming is fast...very fast."
"2689","The BEST! Comparing this to ROKU Stick is like comparing an Ipod  to an 8 track player. The Alexa voice feature is even more frosting on this cake. GET IT!!"
"2690","Was having issues with my TV's built in streaming apps (LG TV). Wasted a bunch of time troubleshooting and eventually just bought the firestick to use instead. It's great. I've been using it now a few months, and it's just been reliable as heck. I also have Amazon Unlimited music, and being able to hold a button and say ""play <insert song/artist/album>"" and it just does it has been pretty sweet."
"2691","We love it. Works perfectly and the sound activated commands make it so easy to use.Very easy to install and set up.  The buttons and functions are very intuitive and is a great addition to the home entertainment system."
"2692","Great for the Price! Good quality and I love it!"
"2693","I have a smart TV but it is about 6 years old and the apps are sorta outdated and didn't always stream shows properly so I purchased the Amazon Fire TV Stick and it was very simple to set up and program and works great.  I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking to stream movies or TV shows."
"2694","Love love love the Alexa feature my older fire stick did not have it and when it died I was so happy with this replacement continue to explore the Internet alternatives available on my fire stick and shortly will be discontinuing my cable subscription. The fire stick is such a better value than cable"
"2695","I have officially cut the cable. Install was quick and easy. This product is very easy to use and has many options to discover. I have now put them on two other TV's in my home."
"2696","I just got the fire stick and I think it is great. I live on a college campus so I don't have a normal cable system. The fire stick allows me to catch up on my missed shows easily. I love using the pandora app in the mornings or at night to play music. It is very easy to use and I'm still exploring the different apps on there. I haven't been able to get a good hold on how to use Alexa but hopefully I will get there. I don't have prime so I'm sure there are probably more things I don't have access to but I still find it to be a great buy."
"2697","Great No problem Would buy again."
"2698","So far so good.  Wish it came with a little more instruction as to how to completely set it up and how to acquire the channels you want to watch.  Is a little confusing bur overall I like it."
"2699","For some reason the remote keeps freezing up. Not sure why but nobody else that I know is having this much trouble with it. Also I was unaware you have to have cable to watch many tv shows. Kinda defeats the purpose of having a firestick instead of cable."
"2700","Several of my family members have the Fire Stick and I was excited to be able to access so many movies and tv shows without cable.  It's very easy to install, even for a non-technical grandma like me."
"2701","This was terrific. It took me less than 15 minutes to set up my TV using it, and the only reason it took 15 minutes is because my password is so long. I had bought a different brand for my other TV and that took over two hours."
"2702","by far the best option for streaming. I like it more than my roku 2. I even have a fire tv box and if you don't play lots of games the fire stick goes ahead of any other.,performance is the same and the price just can't bit it."
"2703","The instructions should be clearer.  The back of the device should be easier to open. I had to call to find out the secret handshake needed to put in the batteries.  I also had to call to figure out how to get the fire stick to work and set to set the html input.  It's not very intuitive in use, but the choices and options are pretty awesome."
"2704","As the daily menu on most TV stations qualifies in my mind either as drivel or close enough coverage of current events to raise anyone's blood pressure, and as I am currently bedridden from an accident, I was ecstatic to receive the  fire stick.  I can now watch content that is meaningful to me without fear.  Or I can enjoy escape in genres that I like.  The installation was a breeze; the operation is even easier.  I am thrilled with this product."
"2705","Okay, for some reason it keeps error messaging us something about the USB port but we have moved it from one port to the next and it continues to send us the error message. a bit annoying, otherwise enjoying it."
"2706","I'm not an expert on these things, but I bought this basically to access Netflix on an old television. Very easy to set up and has not failed me yet!  Meets my expectations. Would definitely recommend to others."
"2707","Works great now but had to get a replacement after the original froze up. Amazon was great and helpful in trouble shooting. Prompt replacement. However I had an older cable modem that kept losing connectivity while using the stick. Ordered the latest cable modem and a new wifi router which has the FireTV smoking. The picture quality is superb; much better than the normal cable. The Alexa Voice remote works great as well. Still exploring all the options but Prime movies and YouTube videos are great. Overall, I love the FireTV and would recommend it."
"2708","Purchased specifically to use Sony Vue app and this review is limited to discussion of Vue. (Other apps, like Netflix, and overall ease of use are outstanding) Regarding Vue, Fire Stick interface is excellent and includes a channel guide similar to cable guide.  Easy to set up recordings. Picture quality is excellent.  No stuttering. Only con is the short lag in start up and changing channels.  Probably wouldn't even comment on it except Vue performance on our Roku 3 is faster with almost no lag time. Surprising as the Fire Stick is plenty powerful."
"2709","Good device if you don't have a smart TV but I really think Amazon should give you one month free of prime so you can see if the movies are for you but thankfully I have Netflix and Hulu"
"2710","works well, I have no issues using this. I would highly recommend. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because they were back ordered and the shipping took a extremely long time."
"2711","very happy with easy installation, I like the ease of everything being right  there."
"2712","I love that this enabled me to cut the cable TV cord. I do find the response between remote and controller can be slow, which is frustrating, but once I have a show up and running it works fine. I am not sure if it is the placement of the first stick since it sits behind the TV. We have three - one for each TV - and they seem to work fine when using all at once."
"2713","Just got this yesterday. So far works awesome. I had Roku stick and a Roku 2, Amazon fire stick makes Roku look stupid. I just ordered another one for the bedroom. The thing that I noticed was the apps and games you can download. Easy to set up and operate. Also the Alexa remote is fun to use and does a great job executing what ever commands to give it. Wish I never wasted money on all the Roku boxes I bought."
"2714","It was a gift and I am pleased with whzt it does."
"2715","Excellent choice. The content loads immediately on my tv unlike the smart blu ray I have which takes forever to load the content.  Extremely happy with it. Would recommend to anyone."
"2716","I've only had the fire stick a few days. I absolutely love it!  I can watch all my YouTube videos on a big screen, which is totally awesome!  I encourage everyone to buy this.So I'm now going to update my first review.  Product just stopped working, like 10 minutes ago, for absolutely no reason at all!!!  I switched the HDMI ports and still NOTHING!!!  I'll try to reboot, but if this doesn't work I want a refund!!!!I fixed the problem and the device is working properly.  I'm not sure what happened, but overall, I'm very pleased with the product!!"
"2717","we use this at least once a day, we love it and now I'm wondering what I'm going to do with the bue ray player,xbox 360, and wii that we used to watch netflix on all of the time"
"2718","Its amazing, definitely worth it. I added Kodi and a VPN to mine and I couldn't be happier. It took me a while to cut my cable and I dont regret it after using this fire stick."
"2719","Works great with my Sony Bravia TV. Is great to be able to pick and choose the stations/programs I like. Beats the heck out of cable/Satellite TV. Very happy with the purchase."
"2720","amazon firestick is the best out there.  I trust amazon and their products.  works fast, smooth operation.  the remote feels intuitive to use.  alexa voice makes things easier."
"2721","Do not buy this if you plan on using it with a sound system....  Works okay with the tv but when I hook up any of my three sound systems with any one of my three tv audio outputs I just get distorted sounds within 15-30 minutes..... Its so annoying sometimes the sound lasts 30 minutes sometimes only 5minutes but the sound always gets distorted... I have hooked audio to all types of audio outs on three tvs with the same frustrating results.  Very disappointing, I have to watch the movies I purchased through Amazon only through the tv speakers that suck... ."
"2722","I already had one Amazon Tire TV stick. This additional unit will allow me to expand TV viewing to guest bedroom. Easy to learn to operate. This one has added benefit of Alexa Voice Remote. great value at $29.99. First one was $49.99."
"2723","I ordered the fire stick and not only did it not sync up with the apps of my previous fire stick it was over a week late. A week late after I ordered 2 day guaranteed shipping."
"2724","I like the Amazon Fire stick so far. Haven't really had time to play with it since I installed only two weeks ago. One thing I did notice is I wanted to watch A & E and a couple of other channels. I have antenna TV (no provider, since they all seem to want to suck you dry) so when I try to download the program it tells me to log onto A & E, then go to your TV provider and gave me an access code to put in once I was at that point. Since I have antenna TV, I don't have a TV provider hence unable to access A & E, and yes there's a fee."
"2725","I got a Roku for my parents first, and I liked it. I assumed that the Fire stick would be even better being an amazon product. So I got one for my husband so he could watch The Grand Tour. But then I couldn't access the same apps or networks that I could on the roku, like Disney junior, and other stations that I get on my regular  digital cable subscription because amazon doesn't play nice with TWC Spectrum. So now I'm gonna get another roku so I can watch my programs on the small tv while my husband hogs the big tv watching sports."
"2726","Very pleased with my purchase of the Fire TV Stick.  At first, I had a problem setting it up but was able to eventually get it to work. Hence, I am enjoying watching my favorite movies. A great purchase indeed! Would recommend to friends and family."
"2727","I have finally gotten the Fire Stick and am in love!  I had no idea I was so behind the times and how EASY it was to install and use!  So super excited to cancel cable finally!"
"2728","This is the best. Now I can take the Fire Stick with me from room to room to watch a favorite program. Very easy to use and Instant Netflix. I should have gotten this ages ago!"
"2729","This thing is awesome, I've been recommending to everyone and anyone that is willing to listen to me to get one of these things.  I love that this platform is open and they allow you to install 3rd party applications on the Fire TV Stick.  Kodi is the best!"
"2730","Geeze, I now realize what I've been missing!Plug & play, that's it. Minor installation, but I'm so pleased with this great new tool.I was sad to realize that Google products and Amazon products are not compatible.  My new Smart TV could not stream Amazon Prime movies.  Now I can, and its all great!"
"2731","You can not leave it plugged in like others.  You have to unplug it when you get through watching.  Leaving it plugged up causes it to overheat and cause your TV screen to mess up.  That is what I was told when I called support.  Said they were working on a fix.  I don't understand how it messes your TV up and not just the input of the Fire Stick."
"2732","I've been refusing the Apple tit for a while. So long, shitty Apple TV. You will not be missed.The Fire TV Stick is, by far, the easiest to instal and set up tech I have ever purchased. Recently bought a Roku tv for the family and the Amazon unit for myself. The Roku is fine, but I'm loving the Fire TV Stick. It's so simple and functions without flaw. Picture and sound are perfect. The voice remote works way better than I thought it would.I got mine for $29, but I'd pay twice that for this quality and capability."
"2733","This would be an easy five star if it wasn't so difficult to remove the back to change the battery. I'm sure for most folks it isn't an issue but it isn't friendly for my mature. arthritic hands ;)"
"2734","This has completely replaced my roku. I am even considering cancelling my Netflix account because of all the movies I now have access too. I will probably purchase these for everyone for next Christmas."
"2735","This newer Firestick is soooooo much better than the older one. I went through 2 of those that didn't work properly and just as I was about to give up on them I decided to try the all new one and it works really well. They connect better and faster to my WiFi, no buffers every few minutes. Before I use to think it was my Internet so I ordered a booster to help but when I got this Firestick I decided to try it first before connecting the booster, it worked perfectly fine so needless to say I sent the booster back. Grear improvement over the last one."
"2736","this was a B'day present and since I received it I just love it. I love that I can see movies and TV shows and it is so easy to use. Plus, I downloaded my Netflix on it. It's just great. What else can I say."
"2737","Light weight, HD picture, instant access to all my PRIME content with voice recognition to boot.  Placed it in my teenage daughter's room for her TV after unplugging from cable.  She hasn't complained a bit and enjoys it immensely."
"2738","I purchased this Fire TV Stick to get Netflix so I could watch a certain movie.  Once it was all set up I spoke into the remote but nothing happened.  I don't know if we did something wrong, but I was able to watch the movie on Netflix with the one month free trial without Alexa."
"2739","Still early in full determination. We are pretty low tech, so quite apprehensive on delving into this concept.But so far this gets 5 stars for efficiency of arrival, ease of use, speaking response feature (uncanny)and quality of picture translation. Definately a fabulous value in this innocuous non-threatening littlegizmo. As advertised.So many options to peruse and enjoy as we parked our RV next to the ocean with a minor wifi signal.*Surprised tho, that an older movie selection (Dazed & Confused) was not a free movie."
"2740","I love it. It streams in very high quality and it does not lag at all. Only complain is that I cannot cast from my laptop like a chromecast. There are multiple casting apps but only for mobile device. I haven't found one for browsers yet. Let me know if you have."
"2741","I love it, I hate watching shows on my IPad and computer and now I can watch my HBOgo on here, plus I can watch acorn TV which I love. You can also play games and if need be ask Alexa for help."
"2742","One of my best purchases yet! As a college student even though we get free cable, sometimes it doesn't always work and half the time it's not I want to watch. Getting one of these was perfect for me! I really only use Netflix and HBO (jailbroken) but it's great for movies and everything else. When itnwas updating I was having an issue using some of the apps but after I haven't had any and it works brand new! Would highly recommend it esepcially for a college student"
"2743","I love it, except for when its busy on weekends. I live in an apartment building with supposedly 100Mbps of speed, and I frequently encounter streaming issues, right in the middle of shows. Even (especially it seems) the kids' movies!!!I apologize in advance if this isn't a Fire stick issue, but the pop ups on the screen appear guilty as charged, (ie: ""We're sorry,,  we seem to have encountered a problem,,,""yada yada. : /Kat J.Orlando"
"2744","I really love it.  It makes my Amazon Prime Movies and Netflix movies come on a large screen instead of the small computer screen.  Easy to set up.  I was very happy about that."
"2745","Absolutely love my Amazon Firestick. I use it solely for the Kodi App, where streaming is endless! I cancelled my outrageous cable bill several months ago, after I bought my first firestick. I've saved hundreds of dollars! No monthly subscriptions and I can watch ANYTHING I want. I have no problems streaming with my ridiculously slow internet speeds (6 mb max)."
"2746","I was a loyal roku fan until I tried out the Fire Stick on a wall mounted tv.  This had a better price than the Roku stick, and I'm happy with basically the same channel choices.  I thought the Alexa thing was something I would never use, but it easy much easier to find the shows/ movies I may want to watch, and for basic questions like ""What's the weather today.""  When you cut the cord like I did, I don't have basic channels on the TV in my room.  Alexa basically lets me find out the things I may need to get my day moving."
"2747","Absolutely love the firestick except for the remote.  My brother has the one without Alexa on it and his works fine. I purchased 4 firesticks with alexa and the remote spends half the time not working.  I have tried replacing the batteries with no help.  Each of the firesticks with Alexa have the same issue.  It gets very irritating. Also if you use Alexa in any other app to try and find anything it takes you to the amazon account not the app.So if you can get it without Alexa I would suggest to do it that way...Missy L"
"2748","The Fire TV Stick generally works well.  However I believe it could be improved by adding an Ethernet port for higher speed connectivity and more memory for better buffering.  The remote is a little small for my preference and the top row of buttons feels too close to the where you push for the down arrow.  The back of the controller can also be difficult to remove when it is necessary to replace the batteries.  A previous channel button would be a nice addition.  The stick tends to get fairly warm when used for an extended period."
"2749","great buy many shows to watch. great quailty"
"2750","Got on Wednesday, overheated 3x by Thursday pm.  Waiting for replacement.  Might change opinion when replacement arrives.Replacement received and product still overheating.  Determined cause due to connection to tv thru audio/video converter as both use separate power sources. Am in hopes that problem will resolve itself when longer HDMI cord is used for connecting firstick to converter in order to create more than 3"" separation. Update to follow"
"2751","Fire Stick w/Alexa Works as expected! Forget all the ones saying bad streaming or whatever. Get an account, get a stick and stream away! No issues thus far, don't know when to use Alexa. Not sure if it's mentioned, but has 6gb space for a bunch of 100mb apps! It was worth the month wait! I will update as necessary..."
"2752","The Fire TV Stick is awesome...  In fact, I closed my Hulu and Netflix accounts.  With my Prime membership and the free Kodi app,(Simply search ~ ""install kodi 17.3 on firestick"" ~ on YouTUBE for easy step by step instructions to make your television really come alive.)I get so many more, movies, TV networks, etc...  I would have givin a 5 star rating but the stick is a little slow on occasion, but I love the stick anyway!  I would highly recommend this device."
"2753","Could use another one - this is a fantastic product.  Wish it was easier to remove from my large screen TV - connection is pretty well buried on the wall - check for easy access to HDMI port on your TV"
"2754","This is a very good change to the Fire Stick. We absolutely love this new one. It has more to offer and the voice control is a pleasant addition to the platform. Keep up the good work Amazon."
"2755","I recently just moved into a new house and I've always wanted a fire stick. I've heard so many great things about it. I finally stopped by the Amazon pop up store at a local center and bought one.No. Regrets.I use the stick more than I use my cable tv. I watch Netflix, Hulu, listen to Spotify, and browse all in one. The Fire Stick is super convenient and some of my friends who have stopped by now want one."
"2756","Alexa is deaf and dumb but the fire stick and remote are wonderful if your ""smart"" TV does not get all of the popular streaming platforms.  Easy to set up and easy to navigate"
"2757","Just received it recently.  Still working to learn how to use the thing.  Have watched several movies. Some were great, others had poor sound quality.  Something new to learn."
"2758","Got this for my not tech savy mother. She loves the voice remote. Where she couldn't navigate similar products. All she was to do with the fire stick is tell it what she wants"
"2759","This is an amazing product. I love that I can tell Alexa what I want to do or watch. I have my sling tv app on the firestick as well as Hulu. It’s amazingly convenient and super fast."
"2760","Having a chromecast got me really spoiled. I was surprised that I had to download essencial apps on my amazon fire TV stick like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, etc. It also doesn't support YouTube or YouTube music. I thought it's a big price to pay in order to watch prime TV.However, the remote with Alexa has its ""touch,"" I like not having to type things down or use my phone to control the TV.I currently have a switch with my chromecast, fire TV and PS4, but not everybody has this luxury in order to use all possible apps."
"2761","very disappointed, we had to refund pligged into our smart TV and no connection maybe we just got a bad one, but as always Amazon returned the product with no problem!!si 1 star only because it didnt work.....5 stars on customer satisfaction with Amazon!!"
"2762","It's all right but, it freezes sometimes.  I also do not like that everything on it I have to join in order to see the shows.If I pay for Amazon then I do not think I have to pay for any of the movies.  Do not know if I will continue with it."
"2763","Once I had the kid next door redo so the first thing up is KODI and ExodusALL is Great.  It has lots if stuff loaded that I will never use and some that I will.  Just bought my secondfrom wil nd have emailed his link to over a dozen famiky members."
"2764","I was very surprised by how easy this was to get started. Its so simple grandma did it herself! She's loving it already.UPDATE:The remote already stopped working after only 4 months."
"2765","It's been 2 months since we've received our fire stick and we still love it.  Truth be told we still haven't used the alexa voice remote part yet.  It just makes accessing our prime movies, Netflix, or online videos quicker and easier.  There are definitely some other 'hidden' bonuses as well.  At $39 this was very little risk with a high reward."
"2766","I must say that I was reluctant to make a change since I had always used Apple TV. However the fire tv has great features, and apps that you can enjoy and is really easy to use and instal. The fact that you can call Alexa from the remote control make things easier to handle. I really recommend the fire stick."
"2767","So far, so good.  Has worked really really well over all.  A couple sluggish glitches,  some of which i hope will be helped if i get a wifi boosterbut otherwise,  so far,  i've been very pleased with it.  I'll be very happy to get rid of my over priced cable and replace it with this for mytv needs"
"2768","I gave this 2 stars because the remote is junk. The Fire stick functions as described. Setup took a very long time and has no messages to give you a clue you had to sit and wait. I have given up on the remote I constantly had to remove the batteries or it would get ""stuck"". However, I downloaded the Fire Stick remote app which works. The app is a little qwerky but once you figure it out its works well.In my opinion they should lower the price and not even include the remote (just warn people they need smart phone)."
"2769","Tried tricking the remote with difficult and similar sounding words.  I was surprised how accurate it was, always got it right on the first try.  The remote responds  well in navigation.  Love, that it comes with an HDMI adapter to allow easy fitment if multiple HDMI's are un use on the TV. For being a stick, response is quick when opening apps and features.  Other than initial startup, I experienced no buffering while streaming videos.  I have Amazon Prime, and being able to play my music was a bonus. Very happy with the buy, well worth the price."
"2770","It works as intended....sometimes...is difficult to load the Plex app, which is the main reason why I bought it. Is not advertised but you would think it works with other Amazon products like the Amazon echo. Hey there is a good idea. Overall is ok but chromecast works waaay better, is cheaper and smoother loading shows. I would not recommend this to a friend."
"2771","Very disappointed, works quite well with a TV, but for me personally one of the top draws was the ""you can now take it anywhere, as long as you have internet"", which is why I got it in the first place.  Wanted to take my ""tv"" and movie choices with me.  I wanted this for my laptop, so wherever I go I can watch whatever I want.  I will say it's easy to use, to set up and to watch on my tv and I can move it from one tv to another.  Maybe the description should change to reflect it will not work with laptop computers."
"2772","Really like this fire stick but really wish it had an Ethernet connection, the wifi can be spotty at times and my router is within 10 ft of it. Yes you can install Kodi on this."
"2773","Oh man, if you can jail break this thing, it is soooo worth beyond the amazon price. I bought three of them for my house, one for my parents, and one for at work. Can't beat it!"
"2774","Easy to set up, great parental controls. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to cable. It can be very easy to purchase apps that are not free, so I highly recommend using the parental controls to require a pin be entered before purchases."
"2775","I really like this stick. It has  everything you've had come to expect only supercharged with 4k streaming ability and other premium features. Much faster than the first stick. I think everyone will be pleased with the performance."
"2776","Easy peasy. Once you get used to the idea that voice control is the ONLY control. One thing I haven't figured  out is how to tell what's been watched before in a series, if Amazon video was used on a computer."
"2777","This item is great.  I love it, it is well worth what I paid for it. A must buy, you can get your,At Amazon.com.  so do not delay, get yours now. Thank you fcoldshower1."
"2778","Got it installed, but the buffering is so annoying.  I love movies, only sometimes can't clearly enjoy them, due to constant buffering and wavy bad pictures.  Very bad picture quality on most movies through Fire TV Stick."
"2779","So far we really like it. Streams well. There has been several times we had to take the batteries out of the remote and put them back in because would freeze up on us. We are still trying to figure out available shows. No regrets getting it."
"2780","The Fire TV Stick is a must-have add-on if you're a Prime member and like watching movies! Nice addition to any TV setup - basically expands on existing Smart-TV functions, however there are too many choices that require renting, buying, or signing up for something. Stick with the Amazon Prime programming available (free!) and you will love it! Plenty of free apps to choose from too! The Alexa voice remote works great and finds just about anything you may be searching for. Small price to pay for a nice little device that performs well!"
"2781","This is a definite buy. I have owned a Roku, Chromecast and Apple TV. The Fire TV stick is by far the most impressive. I was even able to install Kodi on the stick with no problems. The voice remote is excellent and very easy to use, I can even get sport scores just by asking Alexa, ""What is the Red Sox score?"" and there it is on screen giving me the score. It's really excellent and the only reason I have it is because my girlfriend bought it for Father's Day. For 40 bucks, it is a really good deal."
"2782","Love the fire stick and have been using it for about 9 months now.  I took a star away because I lose the remote on a daily basis.  I downloaded the app on my phone after we lost it for the 30th time, but would like my kids to be able to use it without commandeering my phone. I have yet to lose my tv remote or PS4 remote for more then 3 minutes because they are normal sized.  When I finally find it this time, I'm attaching to my couch arm like the pen at the liquor store.  It shouldn't have to come to this."
"2783","The stick is easy to use and portable. I take it with me when I travel. You can also download other appts at a small free of .99-3.99. There is a large selection of  appts to choose from for movie. The remote is really to simple and I am yet to be able to forward wind a movie. The stick has much more storage for hundreds of downloads. Amazon limits the amount of sticks u can buy at one time. So if you need more than 4 for gift during the holiday. You will have to go to two different stores to purchase more."
"2784","Works well. Sometimes gets too hot on my Patio tv. Yes I live in the Phoenix area desert. So if you use Kodi or stream too much it can shut down in hot Shaded environment.  Wasn't too hot for me... Just the Stick. 😀"
"2785","I love it. I wish there was more free content. But with everything prime has to offer and the portability. The resolution is also a treat so is the ease of use. I got rid of my ps4 and I'm glad I did.Recommend this hopefully will be able to cast phone and laptop in the future but it is my only gripe. Without kodi."
"2786","Love it, works like a champ. Our DVD player that was supposed to play Amazon Prime movies did so for a month & then stopped. The Fire Stick was recommended & works great. Easy install & does exactly as it was advertised."
"2787","All hooked up and amazing. Technology challengedpeople ,like myself, people can use this!!  Easy install. Alexa products are amazing and the benefits keep coming year after year!!  The gift that definitely keeps giving!!"
"2788","I'm going to give this 3 stars because from my understanding, I thought with the fire stick you just download the app of the shows or movies you like, and you get to watch for FREE... NOT lol everything you have to pay for, so I feel like $40 was wasted. My friends spoke so highly of it and all the new movies and shows that her and her boyfriend  get to watch and come to find out they had theirs jail broken. So I'm still trying to navigate it as well."
"2789","This did not work out for me as well as I had hoped.  First, it is too slow, and second it has too little memory.  My internet connection is not the best, but that could be overcome with a larger buffer I think.  When I stream, it plays about 20 seconds of video, then buffers for 20 seconds and repeats the process throughout the video.The voice recognition also does not recognize my voice very well so I get a lot of ""I didn't understand that, could you repeat"".For me, it is pretty nearly worthless."
"2790","I am a Roku fan.  All my TV's are equipt with such.  Unfortunately, AT&T has delayed the release of the Directv Now app for Roku.  The only reason I have the Fire Stick is for Directv Now so I can view it without using data.  When the Directv Now app for Roku comes out, I will stop using the Fire Stick.  In general, I find the Fire Stick to be confusing.  Have to go through 3 steps just to get to the DtvN guide.  Alexa can get confused as well (or maybe it is I?)."
"2791","Bought to test out how all of this new (to me) technology works...Firestick is great and a nice addition if you're thinking of ""cutting the cable cord"" like we're getting ready to do soon!!  All I need to do next, is get a HD Antenna, a good ""ISP"" (Researching those now) and we're done with paying high Cable TV prices for good!!!"
"2792","I really do! I've been needing a better streaming system than what I've been using. (An old blu-ray DVD player.) The industry is going more towards streaming and this little thing has such a great user friendly interface along with everything a person would need to enjoy all the shows on television but at your convenience. If you're looking at some options I would definitely recommend this."
"2793","I love the Firestick. It is easy to install. Navigating the home page is easy, finding my Apps and using them is so simple. I use it daily and am a happy, satisfied customer."
"2794","What an easy, convenient little device! I have smart TVs but this makes it even easier and opens up a world of apps. I LOVE the Alexa voice feature as well! Highly recommend!"
"2795","I had to return it because there was not a port on the Smart TV for this device.  Also disappointed that Amazon charged postage when it was returned.  I thought I used prime!"
"2796","system was easy to set up once you got the hang of it. I had to match a rohu with the amazon which was a little tricky. older set did not have a hdmi imput and ryko was the only unit that gould be set up to work on older set;"
"2797","Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!! I bought 2 just to begin with because I really want to drop cable completely. I'm dropping cable and only keeping my Wireless connection. I may eventually eliminate that in addition if I find a cheaper, but high-speed and extremely reliable wireless connection for my home."
"2798","We decided to do away with cable and this was our best buy since!  We love it.  I am waiting to purchase another one.  We have been able to get everything we watched on our satellite TV.  We do have to wait till the next day for some things, but that's not too terrible."
"2799","For years I played Netflix and Amazon Prime through my tv by connecting my computer to my tv with a hdmi cable.  This is a much simpler way to play these programs and it works well."
"2800","I still have not hooked up my Fire TV stick.  My HDMI's are all used on my TV so I need to install a HDMI splitter.  I never thought I would use all four HDMI spots on my TV but it is easy to do."
"2801","Worth every penny!  We are watching our favorite programs and sports.... for $40/month!  You still need internet provider... but that’s all.  We have a smart TV, so I’m sure that helps as well."
"2802","I have bought a half-dozen of these for myself and family members. I would love to give it 5 Stars except for with every single one of them we have had problems with the remote not working or working very sketchy. It is extremely frustrating when you are trying to do something and you have to press the button on the remote 50 times to get it to do anything. I know I'm not the only one that has experienced this because like I said it is happen on every single remote for every single fire stick I have bought"
"2803","Firestick is a wonderful device that was inexpensive and seems to be better than cable.  I expected very slow delays in loading movies but quite honestly it loads right up with minimum delay.  The additional feature of Alexa is awesome!  It clearly understands your commands and you don't have to waste a lot of time repeating yourself.  It really is a smart device!  I would recommend everyone shut the cable companies down and save your hard earned money and invest in a Firestick for a fraction of the price."
"2804","Honestly this is an awesome product. I hadn't any idea about Amazon fire stick until one of my friends introduced it to me. I didn't hesitate but went straight online and placed an order. It took a while for it to arrived but it is worth the wait and much more worth more than the price. I'm an ardent news consumer and I couldn't have ask for more. Tons and tons of movies inter alia.I'd definitely without an equivocation recommend this product; amazon fire stick to anyone.Great job Amazon!"
"2805","I am frustrated with trying to find TV shows or movies from any source other than Amazon.  I realize they sold me the product.  I changed to the Fire Stick from my Apple TV to add Amazon Prime to my options for viewing.  Instead, I lost everything else.  I feel manipulated. Searches in Netflix, Hulu or any other available app inevitably send me to a pay-per-view on Amazon.  However, I must say I have been a Kindle HD user and an Amazon Prime member for years and for the most part, have had very positive experience with the company."
"2806","Very happy with this purchase .  I dropped  Dish Network over a price increase , which they refused to negotiate a decent price .  Win Win for me no more  montly bill from Dish ."
"2807","Access to some great content through Prime. at $40 it's a real bargain. Setup was fast, painless and worked perfectly right out of the box. Alexa is a little dyslexic but mostly on target."
"2808","Love it.  I honestly don't know how I functioned prior to the Fire TV Stick.  Bought 1 previously and my daughter confiscated it for herself, even though she already had a Roku.  So I had to buy me another one.  Yes, had to."
"2809","Love the firestick but had a problem afraid to put it on my new receiver why... my old receiver shut down my power but weird example stereo on volume not to loud anymore if anything happen TV wise like a gun shout receiver turns off.. my sound bar every 10 minutes turns off ...even my VCR also goes off time frame maybe 20 minutes not to sure on it yet so had to buy a new receiver... what now need new firestick already did the restore or redo.."
"2810","I hav had Apple TV, ROKU and FIRE TV is definitely the best. The price is amazing, Alexa feature is really nice and easy install and operation. Got this for my Mother and I haven’t gotten one call for help yet. If you knew my Mom, you’d know how amazing that really is!"
"2811","I replaced my Apple TV with this and couldn't be happier. I'm really amazed that such a great little device can be priced so affordably. It was super simple to setup -- somewhere around 20 minutes between opening the package and firing up an episode of The Grand Tour, including a software update. The newest update makes the UI *much* better. Alexa, whom I had already fallen in love with since buying the Echo, is accurate and fast. It has all the streaming services you'd expect, along with (obviously) Prime Video, which was the main reason I wanted this. Sideloading Kodi was fairly simple and gave me access to my home's media server. And I was pleasantly surprised that I can still cast my Android devices to the TV like Chromecast. I honestly have zero complaints; this thing is absolutely wonderful!"
"2812","The internet speed and reception need to be good in order to enjoy. My kids also have firesicks with passwords and I have to put in the password for every move they make on the firestick which is frustrating."
"2813","This is a FANTASTIC product. Aesthetically great. Great interface. Smooth, very fast networking protocol. I've been very happy with this product. So much so that I am buying two more. Thanks!"
"2814","Decent, nothing special. The alexa feature that they rave about so much can only be used with amazon prime content NOT netflix. So if your on a netflix show and tell alexa to rewind 30 minutes, it wont work. Which most people watch netflix not amazon prime videos. My 4 year old roku I had before this is better. Would not recommend."
"2815","I originally bought this item as a gift, and after seeing it in action I had to have one for myself! I must say I am obsessed with it, this is by far my favorite item of 2016. It is absolutely brilliant, real tech that makes my life so much easier. It is so much more than just a stick for Netflix (which is why I originally bought it), it gives your older, but much loved TV, the chance to be a genius! I love that Amazon can offer this revolutionary item for such an affordable price. Thank you for bringing great tech to everybody."
"2816","Opened up the package. Very easy to install and download prime products. I like the ease in which you're able to see all available content and the Alexa assist feature.  Many TV series you're able to sit and run consecutively with little or no commercial content to be able to catch up on your favourite shows. The ability for the system to stream HD video without delay on my 50mps Verizon service was note worthy. Well worth the price and should be considered an reasonable alternative if you are looking to lower your TV cable bill"
"2817","I own both an Amazon Firestick and an Apple TV(gen 2).  Firestick has a lot of problems with buffering if anyone else in the house is using the internet.  Never have that problem with the Apple TV regardless of other devices in use.  Amazon Stick is a great bargain compared to Apple TV and is the only way we can stream our Amazon Prime movies to our television so for the price it works as expected I suppose.  Anytime we want to stream Netflix or anything outside of Amazon Prime we use the Apple TV as the quality is far superior."
"2818","My daughter and son-in-law brought this stick for my birthday last year (2016). It work really well and I was super excited. For the past 3 months I have notice my batteries are not lasting. I thought that maybe I was sleeping on it because I kept it in the bed with me. So I changed it and kept it on the side of the bed. It is still doing the same thing. I have never dropped it so I don't have a clue to what is wrong with it. Other than that it was a great Stick."
"2819","I wonder why I bought this.  It works great on my newest Samsung TV, but other than voice functions, it does not seem to offer much more than I could have gotten just with the Smart features of the TV itself.  I purchased it to use on my main TV, an older Samsung HDTV, but it gives a mode error no matter what the output resolution is set to.  Samsung tech support states that it will not work with my TV and if I had done more on-line searching for compatibility issues, I would have seen that I am not alone with this problem.  Oh well."
"2820","Great in just about every way, except picture quality, for which I nearly knocked this to three stars...  Fast, well-featured, but does not even come close to 1080p on my 1080p television.  I have a 32"" TV in a guest bedroom and quality is very poor and can become pixelated with quick movement.  Still image quality is good (screen saver pictures, etc.), but action is annoying to watch."
"2821","Everything works as I expected, I haven't managed to get Alexa working yet, but I am sure it will as soon as I make the time to call support.I have Directv Now with the Fire TV Stick what more could I ask for?"
"2822","I received the new Fire Stick on time, as expected, and found it very easy to install and set up. My Amazon account info was already in place. It has been wonderful to use, and is faster than I expected. It has not gotten hung up at all, so far. I was pleasantly surprised at the number of additional, optional apps offered, so in addition to all of the Amazon Prime content, we have an amazing amount of non-Amazon content to view as well. My family and I now have more choices as to what to watch on the TV than we know what to do with."
"2823","I am very happy with the Fire TV stick with Alexa voice. It does everything I had hoped it would do. This is my second Fire Stick. I will always have one, or two for that matter."
"2824","Bought two....one worked, one didnt...."
"2825","Decided to buy this for my mom because ive heard such good things. I have the apple TV and love it but i found that you can't download extra channels from whats on it. The firestick literally had every channel you can imagine! MyMom absolutely loves it although shes still working on figuring out how to use it. Recieved it  the day after i ordered it which was incredible. Deff a happy customer here :)"
"2826","I don't want to return it as this is one of the best purchases I've made from Amazon but...my remote is faulty.  When I'm using the remote midway through navigation it will not function.  However, if I remove one of the batteries and reinsert it the remote will start to work again. So I may have to remove and reinsert one of the batteries about four times to get to the app I want.  I will also get a notification on my TV screen that my batteries are dangerously low and they need to be changed days after I inserted new energiser batteries which made me think I threw out the batteries which came with the remote too soon as I got that prompt.  It could be quite frustrating using my remote the way it is but the end result is when I actually get to the movie of TV show it plays well.  I wish I had a good working remote :-("
"2827","Great product. Video is clear. Much programming is available. I would recommend this product to all who are looking for a good streamingproduct. This is as good as advertised."
"2828","big improvement from the the first model in speed. hope the 3rd version is even better! Using a raspberry pie is still much faster, with a broader array of option to use it for."
"2829","This works like a charm. It was easy enough to install and I checked it out for about 10 minutes and haven't been back to it since. As I have been preoccupied with other things."
"2830","Love my fire stick! Love that I can find something to watch on prime on my fire tablet and send it to the stick to watch and the stick even turns on the TV and then plays the movie!"
"2831","Awesome Product, Super easy to use. super fast shipping. Highly recommend you can watch lots of great shows with the firestick... Easy to move around to different tvs too..."
"2832","Best ever!  Everyone should own one of these!  Ditch the cable and save yourself money with the firestick.  Easy to set up and download apps!  Start watching within minutes!"
"2833","Love this!!  It is easy to use handy to take with for use at motels while traveling!Lots of stuff to watch...although i wish the movies u can rent were not so pricey!!"
"2834","I don’t leave reviews, but I had to on this one. I have Apple TV in my bedroom and I needed something for my living room but I didn’t want to pay $150 if I could avoid it. I guess you get what you pay for. I like that I can watch everything I can watch on Apple TV (if not more), but I can even make it through a 90 minute movie without the internet dropping. Apple TV is farther away and around a corner from the router and it never drops.  It was an incovience at first, but now I’m upset I didn’t return it."
"2835","I really appreciate how the Fire Stick allowed me to keep my current televisions yet still upgrade my TV viewing experience. Some folks don't mind buying new technology like TV's as they come out with the newest and latest, but I was satisfied with my TV's and didn't need a new one. I'm still exploring my options with the Fire Stick.The one issue folks need to be aware of is the importance of your wireless service being adequate enough to support streaming. If you can't stream, owning the Fire Stick is a mute point."
"2836","This device is fantastic.  I cancelled satellite and went to Hulu live tv.  Fire stick surpassed my expectations.  I had no idea that picture quality would be as good as it was on satellite.  Very pleased"
"2837","We finally got fed up with the cable company, 300 channels of nothing to watch, and literally cut the cord the day this arrived.  Not that there is an abundance of free programming, but at least as much as we were paying $100 per month for...and we are still exploring other options (Netflix, Hulu, Sling, and even rabbit ears).  Also contemplating adding Plex to the media system.Most important, we've found no issues with our DSL connection at 7.5 MBA."
"2838","Loved the idea of  getting free movies, tv shows, etc., but if you don't have HBO, Netflex, or other ones you pay for there isn't much to watch unless you rent or buy.  I decided to try Amazon prime and that is where you get a whole new world of free movies and tv shows.  Now I'm totally happy with my choices of movies and tv shows.  Gave it 4 stars because if you don't have prime or HBO or Netflix there's nothing much to watch without renting or buying content."
"2839","Neat little device. Only $40.00. Recommend.  Only complaint is the remote is hard to open to install batteries. Be prepared to use a knife for assistance. Fire Stick works fine."
"2840","Has a lot of great content, especially when you have a cable subscription because you can verify your cable subscription and then avail yourself of apps and even live content for those channels (sometimes there's an additional monthly charge, sometimes it's free).  Menus and channel changes are fast.  Had it for a week or so, and I haven't tried voice commands yet, but I like that idea and will use it.  For me, this stick is ideal for secondary tv's (bedroom, exercise area, etc), because I don't need to rent cable boxes on every tv, and it allows our Netflix, Pandora, Sirius, and Amazon subscriptions to be used more, as well as we get new channels/apps (and other cable channels as mentioned) on these secondary tvs as well.  The interface is nicer than the other major streaming stick device we have, but has less free programming choices.  Not sure if that really matters for a secondary tv because there's more than enough content particularly when some of the lesser known additional channels/apps on the other device (and this one) have what I consider low value content (old movies, reruns, made for tv movies, unreleased b movies, etc) that I probably won't watch/use.  I am using it with amplified over the air antennas for free access to local channels on these tvs - simply change the input source on the tv, and there they are.  The major tv networks and some local news is available on on the Stick as well (sometimes for a charge).  As a bonus to the added diversity of options, in a few months, the Fire TV Stick will pay for itself in reduced equipment rentals, after which there will be actual monthly savings (vs renting those cable boxes) into perpetuity."
"2841","I love this fire stick.  It was easy to setup and is easy to operate.  I love the voice activated remote.  It actually understands me.  I'm going to purchase another one for my upstairs t.v."
"2842","Fantastic addition to the family entertainment options and expansion of Alexa's services.  We love the way we speak to Alexa, who immediately finds to show, movie, music etc. we are looking for.  What a great gift this Fire Stick has been!"
"2843","The Fire Stick has a better resolution that the Roku2 device I was using.  Streaming is great on my internet connection.  Apps are easy to install.  The downside making this a really bad purchase is the REMOTE STOPPED WORKING ON DAY TWO.  Come on, really?  Can't we do better than that?  If I didn't already have The Fire tablet, the device would've been useless to me.UPDATE, Technical Support came through.  Worked with them, they are sending a replacement and should get it Tuesday."
"2844","its okay, its better if u have amazon prime to be able to get good movies n tv shows. also, not a great selection of streaming channels, our roku player seems to have more. the interface is user friendly thats forsure. we recieved this firestick for purchasing a month of Directv Now. it kind of lags sometimes as well."
"2845","Works great I would buy again"
"2846","It is a neat item but a lot of the programing you can't sign up for it you don't have a TV provider like Hulu, Vero, Espn and the list goes on so you aren't able to see live streaming or even recent showings in some cases."
"2847","The firestick is a great enhancement to my entertainment.  I can watch shows and movies that I had not been able to before because I was working.  Now I can catch up.  Being a Prime member is a great asset as well."
"2848","Love this. Exploring all the apps deciding if I want to get rid of cable all together"
"2849","One of the best purchases I've ever made.  I love it!"
"2850","Super easy to set up and use.  We have smart TVs but this makes it easier to access everything at the same place.  Would recommend to anyone and am considering getting another one!"
"2851","Fire stick and prime videos turned out to be an excellent purchase for me. The device performs well. The video resolution is excellent. I am truly satisfied with my purchase."
"2852","Omg hands down super awesome. Easy to set up. Intuitive interface.  Cross platform intergation and search works really well. Voice contols are accurate. What's not to love?"
"2853","I like it but every once in a while I have to unplug and re plug it because it's not recognized. I don't use the Voice command feature so I have no opinion about that part."
"2854","Finally got unlimited internet at home, so I can watch my Amazon prime. Absolutely love the fire tv stick. Easy to hookup to the tv and easy to use. Been watching everyday."
"2855","Okay okay....so it has voice control. But I keep forgetting because I have to push the voice button. WHat's the point of voice control if you have to push something first. You spoiled me with Alexa Amazon.  Also I can't seem to figure out how to add other net applications. Ease of use is awesome. Plug it in and away you go. Remote appears to be sturdy and well made and light and small as well. The world is getting to be a much more pleasant place. No longer need my old Roku to connect now I can do it all with this tiny fire stick."
"2856","Best investment I've purchased in a long time,  only thing I can give advice to anyone is if your not that great on doing things on a computer with transferring apps as such then save yourself the frustration and purchase the fire stick with Kodi and exodus already downloaded to the stick.  I just wanted asap but wish I just purchased it from Amazon from the beginning due to the fact that I suckered when it comes to doing any stuff like that.  still I HAVE NO REGRETS IT'S AS I SAID THE BEST INVESTMENTS."
"2857","My daughter bought this for me and I received it this morning. It's 9pm and I would say it has paid for itself already. It was easy to set up. I was watching videos 10 minutes after I opened the package."
"2858","I have the Fire Stick model right before this one, and this new one is way faster. It's actually beating my TiVo XL4 on streaming speed. If you're on the fence don't be - the Fire Stick is money well spent. Love that I can take it with me to hotels and my family's house when visiting and I don't have to worry if they have Netflix, Hulu, etc. because everything I need is on my Fire Stick."
"2859","This is the perfect streaming device.  An easy setup and a very intuitive product.  Literally turns your non-smart television into a smart television.  Had the chrome cast device but it only worked with Netflix.  This device places every streaming entity onto your television screen.  All you do is click on the one you want.  Having the Alexa Voice remote is the icing on the cake.  Prompt Alexa with the movie you want, and it will appear on your screen, ready for you to watch.  You can ask her any question, just like the Amazon Echo."
"2860","Love me some Firestick. I had to get a 2nd one because the first that Amazon sent had problems buffering. One call Amazon sent a new one and it works great. Use it for CBS all access and netflix."
"2861","Great value and easy to set up!"
"2862","Great little device. Seems to run a little faster/smoother than my Roku Streaming stick. And with the ability to add more apps, this is a great little entertainment device."
"2863","I saw this on sale and grabbed it. I have a Roku 3, and I didn't need a new streamer, but I saw it had certain gaming advantages. I won't get into the sordid details but it basically was an erroneous purchase at the end that sort of worked out. The Amazon Fire TV was never something that appealed to me as I already had full access to Prime on my other players, but if you're like me and deeply ingrained in the Prime economy, this will be a huge upgrade to the way you use those Prime benefits.Much like the fire tablets,  this is certainly a product for people who are invested in their Prime Membership.  Alexa brings a new dimension to the Amazon TV systems that you will absolutely miss in other streaming devices. Alexa will check on your deliveries for you, pull up an app for you, and answer your questions very nicely for an air TV assistant. It looks through all your channels for your requests and is snappy. The HD is very nice on the fire stick,  and if you get discounts on channels through Prime like me the Stick is priceless.I'd also like to praise the game section of the device. Very well played by the developers and you will love playing app multi player games with family and they have some retro games in their collection too. It brings the idea of an entertainment device to life, and I find that this is a sincerely innovative way to use their integrated memberships and technology. This is the future of streaming as we know it.My only qualm with it is I can't connect to my cable app yet and a few other things aren't compatible yet. If I could do that,  being a Prime enthusiast, I might switch to Fire TV. I was sincerely skeptical, obviously, as this was a mistaken purchase, but I'm super pleased with how this handles. All the stuff you can do on Roku for the most part can be done on the new Fire TV. Plex included. Everything but connect to Spectrum.I love how Alexa can play music for you and will bring up music right away, open apps, and make television, movies, games, and all things entertainment just that much easier.Being snappy, beautifully designed, and cost efficient makes this a no brainer buy for the Prime Subscribed family. Search titles in record time! Enjoy beautifully rendered games, Amazon Photo integration, and more.The qualms I have with the stick is it is micro usb powered, isn't compatible with important stuff, and can sometimes be a little bit crazy to navigate manually but these are really small complaints.Give it a try, I did, and I think you will love it too! Love it enough to ditch the other sticks? Only you can decide that one."
"2864","I purchased my fire stick Saturday, got it yesterday and I love it! Everything runs smoothly and it was very easy to set up. I have everything pictured except the fire stick. I forgot to get it out of the box before the picture. Lol"
"2865","LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE .. did I mention I LOVE this?  Goodbye high cable bill. Easy peasy to install - I am extremely technically impaired and I was able to do the installation on my own with NO problems. Alexa voice remote is sweet - just tell her what you want to watch and BAM, you're their."
"2866","So far so good. We had he older model and upgraded. I don't use the voice command very often but I love the fire! Works and does exactly what I need it to do. Very convenient"
"2867","Very happy with my purchase.  The Fire TV stick was very easy to install and super easy to use with Alexa voice control.  Along with my Prime membership I'm now able to watch many of the programs I enjoy along with listening to the Prim music channel."
"2868","The best investment I've made in a long time, I'm saving so much money on my monthly cable bill.I've recommended this to a few friends and they are happy about their purchase"
"2869","My family and I recently 'ditched the dish' and turned to steaming for all our TV needs. We have previously owned Rokus and Apple TVs - that being said, after testing the water with the Amazon FireStick, we were so pleased we went back for two of the large Fire TV devices and several Fire Sticks (we donated the Rokus). We upgraded to the larger Fire devices for our two Ultra HD televisions, but now have 4 Firesticks on the others - the only difference besides storage is that Firesticks do not have Ultra HD, but if you have a regular HD flatscreen, you won't see a difference. Of the three major devices (including Apple), my family and I found the interface of the Amazon Fire to be the most user friendly, easiest to navigate, and really love the remote. The remote is that perfect middle ground between the comfort of an old fashioned TV remote and the new technologies thanks to Alexa speech being available and smaller size. We now use the Sling app for our live TV and really enjoy how it's interface works with Amazon Fire versus the Apple. Just to be clear, Apple is still good (especially if you are heavily invested in movies/tv shows with them), but for overall ease of use, we have come to rely on Amazon Fire when using Prime, Netflix and Sling. So if you are new to streaming your live TV or do not use Apple (or even if you do, the more the merrier) or want to get a device for a technological newbie that is easy to set up and use right out of the box, I HIGHLY recommend both Amazon Fire devices! A five star device - well done Amazon!!!"
"2870","We loved this for the first few months but now that the remote has stopped working and we can't use it anymore, not so much. We've tried 3 different sets of batteries and the remote no longer works. Very disappointed."
"2871","My whole family loves the Amazon Fire Stick !!!!!We have now cut the cable.  No more cable TV.  No more satellite TV.I have been introducing it to others.  They love it too."
"2872","Was using my TV to access amazon and Netflix... needless to say I experienced near unending problems.... this fixes all that, works well, is simple to use. I should have bought it sooner!"
"2873","Love it! I have only antenna tv, with no cable subscription except for Netflix. I was hesitant to purchase the Fire TV Stick merely to watch Netflix on my television.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I have access to much more free streaming AND games.  Now, I am not fond of manually sifting through all the pay-for-view options just to find what I can watch for free, but the Alexa voice control takes care of that.  And, Alexa finds what I'm looking for very quickly. Quite pleased with the value for the price."
"2874","Great for streaming movies or music from Amazon Prime. I have yet to try any other apps as I have a metered data account; No Cable or Fios in my rural area. Amazon's Fire stick technology does an awesome job with keeping my data use under control."
"2875","Plug it in and begin - that easy. Voice remote works just fine - from my sofa.  Good options, for someone who doesn't need a full line to channels.  Great price.  I'm satisfied."
"2876","We now have a Fire TV Stick for every TV in our home.  It makes it so easy to access all our content in one place - Netflix, Hulu, CBS All Access, YouTube, etc.  Love my Fire TV!!"
"2877","I'm using it while under a free trial with Prime.  Not sure how much use it will have once I am not longer a prime member.Very convenient and great while a prime member."
"2878","The Fire TV Stick is amazing! I use it for Netflix and Hulu mainly, but I can also use it to play music and basic games on the TV (GREAT for kids). It's easy to set up with your home wifi and the HD quality is amazing. We have a large smart HDTV and the quality from the TV stick is as good or better than that of HD cable channels. Get this if you have a TV in your house!"
"2879","I'm amazed at how fast this thing is especially for its size. The voice controlled remote is very handy, and I liked getting the discount when its paired with an Echo Dot."
"2880","The fire stick is great, very portable and super simple to setup. I use it in my garage gym and will take it along when we go on vacation.I would easily give the product 5 stars, but I will say that the shipping time was disappointing. This product as listed as Prime with Free 2-day shipping for Amazon Prime members, however I placed my order on February 18th and did not receive it until March 1st. Not sure what value Prime has if it takes nearly two weeks to receive and item shipped 2-day."
"2881","It best the decision I had made.  First by cutting the cable cord and I am enjoying all the the movies any my television shows without the high cost of  a cable bill. Yes I highly recommend  the Fire TV Stick with Alexa and you  will not be sorry you bought it. :)"
"2882","Does it ALL!Yes, it really works I'm still exploring all it does you really need a prime membership to ""have it all"" but it's well with it.enough said."
"2883","It is absolutely unbelivable at the amount of movies and TV shows that are available to watch using this tiny little device. I am very satisfied with this seller and item."
"2884","I love love love my fire stick! I use it nearly every day and its amazing."
"2885","Just received today.  Easy to set up, I like the voice remote, and so far it works well.  Only downside is I may have inadvertently signed up for HBO.  Guess I'll find out!"
"2886","Great if you have the other apps that you pay for, but otherwise, does not bring nothing new you can do with a pc connected to tv. It is convenient with the voice commands."
"2887","Hooked this up with the 35 mile antenna, had 28 local channels with a very good picture. Channels and music galore on the fire TV. Did away with my expensive and ugly cable box in my bedroom. To date I have not had any glitches with this product, only problem I've had is when my wireless router is acting up and I loose wifi to the fire stick. Eventually when I can give up my need to have cable in my house I will do away with cable in my living room and purchase another fire stick. BEST INVENTION EVER, well beside penicillin of course. Cheers"
"2888","Product arrived when they said it would, was extremely easy to connect to the TV, and because I purchased this with my Amazon account I didn't have a lot of setup to do.  All I had to do was add the Playstation Vue app and I was done and streaming TV.  I love it and highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a TV Streaming device.  The price alone makes it impossible to not recommend this device."
"2889","This product,  coupled with Amazon Prime and ALEXA VOICE will give you the best ""bang for your buck"" than any other service/item available to you via the World Wide Web. I really enjoy viewing the many shows, movies etc.,etc.that are coupled to this service."
"2890","Turned my flat-screen TV into a smart TV with Alexa!  All for about $39!This is a fabulous deal.  Now I have access to Amazon movies on my ""regular"" TV."
"2891","The newest model as of this date is super fast and stupidly easy to set up.  Seriously, you plug it in, watch the intro while it sets itself up, and you are good to go.  As long as you remember your Wi-Fi password :)No loading issues, no hang ups, no connection issues, and the remote works fast and well either with or without voice input.Pair this fire stick with Prime/Netflix for optimum results."
"2892","I wish I could still return it but I put it in a box while going through a move before final utilizing it months later. I lose connectivity all the time. I have to get up and unplug the device to force it to reboot and reconnect. I do not have any problems with my internet service or wifi at home. I hate this device and regret purchasing it."
"2893","Device works amazingly! Wi-fi Connection strength is Awesome! no cut-outs, no loss of connection or stuttering of streamed videos. Could use a little better menu functioning for searching for Prime movies / videos (such as searching for categories  / genre's instead of only titles.) Voice control of the remote functions perfectly. Price is affordable and well worth the purchase. remote control and menu's are very easy to understand and use. Overall great purchase!"
"2894","Bought this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it. It's easy to use for her and very responsive. I had to help her set it up because she is not tech savvy but after set up she has no problem. I have the last generation and this one is faster. Thinking of getting myself a new one!"
"2895","I love the features that come with the fire stick and how easy it is to start streaming! The lower rating is due to my disappointment with the remote. It work sporadically and is very frustrating. Sometimes it will not for to control the stick for 2 or more minutes. Then it may work for a few minutes (or hours) before going through everything again. I never have to pair it again, and I don't notice any freezing with the tv when it happens. I'm wondering if our remote is defected?"
"2896","I had difficulty setting it up because I didn't plug the cord into a dedicated outlet.I Once I did that, it was just plug & play. It did not work plugged into my surge protector. I love it, Alexa is very cool, you just have to speak and hold the microphone icon down.  It is very responsive and had no trouble understanding my prompts."
"2897","We love it, using Prime and Netflix we will be ditching our cable service and saving $$$. We also purchased so that we can take advantage of WIFI while we travel and have the same benefits as home in our trailer. When we travel we shut down all but the minimum to keep our wifi provider account open which saves us even more. The unit works as advertised, and using prime we have access to some great free programming. We were going to have Prime for shipping anyway. It is time to cut Cable TV out for us."
"2898","I bought the Fire Stick to turn a slightly older TV into a smart TV. I couldn't really get it to work until I became an Amazon Prime member. So I guess I would say so far it's done Amazon more good than me. None the less, I think I like it. As I learn it's finer points, will probably like it better (a little tech challenged). At the very least, Amazon Prime Is another version of Netflix for me and it comes with free shipping so what the heck. Already binge watched a bunch of HBO's Rome. So...I guess I'm saying I am pretty happy."
"2899","It is so simple to hook up and with all the free apps we have not needed to purchase anything extra. Love this we wish we had done this much sooner and kicked Dish TV to the curb and put that money in our pocket."
"2900","Its tricky for a senior... my mom uses it and the voice recognition is ok.  But brings up results that don't really mesh w what she wants.  Songs instead of music...stuff like that."
"2901","This is the best way to stream amazon prime videos, however it's frustrating for searching other places sometimes.  We pay extra for stars through amazon prime and you can search through the regular methods. It will try to get you to buy stuff you can watch for free through the stars subscription. Hopefully that will be fixed, i have seen a couple of things that the amazon search directs you even to other apps like netflix or hulu, but not all. But the stars stuff should definitely auto direct since we're paying through Amazon"
"2902","I have the latest Apple TV and I thought I would give this a try. Unfortunately it freezes on me often, I have to restart it at least once a day, it's a little jittery and the screen will hesitate frequently, once again I have to restart it.  I decided to keep it since I just opened up on Amazon Prime account, however I really love my AppleTV everything is a lot smoother and I don't have those type of problems that I do with the new Fire Stick.  For now I just restarted at least once a day to minimize the issues I'm having."
"2903","Where do I even begin? Amazon never ceases to amaze me with their electronic products. I am a big techie and always interested in the latest gadgets. I have a fire stick for all of my TVs in my house and I absolutely love them! I have the original fire stick without the Voice Remote in one room, and another with the Alexa Voice Remote in another. I love having the option of the Voice Remote as it is incredible with voice recognition and understanding what you are saying. Wonderful product and the ease of use is a huge plus!"
"2904","I highly recommend the Amazon Fire TV stick. This product is easy to use, gets great reception. It's always a clear picture, and it's remote doesn't cut out if you are to far away from the tv. I have never had it disconnect and it always is so fast. I absolutely love my Amazon Fire TV stick. I use it to order pizza,call an Uber, watch Netflix, Hulu, and even check the weather. I am highly satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone. I love how easy it is to use and set up. It has easily been worth every penny in my opinion!"
"2905","I like this Fire Stick way better than the first one. My remote stopped working for the first one for no reason. Amazon was kind enough to to offer a discount on the purchase of this one. Thanks Amazon for knowing how to treat your customer's!"
"2906","Love it.  Will probably be one for every TV we own at some point.  We have 2 of them now and they are quite functional.  The only issue we have is there is not VUDU compatibility."
"2907","Well I have only had it for about a week now. Really I haven't had time to get to know it. As much that I have it's great. Now it's just having my fiancé agree. I want to cancel my cable :(...  For the price it's great. I need to order another on HD, because the channels on the regular one are dark and it's not HD."
"2908","I've been using my Samsung smart tv apps for the past few months. Previously I have used Roku. With the Fire stick, I get all my Prime movies and music, Hulu and Netflix. It's super easy to use, so much so my 5 year old twin boys are now pro's after unboxing just 2 hours ago. The Hulu Live option being available on the Fire stick was my main motivation. We.are.thrilled."
"2909","Excellent product.. I don't use the voice commands as much as I thought I would, but they are responsive and accurate.  I had the previous model and was hoping for a little more speed in launching and running apps.  I use it primarily for playstation vue and it does the trick, just not the super speed I was expecting, but nevertheless it's still faster than the old model.Great device to make any TV even smarter, amazon prime members will love it.. I listen to prime music, look at my pictures through it, play games etc."
"2910","Works perfectly.  Purchased one for master bedroom and use the firestick remote for operation.  Other one is used in living room and the TV Universal Remote operates the firestick and also the TV antenna channels.  You can also remove the firestick from one TV and use on another TV (eg guest room) and all settings are retained."
"2911","It worked as advertised . I would have given it a 5 star but it quit working and I have not gotten it to come back . It appears to not have any internal workings as it will not show up on my computer as a device. It will not work with the power or without the power source. I have not contacted Amazon yet on the return but will."
"2912","This thing is THE BEST bang for your buck! It's so easy to navigate and if your an Amazon prime member you get a major bonus of free shows and movies! One of my favorite purchases I've made."
"2913","great device, the use of the lengthen adapter is a MUSTsince i have the plug a bit away from the device, the power cable remained tense and caused the hdmi output to be unsoldered from the main board of the fire tv.my fault, just make sure the AC power remains loose or you will soon ruin the device."
"2914","l love, love the fire stick.  It's easy to install and operate.  With Prime membership, your viewing and purchasing options are unlimited.  This is definitely a must have."
"2915","Right product, Right price."
"2916","It works ok but not as good as Roku.  I cannot get it to connect to a hidden network but my Roku connects without any problems. The Roku menu is more user friendly as well."
"2917","I received it on time I haven't hooked it up yet I had to get a friend to set it up for me so I can't see how well it works yet because I haven't got a working on my TV yet"
"2918","OK product. I expected better but it froze on me the other day and I couldn't access Netflix so I had to resort to using the Netflix app that came built into my Vizio TV."
"2919","I'm not a cord cutter but this is nice for times when you want to watch something besides what is NOT on cable. And you can install some other apps to get more out of it."
"2920","Voice control is often unresponsive or laggy. Doesn't work in other applications so you're forced to type out using the menu buttons. Other than that, works great. I highly recommend."
"2921","I thought the fire stick would do more for me, but the problem is really not with the fire stick.  The problem lies with my TV.  I was sold a tv that was labeled as a smart tv.  It turns out that the tv was not as advertised, so the fire stick is limited in its capabilities on my tv.  I called to complain, but I waited to long for anything to be done to compensate me.  That being said, I will be returning the fire stick back to the store."
"2922","I love the Fire TV Stick, especially the voice remote feature.  All of this technology is pretty new to me so I'm not sure if I understand everything that I can do to make full use of the TV stick.  If we didn't have Amazon Prime I wondered if we would be able to use anything on the Fire TV Stick without being charged a fee since I noticed almost everything has a fee.  I did like seeing that there is a nice selection of family type movies that can be viewed."
"2923","Really enjoy this thing, we no longer pay for cable and rely solely on the firestick and fire tv. If you have the money to spend I suggest purchasing The fire tv, loads much faster and has a better connection in general. But essentially they both do the same thing."
"2924","I love fire sticks, but I am very disappointed with this model. The voice control is very low-quality and often doesn't work.  Just get a regular one and save some money!"
"2925","Its good to convert ordinary Tv to a smart tv. The drawback is that you can't cast your browser tabs like you can in chromecast. It should be an easy fix for people in Amazon if they want to."
"2926","Price was good. Streams well. Responds moderately promptly to commands. Doesn't support all the features it's supposed to (setting up with the alexa app, certain voice functions, etc.). Should support more of the common entertainment apps like AMC. Doesn't have a comprehensive troubleshooting protocol that's easy to access (if it exists.. Still haven't gotten certain things figured out).Even with its issues, I'd recommend it to others for the same (cyber monday) price I paid for their basic entertainment needs."
"2927","Allowed me to watch Amazon on my den TV. Easy to install. Multiple function remote works Easyer and faster than ""casting "" from my smart phone for each premium channels"
"2928","Bought for me as a Mother's gift, it ushered me into my ""Cut the Cord"" phase, and I'm loving it!  With many different apps to choose from, you won't miss cable one bit!"
"2929","Super easy set up! Love it with my ECHO! Can’t wait to see all the available stuff to watch!Just tons of apps that go thru and I am also Prime member! I will be very busy! Check back with me in a year! Lol"
"2930","We love this Fire TV Stick. I had read some reviews that it was not easy to install. That certainly was not the case it was as easy as one two three. I highly recommend it."
"2931","I bought this device in Jan. 2017, 100 days ago. It stopped working last nite, trouble shot with the help section no luck. Called and got tech. support, no help. There conclusion was it is broken, at first they were not going to do anything because I was 10 days past the warranty time . After talking to a supervisor Ms. Caroline, she gave me a full credit for the device and was very nice. The customer support was just perfect. I thank Amazon for the way they handled this."
"2932","I was disappointed with this. Then I factory reset, that fixed all lag and not loading apps. Now, I love it as much as my original one. If your Firestick is laggy or not loading apps properly. Factory reset it. It fixed mine."
"2933","Best ever. I have it in my home office and use it everyday to stream movies. I always have a movie on while working. Super easy to use. I love the Alexa feature. My go to is, “Alexa, open Shudder.”  You have got to get the add-on for the Shudder channel if you love horror movies. I love that I also can use HBO on it too. I just sign in with my DIRECTV account and boom HBO. Easy Peasy."
"2934","Easy set up, user friendly."
"2935","I have this Fire TV stick and the one they made before the Alexa voice was added to it. I love them both. I like them better than the Roku because you have more options with these. I never use the Alexa voice thing."
"2936","I’m very pleased with my Fire TV Stick. I use it everyday to watch series on Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime. I love all of the apps that are available. I highly recommend it."
"2937","Replaced the original fire stick  ...WOW!  . . . . this new one with voice activation is GREAT.  Works great with my non-smart TV and the Amazon Prime Shows are also very good.  I highly recommend this unit."
"2938","We love the Fire Stick! We cut cable over a year ago, and we were getting by with Netflix and Amazon Prime on tablets and one smart TV. Signed up for Hulu and bought a fire stick, and that’s opened up a whole new world of things for us to watch.We were looking at buying a new smart TV, and I realized a fire stick would accomplish the same thing with our existing TV’s. Loved it so much, we bought a second stick for another TV."
"2939","The show selection is good, but while watching shows or movies, there's a lag between the audio & video, where the characters mouths are not moving in sync with the sound of their voices. It's annoying & I'm not sure I'm altogether pleased with the purchase because if this. I am considering returning it because if this. I'm not sure if there a troubleshoot for this problem but haven't had time to look because I've been working overtime since I've gotten it."
"2940","Well, after 3 months my firestick stop working, called customer service && they informed me that the warranty on the device expires after 90 days so I will have to buy a new one all over again, but they did say, ""instead of paying $39.99, you will only pay $29 for a new one, you'll get $10 off"" but they won't be in stock until the 6th of April... Way to go Amazon, way to go... I can't deny that it is a WONDERFUL investment, only if they made/built them to last..."
"2941","I  absolutely recommend anyone who's on fix income to purchase this cable is wayyyy to expensive this is better than cable.Im in love with my fire stick omg I love it.Don't hesitate purchase purchase purchase you'll fall in love with it.It takes some getting use to as far as finding your stations movies etc you have to set it up to personalize your likes and your family likes after you do that I promise you you're going to be in love.I love it mad I waited this long to get one."
"2942","I can't say enough good things about my Firestick.  I stopped being a cable subscriber years ago and the plentiful Apps on the Firestick makes it easy to stay entertained."
"2943","Don't like the fact you can't turn it off by remote control. Stays on all the time. If you have people in your household that are not tech savvy they will let some videos stream on and on. The other undesirable is lack of streaming local home made videos from your PC (I know you can download apps in your fire stick and PC, but that is not attractive. I had another brand media streamer that could stream internet and local PC just fine. Except it was getting old and did not have wireless connection. Oh well, I will survive."
"2944","This is an excellent device that provides a seemingly endless amount of entertainment.My only gripes about the device:1)  I wish volume buttons were built into the remote, or a volume control icon displayed while viewing videos.2) There is perfectly good voice recognition software built into the remote, but you can't use it for voice-to-text inside of applications.  This can be tiresome when you have to manually type in long searches.Other than that, I believe it is well worth the cost."
"2945","Device works well, interface is pretty snappy. The remote is just OK in terms of quality, but to keep costs down I get it. You don't need anything great. The voice capture on it is pretty good. As a side note for those wondering how it compares to the Apple TV (4th gen), the interface on Apple TV is snappier and the remote with audio capture are top notch and better than this Fire TV stick. However, the Fire TV stick is a fraction of the price and I think in terms of quality vs. price it is probably a better overall deal."
"2946","Great streaming device. I replaced my roku and chromcasr with the amazon fire stick and havent turned back. The only thing that i found disappointing was that I cannot control my echo with alexa on the remote. Even when connecting them via Bluetooth, I cannot use the firestick to say skip a song I am playing on my echo. I feel that was a missed opportunity for integration across Amazon devices. My fault for making the assumption they would be fully integrated. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a streaming device."
"2947","We bought a Fire TV Stick for a new-to-us TV for our bedroom (we have a first gen Apple TV box on our main TV). I'm very happy with it, and I wish I'd bought one sooner."
"2948","Absolutely think this version of the Fire TV stick is great - a big improvement over previous versions with better WiFi sensitivity than the others ones I already owned."
"2949","Very easy to install, very easy to use. I don't use it very often, but it's good. And it's an improvement over trying to stream with the old DVD player, that's for sure."
"2950","The upgrade from my Roku 2 to the Alexa Firestick brought great graphic displays for Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime as well as the other channels. Simple to use and setup. However what is really cool is I ask Alexa to play i.e. Zac Brown band while viewing movie selection. Awesome fun product."
"2951","Fire TV Stick is the only was to watch TV. All of your cable channels and streaming is all there. Excellent High Def channels for excellent quality movies are all there."
"2952","The batteries on the remote seem to die quickly, but it might be because I carry it around with me sometimes, so maybe something is pressing buttons in my bag. The phone app works great to control it though. Also great if someone only has SD cable, because I just plug this in and run tv apps so we can watch in HD."
"2953","Works well. The only way to view Amazon is through thus unit because for some reason cable tv does not have that as a selection. They have every video except for Amazon."
"2954","Awesome! We bought this for an older HD TV we have in our bedroom that is not a smart tv and we are very pleased with it. Has all of the major streaming apps and everything works and runs quick and smooth. Basically turns your older TV into a smart TV. we love it."
"2955","Got this as a gift for my parents. Set it up, watching shows but Alexa still doesn't recognize anyone's voice to find shows. At least they are using it with relative ease."
"2956","For the price, to be fair, I have nothing to say but to give it a 5 star.There are small things like no bluetooth connectivity or 'airplay' but hey, the price is insane. There's nothing you can complain about. Its great."
"2957","I am still learning to use the Firestick, but first impression is one of disappointment. The remote will only work if the back is off. The ads of all the stations available is misleading. Yes, you can get them, but for the same fee you would pay if you subscribed independently. I am hoping the more I explore over the fall, the more I will like it. Right now, I would not buy it again."
"2958","I wish that Alexa was more like Siri ...Alexa cannot access google, so when I ask her a question if it's not in Wikepedia she can't answer it.  Amazon, you have a great potential here.  Besides finding movies (which she does very well!) I could see this being a tool to help with a foreign language or answer any question one might have.I don't like having to push the button to ask a question.  Why can't we get the attention of Alexa by having a code word.I definitely think it has more options than Chromcast."
"2959","Don't have cable and wanted to watch Netflix/Hulu/Prime in my room and play music while I clean so for my purposes the Fire Stick is perfect. I have flawless internet connection, its easy to navigate, and I like the Alexa voice remote, especially for asking the weather in the morning! Compared to the Roku, which my family put in the living room, I prefer the way the Fire Stick home screen looks/is set up, but that is a minor preference."
"2960","I used to pay 50 dollars a month and only watched a few channels namely ESPN, I decided to cut the cable but my husband really missed the ESPN. I decided to give this a try along with $20 a month Sling Internet TV and BOOM! I have all my favorite channels back plus PRIME movies. ESPN, TNT, Food Network, Travel TV works great, I get great HD quality and just with Prime and Sling I have so much selection, I basically save $30 a month and get even better quality HD. It's SO easy to set up and the Alexa remote is really easy to use and smart."
"2961","After using the Fire stick I have a question...aIs a new remote with ""more"" controls in the works. Currently the remote that we are using is to ""simple"". Even with the tutorials that are available we are still having to ""guess"" what each button or feature will perform when you make a selection. We enjoy the channel selection but frequently stations are unavailable due to technical problems. Tech support is available when only a small delay in reaching a representative."
"2962","Had really high expectations for this product. I've had a roku for a long time and decided to switch to the fire stick. It's loading time is terrible, and most of the apps I've downloaded don't seem to work well with it either.  I've had it for a week and I've already had to reboot it 4 times for freezing. It's not my internet or internet speed because I have iPhones, iPads and computers all running fine wth no lag. I purchased this as an option instead of getting cable, but it's definitely making me rethink my decision."
"2963","After experiencing free Wi-Fi for so long I was surprised by the web of costs for programs (although it made sense when I thought about it), but most frustrating was that it has taken several days to get audio to work for longer than a couple of minutes. Nothing online was helpful. I finally moved the device from the HDMI3 port on my television to the HDMI2 port and was able to watch (and hear) an entire show last night. If that was the fix then this will be an incredible device. My time with satellite TV is almost over."
"2964","A friend told me about this -- she had received it from her son-in-law at Christmas and and it sounded too good to be true. But, I was already a Prime member and it was only $39.99 so I decided to take a chance. I have an Amazon Echo which I love and now the Alexa remote looks up my choices on TV for me. There is enough content to last me the rest of my life! I don't need to get DVD's at Redbox or wait weeks for the DVD's I requested at the library to come in. The only downside is that I will be watching way too much TV."
"2965","Not especially cool. Have never liked the way Amazon sorts it's movies and with the Fire Stick, it seems even more limited. Wish there was a way to go outside Amazon onto the web to pull in other movie sites. I have a stand alone Gaia subscription and cannot watch it through my Amazon connection without buying an additional license. I understand the need for Amazon to get their piece of the pie but my outside subscription costs the same and is already paid for. They should make it available as a purchasing user of Amazon"
"2966","I like how I can ask it to do something and it does. No need to fumble around. I am still trying to figure out all of the apps and all. But it is a handy item for your TV!"
"2967","I have had the fire stick for a little over a month now.  Really like the options to watch whatever I want and not really need cable. Wish I can watch more live TV but I canceled my cable and I'm strictly on the fire stick and I am satisfied"
"2968","If you're wondering if Kodi runs well on this device, the answer is yes! Not only does it run amazingly well, it's also super easy to install. Ever since receiving my first stick, we have since turned off our cable service and couldn't be happier! If you're reading this and don't understand what Kodi is, then a quick Google search will answer any and all questions that you may have :)"
"2969","Every once in awhile the remote freezes or hangs. We thought perhaps the batteries were dying even though the purchase was less than a month old. We changed out the batteries but it still has done this on occasion."
"2970","So far so good!!!  The Fire Stick has been everything it was advertised to be.  The voice controlled remote was a cool addition as well.  This was money VERY well spent!!"
"2971","Love this product.Had a little trouble at first  but amazon is the greatest to fix it and make you a happy camper.very recommend  to all. STICK WITH AMAZON great company."
"2972","I've had the most success with the Firestick. Apps run smoothly and fast. I don't have to use another device to stream to the firestick but I can. No issues with lag or stuttering."
"2973","I've used the previous generation of the fire stick for a long time. It has been great. I have a vizio smart tv, but the apps are terribly slow, so I use the fire stick instead. Next time I'm going to save some money and buy a non-smart tv and just use the fire stick. This next generation stick is better than the previous one in a couple of ways: 1) it is noticibly faster. I bought it for that reason, knowing that it had a better processor in it, and I'm happy that I can see the difference. If you use just netflix, then you probably won't notice a difference in speed, because the netflix app works very quickly no matter what. But I got this generation fire stick hoping that it will speed up the PlayStation Vue app. This live TV streaming and DVR app is great, and far better than using Sling TV, but it does draft only in the selection process of flipping around to find a show to watch, once you're watching a show there was no problem. This new generation of the stick diffenitely handles the PlayStation Vue app much better, and that's exactly the reason why I bought the new one to replace my old, so I am happy. 2) Also my opinion is that the new remote is much better than the previous one. Amazon seemed to listen to my (and others) survey about the old fire stick, about how small the old remote was. It would just slip out of your hands, and it was the perfect size to slip through the couch. I have fished that thing out so many times. I know what Amazon was thinking: everybody wants smaller devices now. But too small becomes ineffective. One time I lost that tiny remote for several months and didn't find it until we moved (during that time I used the fire app on my phone to operate the stick). So all in all, this fire stick is well worth it for anyone who wants to convert their tv to a smart tv, or who wants to use this instead of poorly made smart tv apps."
"2974","Love it very simple to install"
"2975","I love it! I was amazed at how simple it was to install and set up! I am a technically challenged retired grandma and was so proud that I did it myself! I have Amazon Prime so I now have more selections than I have time to watch. And the remote is super simple to operate. Very happy customer!"
"2976","They took away the feature to calibrate display (scaling). For our old Apex 1080p 40"" LCD this is a deal breaker, because it inherently has overlap that cannot be adjusted."
"2977","Overall, the fire stick is fantastic.  My complaint is specific to the remote.  It constantly freezes up and I have to take the battery's out and put them back in to unfreeze it.  It happens probably twice a week.  Not sure if it is a design flaw or just mine but figured I'd put it out there."
"2978","I am one of the unlucky ones that does not have the zoom setting on my tv. The whole thing is about an inch larger than my tv and there is no way to fix it since my tv does not have the setting. I cannot tell the time stamps on the videos since they are cut off, but that is more of an inconvenience than an actual problem. I wish there was a setting to make the screen smaller on the player, kinda like how the PS4 does.Other than that, the thing is a godsend! For the last few years, I have been screen mirroring from my Samsung to my tv and using my phone to watch everything, but I am unable to use my phone at the same time. With this, I can download all the same programs (Kodi & Showbox) and I am able to watch all the same stuff as I was before without having to give up my phone.It is a little slow sometimes and sometimes it just goes back to the main home screen when I am in the middle of looking through movies or whatever, but after I reset the stick it doesn't do it again.  (reset pressing and holding the ""home"" button and the ""select"" middle button)I also haven't had much luck with the voice part unless I am just opening a known app (like ""Open Netflix"" or watching something from the Amazon Video player. I tried to fast forward during a Netflix show with the voice and it did not work at all. (That could totally be user error and if anyone knows what I am doing wrong, a comment would be greatly appreciated)."
"2979","Absolutely love my fire stick.  My husband doesn't usually get too impressed with much of anything, and even he grabs for the fire stick remote as soon as he gets home."
"2980","We have been having issues with the Amazon fire remote working, the remote came with Amazon batteries and replaced them with Duracell batteries thinking maybe that was the issue but it still is not working, we have been hearing of others having the same issue and troubleshooting to fix the issue but we have not had such luck."
"2981","I like it very well.  Haven't gotten totally used to it, but it seems easy to operate.  Wanted to pull up movies by year but still haven't found out how or if possible."
"2982","Really love my fire tv. Easy install and setup. I was watching movies in no time. I had to use the hdmi extender in order to install the stick but it works seamlessly. I have watched amazon video and Netflix so far.  Amazon delivered in 2days as promised."
"2983","I wish I would've bought one sooner. There are soooo many movies and tv shows available on prime. The streaming is smooth and the picture is crispy. I'm still a chromecast fan but the fire tv stick is on another level."
"2984","I am pretty happy with the Fire TV Stick.  Installation was a bit of a bear but there are plenty of troubleshooting tips on the internet that were very helpful.  After installing the third one I was an expert.  I do not miss my cable tv bill at all, although I did keep my broadband internet.  There are so many options for streaming tv and more popping up every day.  I have Netflix and Sling TV, they work great.  I have not had to upgrade my router, was worried about that but so far it is working fine with the streaming tv."
"2985","I love the Amazon Fire TV Stick.  Actually WE (my son & I) do.  I just ordered and got delivered the second stick for our house.  I'm very excited about dropping cable tv and making the switch to this.  As far as I can tell, I have access to everything I used to watch and things I've always wanted to watch and I'm still paying less money than I was to cable even with subscriptions to Netflix, Amazon & Hulu!  <3 <3 <3  Hopefully the set up with the second stick will be as effortless and painless as the first!"
"2986","Have 3.  Replaced the Roku.  The only thing i do not like is that when you leave a section it starts back at the beginning which is a nuisance.  Could possibly be user error as it doesn't make sense."
"2987","Super easy to use.  Love using it with our projector for outside movies.  Brought with us on a trip and other than some buffering (due to the hotel WiFi) it worked great."
"2988","I got this for my sister for Christmas and she loves it! I helped her install it and showed her the basics and she thinks it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. It was really easy to set up and use. She's had no issues with any lagging or buffering like I've seen with some other streaming devices (I work at IT on a college campus and we have students struggling with streaming devices all of the time).I would definitely recommend this to other friends or family when they ask which device they should invest in."
"2989","Greatest ever!  I'm getting my Dad one and shutting cable off!"
"2990","Love the Fire Stick! I bought another one already! My husband just took it to his parents to watch sports and all he had to do was reset the wifi password and it connected right away. Very user friendly, rarely buffers, great picture!"
"2991","It's great and I love that I can get my Beachbody on Demand in the basement where I don't have a cable box or a smart TV!"
"2992","Not as easy to use as I had hoped. My husband has traumatic brain injury so having to switch controls and from TV to HDMI is hard for him. Reception is very good though and transmits a nice sharp image."
"2993","OMG! The most amazing piece of entertainment technology you will ever own!Easy set up and you'll be watching your HD movies and shows within minutes... maybe less!"
"2994","If your looking to make your old tv smart this is the wa to go ! Works great and easy to setup and run , couldn't ask for a better piece of equipment. Get yours today you won't be disappointed , I would recomend it to everyone !"
"2995","I have a ROKU and needed a streaming stick for a different room and While I love the interface and ease to access Amazon Prime shows, Netflix, Sling and others. It does not have all the options for channels that ROKU has, in particular TWC TV, which is the Time Warner Cable subscriber streaming channel. It makes it nice to not have to have a cable box on the TV's you have a ROKU or Fire Stick. If not for that it would get 5 stars! Oh, the first one I received was a dead stick, but Amazon replaced quickly and efficiently."
"2996","Revolutionary stuff. I upgraded my in-laws entertainment system with this thing and they love it. Easy to install (I opted for the HDMI input on the rear of the AVR with no problems). Up and running in 3 minutes flat. Terrific voice dictation too!"
"2997","2nd purchase.  This one is for a Christmas gift.  I've been using mine for a year and it's the best thing since sliced bread for streaming Netflix or Amazon movies.  I've even set it up to stream movies I have stored on my PC.  Also love streaming internet radio through my surround sound system. I absolutely love this thing."
"2998","My first stick is my go-to in the evenings when I'm looking for something to watch. It is easy to use and the Alexa Voice is great. You don't have to spend a bunch of time searching for a movie or series. LOVE IT."
"2999","I've had this fire stick tv for 2 weeks, and it has been wonderful to me. Easy to install, set up. Wonderful! The only reason it is 4 and not 5 stars is because you have to use the television speakers. I was wary after reading some reviews, but thought ""what could it hurt?"". I'm glad I did now, because it goes with me everywhere."
"3000","I am new to the whole FireStick thing, but it works fine. My TV is about 20 feet from the router, so picking up signal is no problem. I am using for Sling, YouTube, and Crackle. With this and my new over the air antenna, I cut the cord and really don't miss cable at all."
"3001","I suggest getting the fire tv over this unit - maybe for travel this unit would be good but its much slower and it bogs down the wifi a lot more than the fire tv I have."
"3002","I have had every FireTV device, and of all the sticks I've had, the new FireStick is the winner. The major improvement being the wifi. It used to be a struggle to reach my bedroom through wifi. With and without the hdmi extension wifi signal would be spotty at best. Those days are long gone now. Buffering is faster, video flows smoothly and the voice controller has always been awesome. For those that want to know, this stick is slightly larger than it's predecessors, still portable but now has nearly the same footprint as my iMito MX1."
"3003","You guys are way better than cable and the stakes phenomenal I have two of them every TV I get I'm going to get one these things are great people you don't know what you're missing you don't need cable you got this you can watch anything love it 20 Stars"
"3004","Love getting my Orlando local channels, not available on Dish. Dish makes me go with Tampa which is 65 miles from home and Orlando is 30, but Polk County is tied to Tampa. Fire TV gets my Orlando Channels and is well worth the price I paid. Use it daily."
"3005","This is the only fire stick I have owned which I bought four for all our TV's.  One recommendation is get a blue tooth keypad with mouse instead of the factory remote."
"3006","Alot better then the original fire stick, my mom loves ""Alexa"" its like she has a little friend in the TV to tell her the weather and make program suggestions!"
"3007","Excellent expansion to your entertainment choices.As a Prime Member this bring a world of content.Some free other to pay for, but all in all a great value."
"3008","Put this in the living room now I have two and they are great. Never had a problem with the first and don't expect to have a problem with the second. 5 Stars for sure!"
"3009","I LOVE ❤️ AMAZON FIRE STICK!! BEST STREAMING STICK IN STREAMING TECHNOLOGY!!! I ESPECIALLY LOVE THE ALEXA VOICE ACTIVATED REMOTE!!! EASY INSTALLATION, EASY SET UP AND EASY USE!! FAR BETTER THAN OTHER STREAMING STICKS."
"3010","Really fast access to shows with bigger selection of shows & games would have rated 5 stars. However, the remote freezes up & have to remove the batteries to reset it."
"3011","I dropped cable a few months ago & this is definitely a better choice! It's a little slower than the Fire Tv box but I would recommend this to anyone wanting something other than satellite or cable."
"3012","I now have 6 Fire sticks all setup on TVs at home and the river house. BrightHouse charges over $100 a month for the few channels we watch and the crap load we don't. I am cutting the cord to cable."
"3013","I finally cut my cable strings and started streaming.  So far, so good, with help from HULU NETFLIX and SLINGTV.  I'm slowly coming to appreciate the firestick.  Voice remote is great!!!"
"3014","I LOVE my fire stick.  I love it so much that I canceled my DirecTV package and I do not regret it one bit.  The only thing I miss about DIrecTV is the guide, but that is not enough to make me go back."
"3015","Up graded from the older firestick. Still have the other ,but the voice remote is the best. I have the new firestick in my room and the older one in the livingroom. They're working great. Thanks!"
"3016","I have two, one at home and one for the office. The one at home overheats easily, and the office reboots intermittently. Using both as XBMC, I'll just keep holding on to them, as currently those issues don't bother me too much."
"3017","Love the Fire TV stick!  Haven't had any problems with it.  It's so nice to be able to make any TV a smart TV.  Love the remote, too... so easy to find what you want!  It streams Netflix like a dream, though, we do have problems streaming some apps, like DirecTV and Plex.  My guess is that is back end server issues, though."
"3018","The remote itself is great. The biggest problem is the inability to easily add an actual keyboard so you don't have to move over letter at a time. A keyboard would make our phenomenal."
"3019","I love my fire stick! One of the best inventions ever! I use it all the time and it works great! On you're on the fence with purchasing one, don't be; it's worth every single dollar!!!"
"3020","I guess this is a great tool for someone who is computer and tech savvy.  I would like to have had more instructions on guidance with the device so I could take full advantage of all its features.  Right now I am feeling my way around and getting instructions from others who have come before me with this gadget and figured out all the ins and outs.  Great to have to cut down on cable but I still need to see the daily news in the morning and I haven't figured out how to do that yet.  Just got it so give me a minute :-)"
"3021","It works great...I got rid of cable....Cable sucks...they are the biggest rip off....This fire stick gets me the programming that I need"
"3022","I bought this to replace a WD -TV Live box that's about 5 years old. This really works quite well and was a nice upgrade. We mostly use it for Netflix. We have watched a things on Amazon Prime. Also, You-Tube works well and I could never get it to work on the WD-TV. If you want to ""Cut The Cable"" (and you should) this is a great way to do it. Believe me, if you get Netflix, Hulu, or A-Prime - just one of those - you will never run out of things to watch. Take the money you save on cable and put it into a 401K."
"3023","Fire Stick rocks !  The picture is so much clearer than my Sony blu ray player I had been using to watch Amazon and Netflix shows.  It's quicker, too.  And the voice remote makes finding a show very easy for this geezer.  Highly recommend."
"3024","Works very well I have no proablems with it I don't like the payment for some channels I'm a prime member I get good shows to watch the remote works great my favourite feature on the 🔥 stick great price too."
"3025","Bought this as a present for my girlfriend and she loves it. It's been incredibly simple to use, and the convenience of not having to plug the laptop into the TV (yes, our TV is old) is worth the price alone."
"3026","Totally worth it!Its so fun.I should have gotten the more expensive one if I didn't this was worth it.Amazon remote eats up the AAA battery like crazy and it does have some loading issues sometimes.For a cheap product, it feels really great"
"3027","I've used both the small and voice amazon remotes and although I don't use the the mic on the remote, just by design the voice remote feels superior.About the actual amazon stick, you can't go wrong, cut the cord with your cable provider and switch to higher internet speeds and enjoy the availability of streaming live or on demand video or music with your Amazon tv stick. Also research what additional apps you are able to obtain through web, I love this product."
"3028","Cancelled my cable.  Love Amazon. Watch my favorite shows and kids get to watch cartoons.  We can play games etc. so limitless what you can do with the fire stick.  Heaven sent."
"3029","Easy to jailbreak and get tons of free stuff, the interface and remote don't even compare to the Apple TV though.  AppleTV is much smoother, faster and better in every other way"
"3030","Both my husband and I really like this Amazon stick!  Great options to all the kids/family/couples movies we'd ever want!  Plus its easy to use!Thanks a bunches!"
"3031","I like it, but its not a full up Alexa like I was told.  At random times it will be non responsive, and at those times I don't know if the device if locked up ot the remote batteries are dead."
"3032","Really enjoying my firestick overall, Interface could sometimes be a little easier and user friendly to navigate, but this has certainly become my go-to streaming device - full of great content and easy to download apps, and the Alexa voice control is way cool. Well done, Amazon!"
"3033","I love fire sticks! I put them in rooms where I don't want to pay for my dish recievers. I got rid of my 2 wired receivers and got 1 wireless and will be saving over $200 a year."
"3034","I was given the Fire TV Stick as a surprise gift from my wife.  I was pleasantly surprised at how fun and useful this thing really is!  I love watching movies, and with the HBO Go app, Netfix, HULU, Crackle, and a ton of other apps, the only thing I struggle with is I can't decide which movie I want to watch!  Great product!  The voice feature is awesome too... ""Find Deadpool"" and viola - there's the movie!"
"3035","Upgraded to a Fire Stick from an Apple Tv. No question this is the much much better buy. It can do ten times more than the Apple Tv and the remote has Alexa in it so now my 5 year old can just say what he wants instead of coming to me every 10 minutes to type something in a search for him. We bought a second one because everyone fights over it in the house now lol."
"3036","So glad I bought the Fire TV Stick!  I'd relied on Netflix for movies but kept seeing many I wanted to watch only on Amazon Prime.  The remote is super easy to use, even the voice command feature.  Prime also supports lots of applications that Netflix does not."
"3037","I haven't used it yet, but I have seen several that my friends have, and they are very happy so as soon as can get one of them to load it I will have to be happy too."
"3038","Works great. Super easy to install & use. I really like it!  Makes my TV a Smart TV. Great to find movies, watch Netflix, etc.Nice to have the option for voice."
"3039","I got the Fire TV Stick with Alexa as a gift.  It's so much fun to use voice and I love that I can watch Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon shows/movies on it.  No complaints."
"3040","We love it! have one on every tv.  my only issue is that the remote requires two hand to open my left hand doesn't work so I cant open it by myself they could have been a little more thoughtful on that otherwise  its great"
"3041","It's great! Not only can you stream Amazon shows it also comes with pre installed apps like Netflix and Pandora.  You can also download additional apps like Showtime Anytime, HBO Go, and apps from other networks like ABC, NBS, ESPN, Bravo, HGTV etc. and you are a cable subscriber you can just log in with your cable information and are able to watch their shows, so essentially the Fire TV Stick can replace a cable box, and you can install only the channels that you watch.  Speed is fast and video quality is excellent."
"3042","The device is wonderful until Lexi says ' I don't know how to respond to that'. Not major but iritatating to an older tech challenged person that wants to watch something, opposed to spending an hour randomly searching to find the help area to learn what the speech recognition can and/or cannot comprehend.The more I learn how to navigate and use the tool correctly the better I like it but sometimes it's a love/hate relationship now. This all could be eliminated just by providing more comprehensive instructions."
"3043","Love the Fire TV Stick with Alexa. It's not flawless though. That's evidenced by my latest Firestick. It's a replacement for one that went belly up rather quickly. When it is working though it's fantastic. Easy setup, controls, etc. No buffering problems with it so I'm assuming it has some type of hardware acceleration. At only $39.95 this device is a steal. (even though my first broke, support quickly walked me through a few tests and then sent me a new device.The customer support alone is worth the device's price.)"
"3044","My son loves this!  Greatly extends the usability of his older TV.  I'm super impressed with how easy the Fire Stick is to set up, and consider it has ""full"" Alexa it's a really great deal."
"3045","Just received, first I don't like the new packaging at all, cheap. I still don't like the remote battery change. You can't get a grip anywhere to slide cover off to install or change batteries. I don't like the fact that the display adjustment was changed, now you have to leave the fire stick and do it through your TV and TV remote. Much easier adjustment before with old stick, as it was done on the fire stick.. new stick is larger but I don't know, it's acting slow and strange. I hope this works its self out. I will update"
"3046","I rated this as a 4 star because the new batteries were dead along with the picture inside where the batteries go was showing the wrong direction. I swapped the batteries out with new ones and put them in the direction that was in the booklet and it finally worked. Overall, we love the fire stick. I honestly would have been happy with the previous version as I could careless about voice search. Instead Amazon should have  used the technology to make the selector circle to be the same as apple's scrolling on their old nano."
"3047","Love these devices. My TVs has HDMI but are not smart, so this lets me get NetFlix and Amazon much more easily than before. Once we get used to this, we are going to drop the cable provided. There is enough good programming between the 2 services that we do not need the other stuff. That will save about $100 a month. No brainer here."
"3048","This is my second Fire Stick. I tried another type of product like this and it just didn't work as easily. Like the ease of use of the Fire Stick and the portability."
"3049","Love the concept. Glitches tho. Don't think it's my internet as I can easily watch movies on my phone when the tv goes into ""working"" or ""searching"" mode"
"3050","it works but still pricy"
"3051","A great way to bring stream tv anywhere you go ( with wifi, of course). I am a KODI lover and was pleased when my techie friend added the KODI app to my latest stick."
"3052","I love it when it works, but it needs to be reset 2-3 times a day....which is a real pain.  I have an older one which only needs to be reset every 2-3 days....I don't know why this one is worse, but I've tried everything.  It's just not as good."
"3053","Perfect in every way, shape, and form. It is such a fun thing to own, and it works so well. Alexa finds any movie or song instantly that you tell it. I would buy again."
"3054","Freezes between selections for a long time, then starts again.Alexa Voice Remote just doesn't want to work most of the time.It has worked maybe 10% of the time (freezes between attempts.)Have internet speed average of 49 Mbps."
"3055","I love my fire stick. It's great for entertainment especially for the kids. Alexa is fun to use and convenient. Just got to be careful with it because it's delicate. The warranty is only for 3 months after that you are out of luck unless you add an extended warranty. This is my second firestick. My first one some how just stopped working. I had it only for 4 months. Hopefully tI won't have the same problem again or else I will be getting the box."
"3056","Wasn't sure about streaming, but. It has proven to be great.  I live in a rural area, I only have 6Mbs download speed, but I've only had one incident where I had a delay.  The Firestick is money well spent ."
"3057","I own a Roku and bought this because of the voice remote and low cost. I love it. I talk into the remote and just say what I want and Alexa does the rest. I can ask for YouTube, Netflix, TV Shows, Movies, etc. When I ask for a weather report Alexa answers verbally and puts the information right on the TV screen. Alexa gives both verbal and visual answers no matter what you ask.I have an Amazon Echo in the same room. There is no interference between the Echo and the Fire TV Stick. Alexa knows which device your using."
"3058","Wonderful firetv stick with Alexa voice remote love the quality of the pictures and tv shows.  Invest into the firetv stick it's great and wonderful to have.  Love it"
"3059","Simply Awesome! I have a Smart TV in the family room but had a Sony (2yrs old) Bravia television that had WiFi capabilities, but I could not get to my NetFlix, and a few gaming Apps. This is amazing! The voice feature is wondrous! I am still working on the Contour App."
"3060","Going to purchase a few more and cut the cord on cable! Even purchasing a few monthly subscriptions for sling and Netflix in addition to prime its way less then cable! Bought one to test it out amd make sure my family was going to be satisfied with their viewing options.....everything we need is available! Occasionally the firestick takes a little bit to wake up after being unused. But I've got nothing bad to say!"
"3061","The Fire Stick seems to work pretty well.  I've noticed on occasion that the Stick will restart randomly (typically when navigating menus).  I was using the dedicated USB power adapter, but it was connected through an HDMI splitter.  When I moved the stick to a dedicated HDMI slot, the issue has not re-occurred.Fire Stick has a good selection of apps comparable with other similar devices and smart TVs."
"3062","we haven't really started using them all the time yet but when we tried them out it was amazing.  I hope we can get used to watching tv by selection rather than cable programming.  We'll see."
"3063","The Amazon fire stick is great. I'm probably going to cancel my cable. I can watch movies and TV shows,  it's way better than I thought it would be.  The only problem I've had is the remote works when it feels like.  You have to keep pressing the home button until the fire stick finds. Which takes a lot longer than the recommended 10 seconds. And the Alexa feature, doesn't seem to understand what your saying.  But other than that,  it's a great piece of technology. I will recommend and I will purchase a couple more."
"3064","Bought the fire stick a couple of weeks ago and i love it. very easy to use and set up. Have been wanting to cut the cord from cable company for some time now and my fee for cable Tv went up again last month! went looking for other options, I have so much more Tv now for free ! No need to try to jailbreak it because you have so much to watch with Amazon prime that there is always something on... ordered my own router and modem and now all I need cable company for is internet ! Went from $220 a month to $75 ! WOW !!!"
"3065","Signed up for Prime in June, mainly for the 2 day shipping. I have been enjoying Prime Music but did not have the ability to watch Prime Video. One of my favorite book series, Bosch, is on Amazon. I binge watched it on our iPad, infuriated that I couldnt enjoy it on our TV...until now! Received my firestick last week and have watched it several times....perfection. Seamless, no problems, no buffering, only question I have it why did I wait to long. Having Alexa on the remote is easy and extremely fast and intuitive."
"3066","So far, so good. It was a change from my Roku and am able to download programs to it. It does the job for the money and I'm not lining the pockets of the cable companies."
"3067","Been using this for over 6 months.  This with the combination of Amazon Prime and Netflix allowed me to cancel a cable box for a room.  Save's me $5 a month for additional cable box"
"3068","This item has exceeded my expectations. I am so happy with my Fire TV sick, I am going to buy one for everyone I love, to give as gifts  It only took me about a week to get used to not having cable TV. The fire TV stick offers so much more than I was ever getting from cable TV."
"3069","I really like it and the picture looks even better with the fire stick and I like the voice respond I going to buy another one for the living room. Its really great."
"3070","I love this thing. The voice works pretty good. It would be nice if I could turn my TV off and if it would integrate with TiVo. But all in all I give it 2 thumbs up."
"3071","So glad I bought this. Given that I have Amazon prime, it's crazy to  not utilize this service. Installation was so easy that it was like, ""Wait"" is that it?"
"3072","So far I am loving that I can finally watch Downton Abbey but I have to figure out what is free on here because a lot of shows I was hoping to see are pay, pay, pay!"
"3073","only had for a short time...not a bad deal for 'prime' members...decent movie selection.... remote is attractive with minimal buttons, but so smooth it is hard to battery cover off(but when will you nned to do that)"
"3074","This actually turned all my tv's into t smart tv's. There is so much to choose from. I love the Easy to use remote. I love Alexa. We are so happier than we imagined!"
"3075","I am receiving a message at setup saying USB cable is insufficient  us the cable come with the package. The point is I did so the cable that came with both of the fire sticks is not sufficient to properly work with the fire sticks."
"3076","I started using this up on one of our televisions after using Roku for a while. This is very easy to set up and use. The tv is not a """"smart"" tv and this essentially turns it into one."
"3077","Love the firestick better than the roku . The Alexia is useless to me just like Siri . But I don't care about the alexia . Don't see a need to buy the higher priced ones because this works great ."
"3078","So far so good.  It was very easy to install on my smart TV.  I'm still learning the remote functions and have used the Alexa feature a few times to find the show I was looking for.  It didn't always find it but that could be my ineptness in asking for it properly.  It's a lot more fun to stream and watch shows off my Tv than my IPad."
"3079","I installed the stick with great expectations only to be dissapointed.I like the TV,movie genre but my main interest was music, I watch 4 hrs of tv and listen to music about 12 hrs a day. If you don’t have frequent interaction with the remote it shuts down until you do. This is not what I paid for it is not what I subscribed to."
"3080","The voice remote is pretty useless but I still like the Fire TV stick.  Although I have the box, the stick is useful for traveling, which I do a lot of.  I also leave the box on my main TV and just use the stick if I'm watching in another room."
"3081","This is a wonderful little gadget!!!  All of my channels in one place, and I LOVE being able to say, ""Alexa, go to...""  Sure beats having to scan through hundreds of shows in my playlist!!!!!"
"3082","MY DAD GAVE ME THE FIRESTICK FOR A GIFT, PROBABLY BECAUSE I COMPLAINED  ABOUT ALL THE PROVIDERS IVE TRIED AND NONE OF THEM DELIVERED.. I ABSOLUTELY WISH I HAD THIS  LITTLE FIRESTICK ALL ALONG. I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. YOU WONT BE SORRY IF YOU ARE SICK AND TIRED OF ALL THE BS THE  CABLE COMPANIES  PROMISE AND THEN DON'T  DELIVER BUY IT NOW!"
"3083","Pretty easy to use. Can not choose between profiles in hulu and that's something we hope is corrected SOONMore to try and much more to learn about but at this point we like it."
"3084","After learning how to install this (with the help of someone from the Geek Squad), and after help from the Technical Dept. at Verizon, I am now able to enjoy the Fire Stick.  I love it, and it was well worth the hassle (for a non-techie.)  However, I did not realize how much data streaming a movie costs (again non-techie), and I hope others will find this out before committing to the Fire Stick."
"3085","This thing makes finding and watching almost anything as simple as talking to myself. It takes all the fuss out of finding the program I want. It can be moved from TV to TV which is another great feature for us.Any TV show or movie I want begins to play in 20 seconds or less. Was an excellent purchase, and will become my Christmas present to everyone."
"3086","Overall, 4.5 out of 5 stars.  Super convenient add-on to any TV with an HDMI around the house.  Easy set up.  It's a minor gripe, but I wish it was a little faster and would want the power cord to be a little longer.  The dongle extension is nice, but again, for those of us not super handy to be able to hide wires behind walls, a longer cord would have been nice."
"3087","Loved my firestick remote, until it stopped working. Completely unresponsive. My roomates completely stopped working as well. Amazon will not replace. I have already paid $100 for my year of amazon prime, i pay $35 a month for my hbo, showtime, and netflix that i cannot watch except on my ipad. I refuse to put one more penny into amazons pocket for their remote. My advice? Dont do it. Go another direction. It only worked for a couple of months too by the way. Its a problem for alot of people."
"3088","I am so happy with this purchase! This product packs a powerful punch in such a small package! Set up was so incredibly easy, and it slips easily into the HD MI  port in my TV. I love that I can easily warch all my favorite shows on Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime. I love the apps and extra channels I can watch. I enjoy how easy it was to transfer my photos to my television and see them on the big  screen. The games and  music apps are fun and easy to use. The remote is awesome; I love the voice recognition feature! efinitely recommend!"
"3089","It works just fine.  I've used the voice remote only twice.  The first time it didn't work, but the second time I spoke much more distinctly and it worked just fine."
"3090","We are really happy with the Fire Stick! The first one we received was acting very erratic, but Amazon replaced it for us and this newest one is 100% reliable and easy to use!"
"3091","My answer to cutting the cord with cable.  Was very easy to install for this tech-not-so-savy person.  Only problem was the shipping delay but other than that, it works great."
"3092","awesome little device that lets you add on pretty much anything if you know what you're doing I've cancelled my subscriptions to Netflix Hulu and cable love this little Gadget"
"3093","Bought this as a gift for my daughter since I got one for my husband for Christmas. She loves it and is able to stream movies for the baby without any interruptions."
"3094","This would be 5 stars but before receiving this I had tried 3 firesticks and 4 remotes, none of which would respond to the remote although they were useable if I used the app on my smartphone as a remote. Customer service were helpful but could not get remotes to respond despite many tries with all 4 remotes. Just installed this one and it works perfectly. I have another firestick I bought and installed (on another TV) about 3 months ago and have had no problems with it."
"3095","Remote stopped working in day two. Amazon sent me a new one in 2 days. Fire stick is ok, but it is at times slow and it freezes a lot.  Wish it could handle the data faster."
"3096","Seriously in love with this little device - the install could NOT have been any easier - very simple plug and play!  It had loaded with my Prime information so the amount of TV shows, movies, music is overwhelming - and the Amazon Studios show Goliath was incredible - perfect role for Billy Bob Thornton. I have watched a couple of movies, caught up on TV series and streamed music - all with ease - the voice command is simply amazing - clear and concise.  Wish my voice recognition on my cell was nearly as accurate.  Thank you Amazon!"
"3097","Great device for delivering TV we watch.  Using at lakehouse where cable / dish rates are high, and internet band rates are much more affordable.  Meets our needs at a great price."
"3098","I love the convenience of having all my favorites channels and the ease of watching all my favorite shows. I even found some new shows that are soon to be new favorites."
"3099","I'm totally satisfied with my Fire TV Stick watching great movies and shows.  Hope to take it with me everywhere I go where HDMI TV.I consider it a great purchase."
"3100","I purchased 3 Fire TV sticks before I got one that actually worked. The first stick I ordered through the Amazon app. After 5 days it crashed. Amazon sent me a new one and it didn't work. All I did was plug the second stick and it wouldn't even load the Amazon logo. All it showed was the rainbow broadcast grid. I then waited a few months and walked into my local Best Buy and purchased my Fire TV stick there. I have had it for 2 weeks without problems"
"3101","Love it! I would never pay for cable or satellite, but this is worth the investment. I can stream from Netflix, Prime, Hulu, etc. And, I can purchase or rent at the push of a button. Only wish I could control at least some volume with this control, that is why I gave it a 4.I love that I never have to connect my phone or computer now to stream. The fire stick is practically invisible on my tv, which is very aesthetically pleasing to me :)"
"3102","Got two of these and one works great and the other works good, but had a very hard time connecting to wifi.  But after many failed attempts got it going and now works good."
"3103","Works great.  I was impressed at how well the voice recognition works.  Plays a lot of music that I was surprised was in the Prime library.  We also use this to get Sling TV which seems very good.  Easy to set up.  My only (really minor) complaint is with the remote - I'm used to holding a remote in my palm and pushing the buttons with thumb or index finger.  I found this remote is difficult to use that way and works better holding it in your hand with palm over the control and pushing the buttons with your index finger."
"3104","I've always been an avid Apple TV user since all I have is Apple products. I started hearing about he jail broken fire stick and once it went on sale for Black Friday I took the plunge. I'm a prime user so if you dont have the membership it prob wouldn't be as good. Tons of free movies shows and I really enjoy the music options. Then once jailbroken the sky's the limit. It's amazing. So good I called Directv and removed all movie channels off of my bill. I don't see myself goin back to Apple TV anytime soon. Thanks guys"
"3105","Works OK, but lacks processing power to stream 1080P at 60fps.  This makes sports on PSVue app nearly unwatchable.  Also has issues streaming across my Plex server.  Picture quality was fine, but the audio drops out every 5-10 seconds.  My four year old Roku 2 box doesn't have these issues.The location of the usb connection on the power adapter can be problematic if you're trying to plug it in behind a wall mounted TV.  I could not get it plugged in behind my Samsung 50"" LED mounted on a Monoprice mount."
"3106","I thought this was going to be nice product to go along with our Amazon Dot. However, there is no connection between the two and I'm finding the Fire Stick's voice controls don't seem very sophisticated. But the real deal breaker is that this doesn't have a Vudu app. I've got 50 or more movies on Vudu and the Fire Stick's inability to access Vudu seriously limits its functionality for us. I guess I'll be sending it back and paying an extra $10 for the Roku which does all the Fire Stick does but also includes Vudu."
"3107","it is not hands free, it only works with internet provided shows (does not work with standard broadcasting), it forces the TV to either be on one port or another, cannot easily switch from Fire to standard TV....had trouble finding Netflix shows, was not plug and play, took 1 hour to find out what it does not do.... so I am unimpressed... and every time I have contact with Amazon devices, they are always trying to put their hand in my wallet....we have the republicans for that so I don't need Amazon to add to it.."
"3108","I'm super happy with it! I'm still getting  a feel for the things beyond the basics. It has a lot of additional things that can be done with it. On the basic end, it's not hard to use, but going further in exploring, it's software is rather vast and complex. I lost the remote a few days after its arrival and unfortunately, I still haven't found it. Luckily, there is a good remote control app to use in its place."
"3109","Kind of a clunky device since t needs to be plugged in for power and HDMI. The interface is confusing because I have a smart TV that also has Amazon built in and sometimes it's hard to know which Amazon device I'm using and to use the correct remote. My main reason was to use this device to mirror from my tablet and phone. The connection is not smooth and the picture quality drops significantly when mirroring from android tablet or iPhone. Overall, the fire stick does not meet my needs to cast videos easily and clearly."
"3110","This has been the best purchase in a long time.  I always used to have Chromecasts on every TV but with the Prime Stick I can use 5GHz and the quality is amazing!  Chromecast for me would freeze sometimes and the quality was never as good as the Prime Stick.  Plus, being able to use Plex as a streaming service has really been nice.  I used to try using it for Chromecast but never work well.  If you have Prime then you must purchase this stick.  I wish I had ordered it when it first came out."
"3111","Amazing device for such an affordable price. Able to use all the apps that I love and no longer need my tablet because this provides all the entertainment I need in HD! So glad I got this.. you can even look at all your prime photos which is another great touch. Hd connector is a must and helps with connection. I have a pretty high internet package so live sports aren't laggy. I'd be interested to see how it would be with a less potent internet package. Nonetheless, easy to use and very fast"
"3112","I have a. Pimple fire sticks do when I need another streaming device I decided to stick with the fire stick. The new one includes Alexa voice activated help. Works well and is quicker than previous models."
"3113","There is so much more to watch now - with no commercials. I have movies, TV series, Amazon series, and I've only just begun to explore the all the choices. Worth every penny and it wasn't expensive!"
"3114","SO inexpensive but so powerful.  I recommend these to my friends and family and I know over 25 people with these.  Great product as stock or with jailbroken software.Thanks Amazon!"
"3115","This is easy to use but getting the back off to put the batteries in was very very difficult.  It works great on my older TV, however you still need to purchase channels"
"3116","Just bought the Firestick and I love it. An added benefit is that it finds and plays my google play music - automatically! There is an Amazon music app on my ROKU box but it does not work no matter what I do. I have seen complaints that the Firestick favors Amazon Prime material. Maybe, but it is so easy to get to any app that I don't see the problem. Alexa works great, the unit is is fast, and it is cheap. I have several ROKU boxes but I like the Firestick better than all of them and it is now my go to steaming device."
"3117","Buying this allowed me to cut the cord on cable. Overall very good purchase. Couple of things I wish it had.1. Does not integrate with Logitech universal remotes. Means I have to have a second remote handy.2. I have amazon echo dot. Would be great if I could just tell alexa to interact with fire stick rather than use the remote.3.  Don't like the power cord. I know there is a USB alternative you can purchase but you should have to."
"3118","I love my firestick I have put them on each tv and got rid of cable all together. What a huge savings every month! If you could just make the remote a tiny bit bigger so it did not get lost every day that would be greatly appreciated! I hope this is helpful!"
"3119","Great product, easy to set up and makes using apps like prime video and Netflix a breeze on my tv. A lot less steps than using a bluray or other devices like an Xbox to access. The video also loads a lot faster and the interactive menu is smooth and easy to browse. Only complaint is the remote randomly stops working and the batteries need to be removed and replaced to work again. Seems to be a known problem as others have posted about it before. This still didn't deter me from ordering a 2nd one for our other tv."
"3120","This is is very good. Very easy to hook up & operate. I LOVE sling TV! Gotten rid of Directv, because I can get a decent coverage of live sports. The only negative is not broadcast with audio HD, so if you have 5.1 stereo receiver like myself, or higher, you only get 2 speaker stereo.The video is 1080p HD. Plus, you get Alexa, and she answers right on your tv screen. I'm very happy I chose to do this, & save a lot of $ compared to satellite. Just make sure you have high enough internet speed to support streaming."
"3121","Waited for this thing to be in stock for about a month, must be in high demand.Easy to install, and the Downloader free feature will let you watch things like KODI etc.This paired with KODI, I can ditch Netflix and Hulu like a bad habit. Well worth it!"
"3122","The firestick is awesome. Cable is a thing of the past and if you haven't gotten a firestick yet then you're totally missing out. One word ""kodi"" should be enough of a reason to buy one. I bought one and then a week later bought two more. Next I'm getting the fire TV."
"3123","I have had this for about a year and love it. It works way faster than my Smart TV functions and the interface is so much nicer and easy to navigate. Depending on the TV it may be hard to work around a wall mount, but otherwise no issues."
"3124","This was given to me as a gift.  It's a really great product and easy to set up and use.  If I can do it, anyone can. There's a lot of good selections for tv viewing."
"3125","Headline says it. Otherwise works good, interface is fair, I probably just have to get used to it. It is in the guest room, so I guess they have to get used to it."
"3126","I have prime and expected to receive this quickly but I literally got this the next day! I was shocked to receive Saturday after ordering it on Friday. Great gift!"
"3127","My kids really liked it. However both remotes broke in less than a year! A new remote is more expensive than the a new fire stick and remote! After reading multiple reviews this seems to be a problem for most of the people who bought this!!! Sent Amazon a inquiry about replacing it  but never got a response.  Ridiculous that remote is more expensive than the unit! Useless without the remotes!!"
"3128","I just got it and within three minutes was watching prime and netflix on it.  Another ten later I had a great TV app installed.  This thing is a god send for people living on a budget."
"3129","Great product. I decided to get rid of my cable. But before I jumped ship, I wanted to test out. I am very satisfied with the product and the endless possibilities for customization."
"3130","Great device. If you're tech-savvy you can get access to 70,000+ TV shows and movies, also live TV channels including on-demand and PPV. Cable bill was ~$200, now I pay $40 for internet + $10 for modem rental each month and have access to more media than before.  Best technological investment I've made in years. Definitely recommend."
"3131","This Fire Stick is the best thing smoking right now. My cousin has the older Fire Stick which made me wanna purchase one well actually four! This updated version is new & improve & have a voice activation on the remote. I couldn't​ be more please with this product!!"
"3132","If you love television and you do not want to pay for Redbox, Blockbuster or even go to the movies, this is the way to go.  The expense of At&t or direct tv seems to be raising higher then my annual pay raise. Who can afford that. The is an alternative to that bill."
"3133","It's ok my friends talked about it and how much ch they love it so I got a fire stick n I'm not sure what the big deal is or I'm just not getting everything it does"
"3134","Love it, it was easy to hook up and it works better than I thought it would.  I cut my "" cable service "" this great more tv available than I have time to watch."
"3135","Incredible little piece of heaven that can do almost anything. Seriously...order a pizza, Google something, turn on Netflix, play Kodi, play Hulu...it does everything. Packaging was easy to figure out, I suggest looking up the micro USB power supply that can plug into your TV. The long power adapter can be rather cumbersome when trying to move the Stick from room to room. I ordered a 2 pack of the micro USB adapters to eliminate the problem. But overall, very happy with this purchase. Might buy another one soon."
"3136","I love this stick. The voice control requires you to hold while you speak, not like the Alexa echo who is always listening. Still flawless performance and easy to use."
"3137","This thing works great. I wish I had purchased it before I did. Works great with Play Station Vue!!!"
"3138","We just started with Fire TV but love it.  It immediately knew who was installing and was extremely easy to set up.  When I took it to another TV, it was like it was already set up and just ran without any problems.  It is easy to use and the remote is light and responds well to voice commands.  Really love this new way of watching streaming videos from my TV instead of my PC.  One other benefit that really surprised us was that when we took the TV off of cable and switched to Fire TV, the picture was so much better."
"3139","Great for streaming, optimized for chewing data, be careful if you have limited bandwidth!I have 2 fire tvs and 2 fire sticks.... I am peaking at 50-60gb/day. yes gigabytes per day. if you call anybody, they act like that's normal.all my settings are so that i prevent non-intended data usage, screen saver off, autoplay off, resolution set to 720p...I have read about it on the forums and it seems like i am not alone.Otherwise it is a great device, great quality, makes my tv smart, im happyGood luck"
"3140","Works about as well as you might expect, but there are times when it will lag or freeze without warning.  They say it is my ISP service, but everything else in the house is still connected (and we have a lot of wifi devices).  Amazon Prime (specifically) works well with a lot of content for those that are serious about cutting the cord to cable / satellite programming. Combines well with other services like Netflix or HBOGo, etc"
"3141","Pretty Good so far I have dierct tv now so far I had to restart  the app because it freeze up but the free movies apps work great no freeze up hope it last for a long time I only had it for a week we will see"
"3142","Took it on our road trip. Was able to use it in all of the hotels. Unfortunately we were weren't able to use many of the features while we were in Canada. We were pretty much only allowed to use Netflix. But other than that small issue... I LOVE it!"
"3143","This remote is very simple to use! It is a small sleek design (gets lost in the couch sometimes!) but we love how easy it is to use! The stixk plugs right into the TV and we have no issues with using it within 5-10min of plugging in and then we were watching our programming!"
"3144","I have tried really hard to love my stick!!  I love the features and the apps, unfortunately my content is always buffering. I've done everything to resolve the issue: restarting, moving router right next to device, un plugging stick and router and restarting....but STILL have the buffering drama.  I have a gaming package with my cable company and 3 Roku devices that have no issues!  Going back to Roku! 😕😕😕"
"3145","Love the price! You do get Showtime with it for one free month trial and CBS. I used the Showtime trial and you will have to put your info in but I set a reminder to unsubscribe before the month ends. You also get a $7 credit for a movie rental/purchase so that’s cool. I don’t have a smart tv so this was totally worth the purchase and I can watch Netflix/Hulu without hearing the PlayStation make a noisy sound."
"3146","We're Prime subscribers and enjoy watching the shows and movies available  at no extra cost via the Fire TV Stick. Easy to install, use and enjoy.  Definitely recommend it."
"3147","well I dropped my satelite provider and I bought 4 of these for the tvs in my house.  They are awesome.  I also like the parental controls so my kids cant watch certain programs or buy games and such."
"3148","Loving it so far, all of our movies and shows in one place, including our personal collection using the KODI app! Super convenient and really easy to set up and use. Absolutely recommend this product!"
"3149","Having problems connecting this product to Kodi app. Have  tried everything. My grandsons who are very tech savvy and connected Kodi to their Firestick are baffled.  Connects fine to Amazon Prime app."
"3150","It could not be easier to use. We have had one T our summer cabin for over a year and realized it was rime to get it for home.  The remote is so much better than a cable remote which can be slow.  It is making life as a cors cutter so sweet. I have not figured out how to connect with alexa!  Coice activation is the next indulgence."
"3151","I am so thrilled I finally got on board and purchased a Fire TV Stick. It has definitely revolutionized my viewing experience when I am at home. All of the different add-ons you can have and I love it the most because it's so mobile. I can just unplug it and be on my way if need be. Thankfully I haven't lost my remote yet but as the saying goes..There's an app for that so I do have the app on my phone as well. Getting a Fire TV stick is definitely the more affordable way to take your Smart TV to the next level!"
"3152","It works fine. I can watch Netflix, or Prime. There seems to be lots of options for other streaming apps too. But it has drawbacks. For example, it can't filter between free and paid programs. In fact the only way you can tell is if you click on the thumbnail of the program. So you can't even scroll past it. And if you search for a specific program through the app, you only get Amazon video results. What about all the shows on Netflix? I feel that those shows should be represented in the search results as well."
"3153","This is an amazing device. I have 2 of them and will be giving them as X-mas gifts! Very user friendly, great TV shows and Movies at your finger tips!Highly recommended."
"3154","After buying four cables to hook up a laptop to the TV to watch Netflix with NO success, I tried this.Most impressed ! easy set up...worked perfect first time, excellent product.I highly recommend it."
"3155","This definitely changed my TV viewing.  I love movies, so this is the best Bang for your Buck!  Watch out Cable TV, more people will be ""cutting the cord"""
"3156","It's really good streaming g device. But I returned c it to get that amazon tv box. I will be purchasing the fire tv box when it goes on sale during bf deals. If they don't then I'll buy it at regular price then."
"3157","Love it. As someone who has an Apple TV device, a google chrome device, and a roku smart tv (these were all gifts - I'm not a crazy techie), I have to say, the fire stick is leaps and bounds more convenient - so far no issues (I had an issue with the setup and activation of ALL the other devices, especially the roku tv - no problems AT ALL with the fire setup). Larger selection than other devices. More streamlined and organized than other devices."
"3158","So many great apps to download and content to view/listen - I think the video quality is even better than our Chromecast when watching YouTube videos and netflix!"
"3159","Still learning my way around it. I'm debating dropping cable and using apps through Prime and the Fire Stick. Looks like I can get most shows just a day later. Football is important so I've got to check that out. Already ordered an antennae for air TV to get my local news and shows. I'll be back to update."
"3160","My first firestick stopped working suddenly and for no reason after about a year of everyday use. I ordered this new one and it works just fine. Plug it in and go!"
"3161","Alexa isn't quite as advanced as she's made to seem - simple commands like ""go back 3 minutes"", she can't do (although she can fast forward, as advertised).  Searching for TV shows is easy, but if they're available through a free app like NBC that option won't show up in ""ways to watch"".  It will show you how to purchase or watch for no additional charge through Netflix, hulu, and amazon.  Overall it's still a great alternative to traditional cable, plus you can listen to music and stream youtube videos and such."
"3162","I've cancelled my cable because I don't need it anymore, thanks to everything I can access with my prime account and the Netflix and Hulu apps on the fire stick. My one gripe is that I can't access Youtube through the stick, which would be so much easier than having to watch a youtube video through my small computer screen or even tinier phone screen. The Alexa feature makes the stick even more convenient, especially since i'm regularly searching different movies and TV shows through the various apps. Love this!"
"3163","While it is easy to use , the drawback I find that I have to reboot it at times since that little swirly circle comes on & it cannot access the HOME screen.  The Internet connection is strong yet, I knocks the program out and have to reboot."
"3164","Easy initial setup with the on-line prompts.  Several included apps with more in the app store.  Loads of third party apps and videos on Youtube.Excellent stable streaming.  Something for everyone.  Hard to go wrong."
"3165","I love it. I travel a lot and it is very portable and takes up little room in the suitcase. I can watch Netflix, Amazon prime, and HBO go. Now if I could watch my Xfinity dvr, it would be even better."
"3166","The remote quit working and replacing the batteries did not resolve the issue.  The iPhone app works intermittently.  When I can interact with the Fire TV Stick, I like it but the issues with the provided controller and iPhone app have made it a frustrating device."
"3167","It is sort of what i expected. My TVs are all Smart TVs so i get the same stuff as far as Apps go. I could not give the Fire Stick 5 stars because it was a pain to open. I almost crushed it in my hands while trying to insert the batteries. The design is ridiculous."
"3168","Great Streaming device but.....I wish it would, once hooked to my account, load a mirror of my other streaming stick and that I did not have to load those already selected programs/sites and the need to reenter passwords.  Just sayin'"
"3169","Not my first fire stick and won't be my last.  The added Alexa integration is good.  Kid's like it because it's easy to request Eye of the Tiger song from the Rocky movies lol."
"3170","Works exactly as expected! Turns any tv into a smart tv by connecting to your home wifi! Love this inexpensive solution to watching my Netflix, Hulu, and amazon shows!"
"3171","all I can say is AWESOME!!!!"
"3172","I like it. The variety of the shows on fire stick are greater than the regular amazon feature on my smart TV.However, the Fire stick interferes with my TV antenna reception. I have to unplug the fire stick and keep it at least a foot away from my television so that the TV antenna will have adequate signal. Plugging and unplugging is a nuisance when you have to toggle between regular TV and FireTV."
"3173","We installed a new TV in our bedroom and we did not want to pay for another cable box or the install to run new wires into our room, so my husband ordered this. It came like the day it was available (it was on backorder when the order was placed). It is awesome!!! I am so happy with it, the internet connection in our room is awful, but there has been ZERO issues with connecting to our internet and streaming movies and videos. I am just that much closer now to cutting the cord! Great product and I will be buying another one soon!"
"3174","I don't know why I didn't get this sooner. Easiest streaming device ever, love it. I haven't had a chance to view the full extent, but I'm really happy to have it. Even got aa friend to buy one within 10 minutes of setup. Great shopping experience."
"3175","Since we don't have cable, we're now watching movies & have several other options.  Our grand kids were happy to see the games section scroll by.  It was easy to install (our son did it so it was really easy for us), it's user-friendly, the picture is great.  I wasn't sure, since we don't have cable or a smart TV, how well it would work. We did buy a new flat-screen TV in January & it's compatible w/the fire TV stick.  We're very pleased with it."
"3176","Really cool, and easy to hook up and use. We've already watched several movies, and have checked into some of the trial offers. We're very happy with the Fire Stick."
"3177","So far, we are enjoying it.  The interface is a little clunky to navigate, but it isn't to the point that it is a problem."
"3178","If I could review the stick and remote separately, the stick would gtake a 5 and remote a 1... the streaming is seamless and the available apps are great. The remote stops working, I have to repeat the batteries for it to work again... if not for this problem, I would have rated a 5."
"3179","The only issue we've had to this point is losing connection with our WiFi, and buffering, from time to time. It is possible that the location of our wireless router relative to the stick may be at the edges of the coverage range, so that could explain it. So basically make sure that the stick is close enough to the WiFi signal to deal with that.Didn't realize that the stick needs a power source either when we bought it. Luckily for us the power strip had openings, otherwise there could be an issue."
"3180","Got this for my wife to connect to Netflix, BeachBody on Demand, and Plex server.  She is thrilled!  It's cool to be able to talk into your remote (future of TV!).  Setup was easy, packaging was elegant, the remote is responsive and the wifi connection speeds are excellent for being at the opposite side of the house from the router.  A++"
"3181","I love it. I was having trouble streaming with my smart Bluray player so decided to try the Fire Stick. I was amazed, it was much more than I expected. It’s also much faster than expected"
"3182","Completely satisfied"
"3183","I recently purchased 2 of these! I absolutely love them! the Amazon Fire TV Sticks give you access to hundreds of hours of programming and TV shows to watch at your leisure. There are many different apps and channels, including several Zen, Relaxation, and Workout Channels. You can also watch some live TV and Sports programming. There are also games for my children to play, access to Amazon Music and everything Prime! I couldn't be happier with the Fire Stick! Thank you Amazon! No more outrageous cable bill for me!"
"3184","Best investment we could have made to work with Hulu Live TV. Our bluray player would give us such trouble streaming and we wanted to use Hulu Live TV, so we decided to try this out. It's affordable and definitely worth the money we spent to save on cable. Sometimes it's a little hard to get the remote to work but it's a matter of figuring out the right spot to point it at. It was so easy to setup and use that my 11 year old did most of the work."
"3185","Had bought a roku and a week later i got the firestck as a Christmas present from work. When I plugged it in, about a week later,I noticed right off the bat that the picture quality was a lot better , the buffering stopped and it has DVR capabilities. I would recommend this to any one trying to decide what one to get."
"3186","It was great while it . I loved it. received it on the 22nd of June and now it's not working and it's only got a 30 day warranty. I would think Amazon could do better than that."
"3187","Great device easy to use and there is A LOT of support on the WEB one can refer to. Only negative is you have to buy an app to send or stream from an Apple device."
"3188","I received the Fire stick as a gift for my birthday . I couldn't be happier. The menu graphics are beautiful and offer great insight to content of movie. Alexa is the icing on the cake. How did we ever get along without her?☺😃"
"3189","I like it.. I still don't understand why if I have Amazon Prime I still have to pay for a ton of tv shows and movies when I access the site. It's a huge rip off in my opinion"
"3190","So far so good! One day it started freezing, but my daughter said it was all over the internet that something was wrong somewhere and Amazo was trying to fix it!"
"3191","works great when it's connected to wi fi. however, I notice it will disconnect when it's been on over 2 hours or so. otherwise, it's great.would recommend."
"3192","Grandpa and I love this to see more shows and movies without a bunch of different memberships.Son advised us to get this and he programed and installed it."
"3193","Just got this two days ago.  I am blown away how much faster this thing is than the old one I bought a year ago, it's like night and day.  No more taking forever to startup and load apps.  You click something and it actually opens.  My old fire stick had at least a 20-30 second delay from clicking to it actually opening, this new one seems immediate. I will buy a second one of these for sure, I wouldn't have really recommended the old fire stick due to the lag and old processor, but this new one is the streaming stick to beat now."
"3194","It's a great little stick! Surprisingly fast. Would be nice to have a native YouTube app on it. But there are ways around it which makes it ok. Would recommend to anyone looking for a streaming device at a lower price point that will potentially take it on the go."
"3195","Works great, and easy to set up. My Roku 2 wouldn't work after we moved and only about 6 months old, and they have no customer service for that product, soooo decided to not go with them again. This fire stick does the trick for streaming Netflix and Amazon prime."
"3196","This is the best Fire TV Stick, ever so easy to use, finds what you want very quickly. The remote is nice and slim fits perfect in your hand. Easy to follow directions."
"3197","My life just keeps getting better. So easy and quick to install and before you know it I'm giving commands and watching Prime Videos. Thank you Amazon and Alexa."
"3198","I don't like how it won't let you on Netflix without the parental control code if you have it set. I feel it should recognize the parental control settings on Netflix and determine if the code is needed at all. I bought this for my 7 year olds birthday and I have the controls set so he can't download random stuff or buy anything. So it really is discouraging to have to input a code every time he wants to watch Netflix. Other than that I think it's good. My son even likes that Alexa sang happy birthday to him!"
"3199","Great product at great price! Bought it on Black Friday deal for just 24 bucks!  Very satisfied! Works with mytv remote! I can use my Sony smart tv remote to control both the tv and the fire stick! This was not advertised in the web page! Very fast and fluid speed... now I only use my tv remote to control everything!"
"3200","As we are yet to own a ""smart TV,"" we have absolutely LOVED this Fire TV Stick. As an Amazon Prime member, I now have access to all of the Amazon programming (which is excellent) and more. We have been TV-binging since we received. Very easy to install, and the Alexa Voice feature makes it very easy to navigate (I think I may have found the search functions a bit frustrating without Alexa, but being able to simply say what I want makes this very easy!)."
"3201","This product is so good that I feel compelled to write this Amazon product review. It was love at first sight. The initial out-of-the-box experience is such a delight. The packaging is clever, compact and ""light."" The product came with the Stick, USB power cable, power plug, Voice Remote, 2 AAA batteries and a HDMI extender cable. All these six items were compactly tugged into different compartments that folded up into a box of 6"" x 3.5"" x 1.25"".There is a slight nuisance with the Alexa Voice Remote. It was not easy to slide the backcover of this remote to place the batteries. To preserve the overall ""smoothness"" of this gadget, the indent area to grab the backcover was too shallow to slide the cover off for its first time use.Once the Stick is plugged into a HDMI port and powered, setting up the Fire TV Stick is intuitive even for a first time user of the Amazon Fire stick. The set up screen come on my TV with a list of found WIFI SSID. Select my home network then enter my network password. It quickly connected to my WIFI network. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Stick knows my Amazon account. (A shrewd Amazon marketing lock-in to easily purchase or rent video or audio.) Enter my Amazon password, I was logged into my Amazon account and set up for me to try out Alexa. The whole set up process feels snappy. It was finished in less than 5 minutes.By pressing the ""Mic"" button on top of the Voice Remote, the TV blinks with a chime, meaning ready to listen. I said: ""James Bond."" Quite a few videos were listed with the most recent ones first. This list include freebies as well as those for rent or purchase. I asked Alexa: ""List Woody Allen.""  The database is quite extensive. Then I asked for ""Asian movies."" The list came back was extensive too. Query like ""Woody Allen Keaton before 1990"" seems to work as well.This morning I tried out Alexa on Prime Music. I said: ""Play Bob Dylan."" It started right away. Then ""play soothing music."" Alexa came back with a Baroque station, to which I have been listening while writing this review. Integrating Alexa to Fire has allowed me to un-tether my laptop to the TV. In the process, I can stay on my couch to switch between video and music accessing the extensive library of Amazon Prime media. Alexa has proved to be intuitive to use. Its vocabulary seems to be extensive and capable of disambiguating accented pronunciation. While on the Alexa Voice Remote, pressing its ""select"" button will turn on the TV. However it cannot turn off the TV unless the TV is connected to a smart home device.When I tether my laptop via HDMI to my large screen TV, the laptop's screen resolution only took up half of the TV screen. With Fire Stick, I am now getting the full screen. To take full advantage of Fire Stick/Prime library, I plan to connect my TV audio to the stereo system to get better sound quality through the TV's optical audio port, which is the last remaining audio output for my TV.The All-new Fire Stick is an amazing product bundled with an intuitive voice interface, which integrated well with a speedy search technology over a rich media library. I can comfortably say that for the movie and music lovers, this new Fire Stick is a joy to have."
"3202","I love it! Works great- it's fast, stable, and I really like the interface. Being my first Fire TV, I love the seamless integration with all of my Amazon services. I replaced my Roku with this and don't regret it. My cable contract is up next month and I'm replacing it with Sony PS VUE and this device works great with that service."
"3203","I am enjoying my new Fire TV stick with Alexa voice remote. Once I remembered to hold down the voice button it worked fine, my error. The instillation was so easy, I would recommend this product to anyone wishing for an easy way to stream content."
"3204","works great and the remote is easy to use,i had a netgear and the remote sucks,if you have prime the movies they are already there without having to open anything"
"3205","Works as I thought it would. BUT: if an app crashes you have to restart the device which takes about 3 to 4 minutes. AND the display does not fit my TV with no way to correct it. ( It s too big, and the display setting to adjust is not active). It gets 4 Stars but the issues can be fixed with an update IF Amazon chooses to do so."
"3206","I have an AppleTV in my great-room, I purchased the FireTV Stick for my son's room/guest-room, not sure I'd like it for my bedroom TV or great-room because I feel the AppleTV is better, but it does the trick in there to get rid of the cable box, I can't cut the cord quite yet though because I'm still not able to pick up local stations with an indoor antenna."
"3207","Very happy with purchase as device is very easy to use.  I've been a Prime member for two years, but never really utilized the Amazon Prime channel because I could only view it on a smart tv and the format was not user friendly.  Loving the Fire TV Stick and the ease of use of moving between apps.  Got rid of cable and picked up HULU, so the Fire TV Stick was necessary for the Live option.  Plan on purchasing two more Fire TV Sticks for additional tvs when stock becomes available again."
"3208","This product is AMAZING.  We never watch ""regular"" TV anymore.  The selection of programming is amazing - and the voice activated search feature is so much easier than trying to type something in.  We decided to sign up for Amazon Prime this year, so the programming is even better. Without a doubt, the best $39.99 I've spent in a very, very long time"
"3209","On Kodi, doesn't play or stream 90 % of the Movies. I even have good internet. Netflix has no problems when I use a different device.. thinking of switching back to Netflix next month. Save Ur money"
"3210","My ""smart"" tv got a lot smarter. Fire stick brings content very quickly and with high resolution to the tv. Very happy I bought it. Thank you again Amazon!"
"3211","This was so easy to install and use. It also has the ability to install the Alexander app. Adds loads of options for movies and music. Definitely worth the cost."
"3212","Really like this product, I only wish that my TV was fire enabled. I can ask Alexa to go to ""Netflix"" and she will turn on my TV, but I can't get her to turn off the TV. Again, I believe because my of my TV."
"3213","The Fire TV Stick is awesome. I had been considering building an entertainment center PC to run streaming apps and store content for a long while now. When rain came pouring through the roof of our condo and we had to live in a hotel for over 100 days while our place was repaired and remodeled I bought one of these to have Netflix and Pandora on the hotel TV for my wife and I.This little device blew me away, I can do just about everything I wanted to do with an entertainment PC except store content and browse the internet efficiently. And since it can mirror content from other devices and I can side load other streaming apps to run on it, those Cons are nullified and I'm left with almost nothing but Pros to talk about. Instead of an energy hungry, noisy, hot PC stashed behind our TV I have a little dongle plugged into an HDMI port on the TV itself. Win/Win. Now that we're back home, I bought a Fire TV box and another Fire TV Stick to turn the rest of our dumb TVs into Smart TVs.My advice is get one. Now. My only other advice is once you have one, the interface requires a lot of clicking about to get where you want. Don't be afraid to ask Alexa about the thing you're trying to get to or to open. 7 out of 10 times she'll get you to where you want to be. They say she learns the more you utilize her for help."
"3214","First let me begin by saying this review is based on having more than one Fire TV device or having this device and a Amazon Echo.  If you will only have one Fire TV device and NO Echo products, then this would be a five star review.  Now, let me explain:  1.  First, this device works well as access device to a wealth of Amazon content as well as other app access.  It has great video and audio streaming.  The first rub comes when you have MORE than one device.  Amazon will ONLY allow streaming audio to one FIRE device!!!!!  So, if you buy more than one of these and think you will be able to stream music to more than one location in your home, forget it.  ONE location ONLY!!  This is REALLY LAME since if you have more than one echo product (Touch, Dot, Echo) you can stream the same or different audio channels to all devices!  However, as soon as you try to use the Fire TV device to stream it will turn OFF streaming to your Echo devices if you want to stream music to your Fire TV.  You should also know that there is a limit of TWO video streams allowed per prime account!  So, if you have three TVs with three Fire Sticks, you can only stream video to TWO of those TVs!!!  This should be stated in the ad for this device so that people understand the limits!!!!  As it is written, you would expect it to work on ALL device you purchase!!!  2.  Voice command works as expected.  Just remember to KEEP your finger pressed on the mike button when you are asking a question.  If you release the button that will be the end of what Alexa hears.  Also, as opposed to using the echo, you do not need to say ""alexa"" as there is not wake-up required when you press a mike button.  So, just ask your question or give your command.  One nice thing is if you already have an Alexa device that you use (Echo as an example), you can use this to interact with that.  As an example, if you are watching a program and decide you want to place an ingredient in your shopping list, just press the mike button on the remote and tell it to add that ingredient to your shopping list.  It will do it and confirm the addition and then you go back to what you were doing.  3.  You should be aware that there is NO way to turn off this device!  As such, it is NOT compliant with auto switching features if you are using a HDMI auto switch.  The device maintains power to the HDMI interface all of the time so automatic switching does not work.  Also, this device does go into a sort of sleep mode after a period of time.  So, if you switch to the HDMI port on your TV or on your HDMI switch, you may not have any video.  To bring back the signal, just push the home button on the control.  That should be enough to wake it up.  It works on my TVs and on my switch that way.  4.  Amazon support is a real nightmare.  Expect to spend lots of time finding only Q&A sections that are fine for 80% of the basic questions, but will not generally address a problem such as streaming music on more than one device.  Expect silly questions like what CAT level cable you have for Internet when you do get ahold of someone.  They are working a script and you are NOT going to get around it!!!  5.  One last thing, expect the back of the remote to be a GIANT pain to get open!  You can push as much as you want to try and get it to open and it will probably not work.  I finally had to resort to using a pen knife blade point to gently fit in the end to get the case to open.  Just so you know, I had four other people try opening it using the instructions and no one was able to do it.  I have had this same issue on every remote of this type (I have four Amazon Echo devices with this remote and three fire TV devices).All in all, this is a GREAT product as a standalone device if you have NO other Amazon products that stream video or audio.  It is REALLY shaky when you have any of the Echo products and you want to use the Fire TV to stream music.  It is also frustrating if you want to stream video to more than two TVs.  Within those limitations it works well."
"3215","This item is perfect for us. We cannot get satelite because of so many trees. Cable companies don't come out to our house because we are so far in the country. Item was easy to set up, very simple one page directions came with it. That is all I needed. Within 5 minutes I was scanning through and watching movies. The next day I ventured out and used the voice activation. It's the BEST! Love this item can't believe I got so much for such a little cost. I will never pay $100 monthly to the dish companies again."
"3216","These work great I have 5 now and I might get another...convenient work great with my tv remote so i don't have use the remote that came with it unless i want to..."
"3217","The Fire TV Stick works great. It took me a while to figure out how to use it in my TV, but once I did, every App works great. No complaints from this Customer!"
"3218","The firestick was always a very handy device to keep in your travel bag to keep you and friends entertained on trips.The addition of Alexa is a nice plus."
"3219","Tremendous device. Jailbreaking this device for live television was easy by following some simple steps on YouTube.  I love the fire tv stick with Alexa. I love the remote as well because you do not have to aim it at the device for it to correspond. Neat feature."
"3220","Best was to access Amazon and Netflix. My LG ""smart"" TV was getting slower with web service programs. This did the trick. Back to fast uninterrupted streaming."
"3221","Solved a problem I was having with another method of watching Netflix.  This could not have been easier to set up and, with very few complaints, it is easy to use with a clean interface.  I will likely buy another for a similar use."
"3222","No volume control, seriously.I am using my bluetooth headphones to receive audio and cannot adjust the volume because the fire stick has no volume control. I can choose to buy an expensive headphone with volume control plus the fire stick (~ $200) or just buy a Roku and use my cheap bluetooth headphones that I already have (~$30).If you are buying the fire stick to be used with Bluetooth devices, don't bother. Unless the bluetooth device has good volume control."
"3223","I was not the first to jump on the Fire Stick bandwagon, but after testing an older version belonging to a colleague and some prodding from others, I decided to get one for myself.  Initially, it was a bit frustrating that I had to wait for Amazon to restock the device, but I was rewarded with a notification of a much earlier arrival.  The device worked well and provides the streaming services I wanted while remaining simple to use.Great Product and Great Service by Amazon!"
"3224","i love it now, but it kept dropping my network connections and wouldn't work for days. i've since learned that changing the batteries in their slots in the remote makes it connect. i don't know why it works like that but it does.  i am updating my review.  we have  since purchased a new router with more range to cover all our devices.  everything works well and no network dropping.  love my fire stick. i can watch amazon  movies and play some games all on my main t v..  i  used to watch them  on my computer."
"3225","Runs 100 times faster than the original fire sticks.  I like the look of the interface and everything.  I think its worth the couple of extra bucks over the basic fire sticks"
"3226","better than cable"
"3227","I bought this because I have Hulu and Netflix on my computer upstairs where I use a 43'' TV as a monitor.  But I wanted to watch shows on my 70"" TV downstairs without having to buy a complicated set up.  I took me 5 seconds to hook the fire stick up and it works great.  I downloaded the apps and I am good to go.  I recently found out that Alexa can do a lot more than I originally thought.  Just ask her a question and she will provide an answer in most cases.  Want to know what 642 times 18 is...just ask Alexa."
"3228","I love it!!  The best thing created since cable TV.  So easy to use.  Stick it in and off you go! Very user friendly for old people like me who are tech challenged!"
"3229","Great improvements to the firestick. Purchased to replace my first generation firestick which is over 5 years old and struggling to maintain a strong wifi connection. The replacement is fast reliable and the voice integration is quite impressive."
"3230","Finally a stick with some horsepower and 802.11ac wifi.  Runs great and voice control is the bomb."
"3231","Love the Amazon fire tv stick. I have access to more than basic television on my non-smarttv.  The possibility of disconnecting the cable tv if I want to and still have access to channels I watch including Amazon and Netflx channels and also reduce a monthly bill makes me so happy."
"3232","Love it, but I had to buy a separate pre-paid credit card so the channels that I have to pay for will be on my prepaid card, not on my major credit card or debit."
"3233","Very good product. Programming content is outstanding and well worth the cost. Improvement of the on-screen menu structure is recommended for maximum benefit and attraction. Going through the menu options takes longer than needed.I also downloaded the PlayStation Vue app which is also outstanding. I use the Vue subscription primarily so that I can watch the Boston Celtics and Bruins live on CSN and NESN stations."
"3234","Works as expected"
"3235","Compared to the 3 Roku devices I own I would say that the Fire TV Stick is not up to par. Their are a few features that the Fire has that the Roku is missing but visually the way the screen is laid out makes for a lot of searching. The voice remote works good and I have been trying to use this more than searching on the TV. ."
"3236","I love this... this is an addiction.. it should be changed to ""addiction"" stick!  I have Prime Amazon and my options are limited, though.It would be nice to see you guys be able to grow more and take more TV channel options.  I have Dish network and will be happy to drop itin a minute if I can consolidate all this to Amazon.  I am cancelling Netflix already.  I also wonder if you would consider a broader option ofprime that will include all the movies for a higher rate.  Thank you."
"3237","I like the Fire TV Stick.  It does make getting to Amazon Prime very easy.  Not sure about Alexa yet.  She never seems to know what I am looking for.  I'm sure there is a bit of a learning curve with it.  The fire stick is not exactly intuitive to use right out of the box.  Lots of time spent on youtube learning where things are, how to find them and what to do to make things easier to find in the future.I can see this as being a powerful tool once we learn all of it's capacity and how to best use it."
"3238","I got when expected. I was able to hook it up even though I am a senior citizen. I am now enjoying the movies and other benefits. The Fire TV Stick was recommended to me by my daughter."
"3239","The Fire TV Stick gives turns our flat screen into a Smart-TV to access Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other Internet programs. While the device would be easy to install on a flat screen TV resting on a stand, it was somewhat of a challenge to connect the device while the TV was on the wall (and too large to remove from the wall to insert the stick).Overall, the Fire TV Stick is well worth its cost, especially if you have a decent flat panel TV missing the wireless technology for it to be a Smart-TV."
"3240","MUCH more powerful than the last generation. Can multi task much better. Playstation Vue is now usable, Plex is now usable, streaming 1080P large files now works with minimal issue. This is now much closer in performance to the Fire Tv, which is fantastic. The one downside is that this has been crashing every now and again when using flex, but that might be an app issue. Overall great quality, great price and is a swiss army knife for entertainment. I can even play games on this and it be responsive! Finally!!"
"3241","I recommend this device for anyone looking for a Netflix alternative.I enjoy listing to prime music, my TV speakers have an excellent sound system.If your are a PRIME member, setup is a breeze.Alex now answers all my wife questions now, gets me off the hook, LOL'sI did not give 5 stars because ALEXA has some glitches, but not a deal breaker for $30.Note: some smart TV's may have voice activation services built-in, my older samsung smart TV had none, so that's why it was fun for me!"
"3242","Best invention ever. I LOVE mine. There is nothing on regular cable tv so I watch Netflix and Amazon Prime. It's rare that I use my cable anymore. It's easy to use and find something you'd enjoy watching."
"3243","If you have Prime, this is a must have"
"3244","Fire stick worked great right out of the box. No isues at all. I bought 4 of them for all my tv's in my home. nothing but good things to say about the firestick."
"3245","Love this product.  We have three of them now.  They must be a super hot item as we had to wait a month to get them as they were out of stock, but it ok.  Well worth the wait!"
"3246","I love it, I would've given it all 5 star's but, my set up screen is different from my daughter's. I love here's a lot better and the remote has it's ups and downs. I still am learning the many different functions."
"3247","I have problems with it running slow sometimes and there are many things on it that cannot find a stream, but the majority of my problems are using KODI with it."
"3248","Excellent!  I cut the cable and ordered the Fire Stick.  Easy to set up.  I haven't missed a show.  I recommend to anybody cut cable and you will never miss it."
"3249","Great! works exactly has I hoped it would.  I had previously purchased an Amazon Fire for my main TV.  I was concerned that this wouldn't work as well as for the TV in the bedroom or that there would be limitations.  But, it works perfectly.  The HBO and Starz app worked with no problem at all.  Quick to setup.  Wireless works great even though the bedroom is far from the wireless router."
"3250","We love this!  We also have a few Rokus, the Roku 3 and the Roku stick.  This is great because we are able to stream just as many things and the cost was less."
"3251","Easy to install and it works great. Used Netflix, MLB, and Amazon video so far and all fine. I have 75mb/sec speed and WiFi N. No drop outs. Good quality video"
"3252","love this can , so easy to use , works pretty fast as well . thin remote is great and love the new alexa voice feature. easy for the kids to use as well they love watch netflix and hulu"
"3253","An absolute must have for people who have older flatscreen TVs that don't have built-in wireless.  And actually for $39, this is a must-have for everyone even if you do have Wireless smart TVs. The voice remote itself is worth $39."
"3254","Perfect for getting rid of Cable.  I've installed some apps on it to watch all of my regular shows, so I get to lose the $200 cable bill.  Love saving money!!!"
"3255","Awesome product and a great price. I use it for netflix and prime movies. It is hooked into my receiver as an HDMI input and works well with my tv and surround sound."
"3256","Love it! The apps on my smart TV have been finicky here lately, so I decided on the fire stick as a good workaround. It runs all my streaming apps very well, as well as my Sling TV account that I use for sports and other things that I want to watch live. It's also nice that I can move it from room to room to whatever TV I'm using at the moment, or take it on vacation with me. It's also much easier and convenient than using my laptop. I'll probably end up getting a couple more for the other TVs in my house."
"3257","got it set up,hooked up, Awesome....it plays just Fantastic...with VOICE CONTROL...YAY....that remote control is just so small...gotta keep up with it though~~"
"3258","It seems to work fine but I wish there was an all in one solution. I still need my Google chrome cast to play my stars, Showtime, direct, and other content from my phone. I also do not like that it does not interact with my Echo dot. But it functions well and I can finally use the video part of my prime video on a large screen."
"3259","Worked exactly as I was hoping to do!  Easy, clear installation instructions. Works great!  I like having the extra hand-held remote rather than having to use my own phone since I may need to move and use the Fire TV stick on multiple TVs, that may not be in my own house, so someone else can use the remote rather than be dependent on my personal cellphone."
"3260","I don't know what took me so long to get the fire stick. It is awesome !!! I especially like all the music choices there are, the playlist are sweet. So far, the only thing I miss is the live sports ( the Seattle Mariners ) and news. The voice command remote is sooo cool. I think with a little tweekin' and learning all that it does will only make it better"
"3261","So easy to set up and enjoy! Love the simple layout and super easy,  user friendly remote. It's brought the ""boardgame"" back to our family. My teen kids and I love playing the games together. For group games just use your cell phone as your remote to play! The Alexa feature is nice too. I often use it for a quick check on tomorrow's forecast."
"3262","I've run into quite a few apps I can't put on this and I'm disappointed by that. It's great for Netflix of course and Hulu but several not tv apps I can't put on here. I hope that changes"
"3263","Outstanding!  I absolutely love it.  Does everything a smart TV does at a fraction of the price.  I couldn't be happier.  So long spectrum and your high rates!"
"3264","Feels like I have a personal robot!Kind of scary for me at first that Alexa understoodme so well as well as my grandkids.  I have come into the21st century......LOL"
"3265","I haven't had a lot of time to watch lately, but I love the convenience of simply asking Alexa to find something instead of scrolling around as I have to do with some other services."
"3266","Picture quality is very nice; works nearly flawlessly with Amazon apps and Netflix. Sadly, the apps for Hulu and CBS All Access are deeply, fundamentally flawed. I returned this item because if it can't at least stream Netflix AND Hulu, then it's not the TV stick for me."
"3267","The firestick adds a great deminsion to TV on demand! With busy schedules and family programming, it allows you to focus on what you want to watch when you want to watch it!"
"3268","Should have bought this the first time instead of the Roku simply because I can put the Kodi app on this and watch whatever I want. Great for military overseas"
"3269","I will order another one!  The money I'm saving in incredible!!!Installation simple and ease.  Delivers on its promise.A must have for every household"
"3270","This device has issues streaming from Hulu and Netlix.  The shows get all grainy as if the buffering has slowed down.  However, this device is connected to my 5GHz AC Wireless Network (with only 3 devices connected) and should not have any speed or buffering issues. I am a Network Engineer, so I know it is not my network. No other streaming device in my home has this issue. Its only the Firestick that cannot seem to buffer fast enough which causes the picture/video to get all grainy."
"3271","This is an amazing little device.  Love the Alexa voice remote.  ""Fast forward two minutes""  is an amazingly useful feature. You never really notice how much you search for shows until you no longer have to type the searches.  ""Show me Tom Criuse movies"". Its that simple.  Plus the ability to access Netflix and even download Kodi app.  This little stick is amazing.  Amazon has done an amazing job with the password entry and parental controls.  I don't think i will ever go back to cable again.  Thanks Amazon."
"3272","Excellent w/ Kodi"
"3273","Once my son-in-law set it up for me, it was easy! When you're technically illiterate this is easy to use. I did have some buffering issues, but my son fixed the problem"
"3274","I can't believe I took so long to get this set up. I never leave reviews unless I am blown away. I was used to an old blue ray that constantly stopped to buffer. This is nothing like that.. I am not tech savvy. But within a half hour I had it up and running with my Hulu and Netfix accounts set up within. And no problems at all with the voice control. It understood every word I spoke.Great product. I highly recommend it. And if you have Amazon Prime, they preload it with your setting. Just an added bonus."
"3275","This is a neat little gadget that makes it possible to watch NetFlix and Amazon Prime on our TV. The Voice Remote works very well and is surprisingly easy to use. We are really enjoying it!"
"3276","Not what I thought it was. Almost everything requires cable subscription.  If I had a cable subscription I wouldn't need fire tv. Very disappointed. The one highlight was I can stream Daystar and TBN. It also freezes and my tv screen goes black. I have been trying to watch a show on prime and it continues to shut down. While others may have had success with this product it is not for me."
"3277","This had been a great replacement for cable tv but I give three stars because it tends to overheat quite frequently.  We have to plug it out even when we are not watching tv."
"3278","Waited a few days before installing, read and reread install directions. Not that they are complex, just wanted to be sure of what I needed and what I would be doing. Easy installation. The Alexa Voice makes searches simple."
"3279","The new Fire Stick is fantastic. It exceeded my expectations. It is much faster than anything I've used previously and I have access to my Amazon instant video library, Amazon music library, Netflix, YouTube and many other apps that I like to use. The Alexa voice remote is pretty cool too, you can use it to load apps and skip around while watching movies and tv shows, and I've only just begun to discover all of its many functions and uses. For the $39 price, the Fire Stick is definitely worth every penny."
"3280","I bought this as a gift for my nephew from my prime account. Apparently amazon takes it upon themselves to load all of my prime photos to the fire stick not knowing it's being given to someone else. This should be a option when ordering but maybe I missed it. Either way I wasn't happy with the way that went down.Edit... apparently I didn't check the ""this is a gift"" box so it was my fault for my nephew getting all of my pictures.MAKE SURE TO CHECK THIS IS A GIFT BOX IF YOUR GIVING THIS AS A GIFT"
"3281","Just amazing... I've been avoiding the Amazon Fire TV stick for a while but I don't know why... In the end, I decided to buy it. Well, I really regret that time of avoidance... Fire TV stick is just amazing with all the options and possibilities that you can add to it. Unlike other streaming products I already have, this one will allow you to do almost whatever you want beside primary working with Amazon prime which is also not bad at all.No issues at all so far. Only pros and no cons... Time will judge."
"3282","The remote does not work unless the batteries are manually pushed into the contacts. I struggled with the unit initially, put it aside, tried on a couple more occasions (changed batteries, looked up user manual...not being a ""techie"" I thought it was me.) It's really no good without a usable remote. Of course, the return window is closed. Had to download an app to operate from my phone. Not really impressed at all."
"3283","Returned after the millionth time it started playing music when I asked it to go back (or forward) 2 minutes.Hoping for a better version soon, maybe the extra star will help them! 😉"
"3284","This is my 2nd one and I luv it.  Easy setup with an HDMI CABLEI appreciate the enclosed extender.Can't beat the price and free ship on Amazon prime membership"
"3285","Bought this as a second Fire TV Stick for my friend's bedroom. She already has one in the living room. She is very excited about finally having one in her room."
"3286","Plug it in and follow the directions. I have all of my AV equipment set up on one remote controller. It took me a minute to realize that I had to manually select the proper HDMI port from the input menu. Duh!  I love having so many choices for my viewing pleasure - right at my fingertips 😁"
"3287","I have no idea how to do all of the cool stuff with it as advertised such as order a pizza using Alexa w/voice remote but so far I'm pleased with my purchase."
"3288","Works way better and faster than the apps on my DVD player.  We cut the cable and only use an antenna and the fire stick for prime content, Netflix and music."
"3289","Works great on my Samsung TV. Easy to set up and has access to my favorite apps, Netflix and Amazon Prime videos. Wasn't interested in the gaming and extra storage on Amazon TV, the Fire Stick works great for my needs."
"3290","I've got a total of 5 fire tv sticks, two of the remotes work great. The other 3 remotes don't want to work correctly when trying to select a program for favorites. The three bars doesn't want to bring up the selection options. Not sure why yet. Other than that the fire stick itself works great, nice choice of programs when you have your prime membership."
"3291","This has been a fantastic investment.. Upgraded the wi-fi and axed the cable and will save  over a hundred dollars a month.. Once you add the KODI APP YOUR set ... I should have done this along time ago....."
"3292","I currently stream through Apple TV and have to use the AirPlay feature to watch Amazon Video on my TV.  Since this is inconvenient due to the location of my computer, I decided to purchase a device to allow me to directly stream Amazon Video through my TV (and likely replace my Apple TV).Out of the box, the All-New Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote was quick & easy to set up and I was watching Amazon video on my TV in just a few minutes.  The most difficult aspect of setup was getting the battery compartment on the remote to open (which I noticed numerous others have mentioned) - a serious flaw - I have good manual dexterity and it was actually quite difficult for me.  I was impressed that someone thought to have the welcome/introduction video play automatically during the short wait for the system to be configured.  The voice remote was fun to play with but I doubt it will get very much use in my home, as we mostly watch series and the results from the voice search don't take you to the correct episode in your queue.  I imagine it would be more useful for finding movies, or shows that are not yet in your watch lists.  Picture resolution is fantastic and color is vibrant (actually so vibrant and rich that I found I preferred a less-vibrant color setting on my TV).  I was really excited at first, and expected that it might replace our Apple TV.  This was not to last for long however, as I was disappointed that the only way to view your watch list for both Amazon and Netflix are by scrolling through a carousel (which is cumbersome at best - unless you only have a few titles saved - and I doubt very many people fit in this category).  Although not directly the fault of Amazon Fire Stick (since they are apps), I thought I would mention it in case you are expecting your Netflix or Amazon Video watch list to look & perform the way it does on computer or Kindle Fire (or Apple TV for Netflix).  If it were priced any higher I likely would have returned it - but since it does allow me to watch Amazon on my TV, I'll be keeping it."
"3293","we love this little piece of equipment! access to tons of programming and it's super easy to install and navigate. my kids have fun asking Alexa questions too!!"
"3294","I do not have a smart tv, so this gets me to Amazon Prime on my big flat screen.  However, I never could get the Alexa Voice Remote to work...disappointed because I specifically wanted the voice remote for this product.  I would give this more stars if the voice direction worked."
"3295","Tons of content available to watch. No need for cable tv ever again. And the ability to load apps make it perfect. Bought 2 and buying another on cyber monday!"
"3296","I love love love my fire stick w/ Alexa voice everything I need  at my finger tips I even bought a extra fire stick as a gift for my mom she enjoys her's as well all the movies & tv show"
"3297","Not sure what I would do without my fire stick and streaming Amazon programs now.  Love how I get suggestions, and can add to my watchlist.We have two now."
"3298","Love the things I can have with this amazing little instrument.  I love seeing the movies and listening to music that I want to hear.  Best $40. dollars I have spent in a long time."
"3299","It works perfect,easy to install, no problems at all.I did have one problem with netflix password but called and they helped me immediately. Very very pleased"
"3300","Why does the new stick display over the screen boundaries?  If I recall I didn't need to adjust this at all with the previous stick.  When looking for the place to reduce the display in the stick Settings/Display, all that I was able to do was read their suggestion that I “simply adjust the zoom or overscan setting on your TV.”, which for my TV only offers 16:9 or 4:3.  Not so simple.Please, at least make it the same plus better."
"3301","Happy with my order"
"3302","Only having installed the Firestick a week ago I'm still in the learning phase but from what I've been able to do , watch and play I believe this is an outstanding investment."
"3303","Everything worked great in the beginning then after the update, I can't get anything to work right. Movies buffer, links don't play at all.  I even had it replaced and it it's doing the exact same thing. I'm not sure what's going on. Use to work perfectly and I even bought 3 of many family members 1each and I also bought a 2 year warranty for mine."
"3304","Lots of freebies included with numerous channels/content for your viewing pleasure. Easy to set up. Sorry we waited so long to try it. We are ordering 2 more."
"3305","Not as easy to set up as anticipated.  Still trying to figure it out months later.  Was hoping that it would replace the cable bill... So far, that hasn't occurred.  Still googling and seeing how to get the service I had anticipated.  It is possible that I had higher expectations than it could handle."
"3306","Nice product, seems to be well made (comes from China of course), it works as advertised, set up is easy.  Just wish they would slightly re-design the Fire TV Stick to include a power ON/OFF switch on the remote, so that AC Adapter Power is NOT always being supplied INTO to the Fire TV Stick itself.  Power to the Fire TV Stick is NOT needed when viewing ""anything"" from a different HDMI Port (such as: Cable, Set Top Box, DVD Player, etc.) onto your TV set.  The Alexa Voice feature works very well."
"3307","I love it,  it I ha he to figure out some more stuff. Pretty Awesome!!!"
"3308","Enjoying the Fire Stick so far mainly to watch Acorn and Sling TV. Haven't really tried Alexa."
"3309","I purchased this for an older tv that I mounted in my kitchen along with an antenna. I find myself using the fire stick 95% of the time. I'm not a fan of signing in to all the apps again (I have a roku tv in the other room), but it's totally worth it. I found the fire stick to be snappier than the Samsung smart tv apps and the roku tv. I plan on buying a second one for my bedroom tv (currently using an older Xbox 360 for apps). The fire stick'a remote is awesome- no useless buttons, small size, and it's not line of sight."
"3310","All in all, I'm pretty happy with my purchase of the Amazon fire stick. I really don't feel that the dramatically enhances my current packages with the cable companies, do not save much money. Access to network, sports and news outlets is almost nonexistent. That said, sure do get a lot of movies and music. For the $39.99 paid, and considering I'm an Amazon prime member, It's pretty cool.Still, would only recommend if you had those other outlets in place."
"3311","I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and I loved it so much that I bought one for my apartment too. It’s so simple to use and the set up is so quick. In addition it’s so fast. I bought it on Black Friday, so it was on sale. I honestly never thought I’d get something so great for the amount of money I spent. Pleasantly surprised. Perfect Christmas gifts for college students. Say goodbye to the days of using HDMI cables to stream your computer on your tv!"
"3312","I love my Fire TV Stick! I own 3! They are a great addition to your tv and with Alexa Voice control it is a great help when searching for something. Kudos for coming up with a handy, easy to take along accessory!"
"3313","The little stick brought my 8 year old spareroom tv to life! I can now use it to stream movies and music just like my new smart tv. I would buy another for my son's room, but since this is portable I don't have to. I did have some network problems when I first hooked it up, but after I restarted my router it has been fine."
"3314","Although it processes just slightly slower than our Fire TV, it is barely noticeable. Apps like You Tube that are glitchy through our Samsung Smart TV work very smoothly through the Fire Stick. I would recommend it to anyone even ad a supplement to a Smart TV."
"3315","Strongly recommend. I have an echo and an echo dot also so you could say I am biased :-) but this just works effortlessly. Good programing from Amazon although I wish they would bring back the next season of Alpha House."
"3316","The Fire TV Stick with the Alexa Voice remote is awesome. I can just ask Alexa to search for movies and tv shows and its right there without having to look through everything. I love it. And its easy to use."
"3317","Does what it's supposed to. Not earth shattering. Already had Echo Dot and regular fire stick and Xfinity with voice control, so not new to the idea. It's gimmicky rather than practical. However, the batteries are garbage. After only just over a week of use they are needing to be replaced."
"3318","We previously had a couple of Roku boxes..both quit working about the same time. We replaced one with this item. We LOVE it! Even has voice ...works great, no problems, easy install...(really easy!!) Coupled with Amazon Prime? You betcha! The movies are a treat and we still stream Netflix."
"3319","My husband wanted this and I have to admit that I didn't really know how much I would love it until we had it! If you have Prime then this is a must have that you will want to have in order to take advantage of all the Prime movies/tv shows, on your home TV. Works seamlessly. Love the talk feature. No complaints!"
"3320","This is my second purchase.  My previous 1st generation stopped working and I needed new one.  Liked the old one, just hope this doesn't just stop working after one year."
"3321","I have the fire stick and the fire TV gaming edition. I love both of them! I'm thinking about buying another one for myself and a couple more for gifts. Highly recommend!"
"3322","Don't get me wrong, I love my Chromecast also but this completed the gap.  I can now stream Amazon music instead of only what I purchased.  Very quick.  Love it."
"3323","I'm learning to use my new fire stick. So far-so good. It was easy to set up-plug the fire stick into a HDMI port, plug the power cord into an outlet. The device sees your network, you navigate the password and that's about it. Two things-the remote is very small and I had a difficult time to open and install the batteries. I needed a very small screw driver to open it. Second, I may be missing something here, but Amazon refers to Prime Video. Is that a general generic term for video. I see Prime Movies, Prime Series, Prime Channels, etc., but not Prime Video.Some items are subscription, many are free.Prime Photos is a cool feature. I just bought my first smart phone, so I am new to this. You take a photo with your phone. Download a photo app from Amazon Prime Photos. Now, you can send that photo to your fire stick tv and see your pics on a big screen in Prime Photos. That photo will also be sent and saved to Amazon's cloud storage, so only send those photos you want."
"3324","She's just a stick, and she's on fire. Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway. She's living in a world, and it's on fire. Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can play away. Oh, she got both plugs in the back. And she's streaming it down. Oh, she pulling from the cloud. And she's not slowing down. This stick is on fire. This stick is on fire. She's streaming like fire. This stick is on fire."
"3325","Great Fire stick TV for my cord cutting cable and works fine with all my TVs.  Yes, sometimes it locks up or does not come on my Tv and I have to restart it."
"3326","I love the Fire Stick! Great for running Netflix, Amazon Video and Kodi. Also has some fun games you can play.  The Alexa voice portion is a nice added bonus."
"3327","Downloaded Kodi onto the firestick.  No need for cable anymore. Also, amazon prime has a lot of really good original series, Goliath and Good Girls Revolt are two must see shows."
"3328","We're so pleased with this.  Installed quickly/easily on our TV and gives us so much more availability to watch shows and movies (we have Amazon prime).  It's also fabulous because we take it on vacation with us and hook up to the TV.  So much better than taking a stack of DVDs."
"3329","I have had Apple TV for the past 5 years it was doing a good job. However, I have Amazon Prime and my TV is not compatible with Prime. I couldn't see spending the money for Prime and not getting the full benefit so I bought the fire stick. I do like the voice activation, it makes it a lot easier to find shows etc than going through search. I am disappointed that we are still having to pay to watch a lot of movies. I would think between Netflix and the Fire Stick that should be enough but it still isn't."
"3330","I already own a firestick so I'm pleased with it's capabilities! I gave it 3 stars because I ordered 3 as gifts. I opened the first one to set it up for my parents & the remote is defected! I even switched batteries to see if that was it,  but it's the remote. I constantly had to take the batteries out & put them back in,  it freezes to the point I have to CONSTANTLY tap on the buttons to get it to do anything.  It took me 10 mins to register my mom account so they can use it. Very disappointed in that!"
"3331","Loved the Fire TV Stick already, and this one with Alexa is even better. Such a pleasure to sit down to relax with a good show and not have to try to remember which streaming service it's on."
"3332","Had some trouble with streaming and buffering the 1st movie we watched with it.  We have very fast internet from ATT.  Not the fastest offered but nearly the fastest.  Yet the movie stopped for buffering about four times.  After the movie ended, I checked the settings and found the Fire TV Stick was giving recommendations for improved performance.  I applied those recommendations including changing our WiFi channel from channel 1 to channel 4.  We'll see very soon if those adjustments fixed the problem."
"3333","So far it has worked perfectly, I have used it once. I know you want feedback but you should wait at least a few weeks if you want more accurate data. I am happy so far."
"3334","I love the Fire Stick. I had the little box before, and that worked great, but when it died I decided to try out the Cheaper option.  It is working perfectly!"
"3335","We are preparing to make the cutting cable switch and wanted to ease into it.  The Fire Stick was easy to open and easy to set up.  We are enjoying Fire TV more than we have our Chromecast.  We currently have this set up on our older television in our bedroom.  The voice remote works well and is easy to use.  This is a great buy for those looking to test the waters of being cable free.  We have Amazon Prime and Netflix and for the most part with those and the Fire Stick our tv viewing needs are being met."
"3336","This is amazing. Wish I bought it sooner. The 40.00 one is just fine and does everything. I don't have 4k so if you don't have 4k don't waste your money on the expensive one."
"3337","More than happy with this! Has saved me so much money and have no further need for high, and continuously raising cable or satellite bills!! I went from having to either hook my computer up to my tv to watch my Amazon or Netflix account to having both right where I need them without needing to buy an expensive new ""Smart TV"" as this makes any TV smart!!!"
"3338","love it so far"
"3339","Awesome product, I now use this for my Netflix and it is amazing the voice search is the best on this, I own an Echo and 2 Echo Dots all my Amazon products are amazing. Keep up the amazing work."
"3340","The picture on the tv is great with this for watching all my Prime shows/movies, etc., but it won't work with my Bose surround sound.  I have to use the TV speakers -- disappointing."
"3341","Easy to install if you have your network security code available to get into your secured router. It found my router quick Strong single and good upload and streaming."
"3342","By far, the easiest, most effective streaming device that exists. Took not even 5 minutes to set up. Everything you need is included, works beyond excellent. Suggest this for everyone seeking a streaming device."
"3343","Fantastic product. Had it set up in under 90 seconds! Super easy to log into my accounts on cable channel apps and Alexa is a great addition! I can simply power the fire stick on and say ""play Netflix"" into the remote and it pops right up. The only thing I can think would make it better is if the remote had volume control. Currently it does not."
"3344","Alexa is not as useful as advertised and has limited hardware compatibility with the TV. Tried it for a few weeks and found the overall system to be clunky and difficult to navigate.Probably going to give away."
"3345","This is extremely easy to install and use.  I've just begun to explore what it and Alexa can do.  Asking for something is much quicker than navigating the so many options just in Amazon Prime, for example.  I will be dropping HBO through Spectrum and picking it up through Amazon, too. This is much more sensible t.v. than the cable option."
"3346","I've seldom ordered a product that I have been happier with than the Fire TV stick. It was so simple to set up that I hope to buy a second one for our other TV very soon. I am very pleased with the value from the Prime Membership, too."
"3347","It's a firestick..what more is their to say. Works fine and should last a long time. Buy one or two. Opens a whole new world of entertainment. Not sure what it is or what it does... google it. Best bang for the buck in streaming media."
"3348","I love the ease of switching from my satellite service to the Fire Stick but I do wish it were easier to find television shows I like you have to download different apps to get movies and television shows not original to Amazon. We enjoy the music and a few of the more familiar apps. I came across a few poorly made films that I should have checked the reviews for first. I thinking about dumping my satellite service all together but I have to be able to easily access the shows I currently like to watch."
"3349","I've only had to Fire TV Stick for a few weeks but so far it's exceeded my expectations.  I've had the Fire TV for a while for my TV in the family room and purchased the Stick for my bedroom TV.  I had read that the Stick wasn't as good as the Fire TV but so far I haven't seen a difference.  Probably the biggest advantage of the Fire TV or the Stick is you and add storage to the Fire TV but you can't on the Stick.  That hasn't been an issue thus far but as I download more apps it could become an issue."
"3350","This product delivers!  I have been able to watch what I want and when I want to, with high quality. Yes, you may have to hunt around a little for your source.  But I don't consider that an issue.  FYI...We had a little trouble trying to figure out how to get ""in"" the first time, but a search on youtube brought up step by step instructions.  Easy peasy - just remember that you follow that navigation in each time.  Again, for what I'm getting, - not a problem!  Freedom! --It's a beautiful thing!"
"3351","Not as expectedCons:1. Very Confusing Interface2. Bad Parental Control. Even after enabling parental controls, my 2 year old son has subscribed for Starz.3. Ad's in the top. Since we bought this device, I didn't expect to see ad's on the top.4. Chromecast is not supported by fire stick by default. It's only app based5. No option to control or delete Prime Photos. Since we store all our photos and videos in Prime Photos, we are concerned when ever my son opens Prime photos infant of our friends."
"3352","Best 30 dollars I spent in a while.. Watch anything u want I'm new to it so I'm trying to find out how to live stream TV I have watched some channel but can't find most download kodi. U really don't need cable anymore"
"3353","The Fire TV Stick meets all my expectations. I purchased this because my roommate had the previous model and it seemed to work well for him. My previous ""smart"" device was a blu-ray player that was very slow, very laggy and lacked many apps. Honestly, I haven't had any problem with this product however have had many positives.Pros:- fast-no lag-many apps available-super easy set up-no problem linking accounts for apps such as Spotify, Netflix, CW App, MTV app, etc."
"3354","Absolutely love my fire stick. I did notice that the remote with Alexa voice control went through batteries a lot faster though. That is reason why i gave 4 stars. 5 stars for the original fire stuck though. Love how you can upgrade the fire stick to your liking also."
"3355","We love it!!! It does freeze once in awhile and needs to be reset but it's just when we had direct tv. It froze at times. But it has great movies and shows."
"3356","This is our second Fire Stick and this one came with Alexa.  Have only used Alexa to play Amazon music but it works great.  I highly recommend this product."
"3357","These sticks constantly have issues....overheat, drop wireless signal and need to be reset.....change from regular wifii to 5g wifi....""opps error""."
"3358","Lightning took out my last one, so new one.  The Alexa part doesn't work so well. I talk to it and it doesn't comprehend.  But I don't care, so only 4 stars"
"3359","I enjoy watching movies and videos I had not seen.  The volume is the problem.  I have to adjust the volume constantly.  Maybe your techs. can work on that."
"3360","Works wonderfully.  Replacing my Roku box for this because I use Kodi a lot, and was tired of hooking my computer up to the TV to use apps through Kodi.  Definitely Recommend this product."
"3361","Great Device. Amazon made a great add on here.  Switched from Roku as you have more options with the Firestick.  Very fast and love the RF remote that works through the walls."
"3362","A little confusing to start but after exploring we are getting the hang of it. We bought it to use in master bed and see if it would be worth getting rid of cable boxes. Still up in the air about that one.  Only gave a 4 star because sometimes it lacks quality and speed but for $40 is pretty nice to turn our tv into a smart tv."
"3363","Was using my ps4 to watch all my movie apps. And the fire stick does it with ease. And let’s me search a great deal more. Can take it anywhere with ease. And pretty user friendly."
"3364","Its good. But the control aweful. I have to keep putting in new baterries and it stops working have to take out the batteries and put them back in.  Its getting annoying."
"3365","Frankly, I haven't had a chance to 'experience' the tvstick.  However, I'm beginning to think my husband may consider this the 'other woman' in his life!! :)  It is AWESOME!"
"3366","Gift item , I have my friends and family's on standby. Cable tv imo is overpriced. I can watch what I want on my terms. I got the power thanks fire tv stick"
"3367","I believe this is an improvement over the basic Amazon TV Firestick due to the Alexa voice command and the larger size. I have been happy with the purchase."
"3368","Wow!  The easiest and fastest  of it's kind.  The voice remote is a plus but it's made working between our devices much easier.  Our DVD player has a Netflix function that too forever to load.  Not the Fire stick... seamlessly goes from Netflix to Amazon Prime.  Not a technical person at all so if you aren't this is a great way to go (I have the google stick and I stopped using it because it kept requiring me to reload it on my phone for operation)  Like it so much I'm considering a Dot or an Alexa..."
"3369","The Amazon Fire TV Stick is Amazing!After purchasing the Amazon Fire TV (which has an ethernet port) for my living room television, and having a great experience, I purchased two additional Amazon Fire TV Sticks (only works with WiFi) for two bedrooms.  I removed the small computer sticks from the bedroom tvs and replaced them with the Amazon Fire Sticks, and am very pleased with their flawless function.I'm SOLD on the Amazon Fire TV line.  Major League KUDOS to the Developers!  :)"
"3370","I have read so many reviews before I bought this......TILL I WAS CONFUSED. Bottom line..it does not replace your TV...Nor does it replace your  cable subscription...I cancelled my cable... And glad i did..I wanted to do that for some time. Some of my TV shows i may have to buy..Big deal....The great thing  about Fire TV, you have an abudance of FREE stuff from Amazon. Being a Prime Member in my opinion is the way to go to enjoy all the benefits Amazon has to offer...If you don't like it.......Return it"
"3371","I love it but ... I have been getting a lot of network errors , playback errors and Alexa doesn't work all the time . I have an Apple TV as well and it works perfectly fine it is connected to same tv and everything. I power cycle and it's ok for a few hours but I want a more permanent fix it is highly annoying having to power cycle ever day sometimes 3 times a day. When it works it is a great product."
"3372","Having difficult time getting it lined p with my android device, but am watching my first movie finally.  Got an instruction with print I can see so am hoping to get to be an expert"
"3373","Disappointed I even thought about not buying this. I have had one time where it was skipping but after about 10 seconds it figured it's stuff out and has been working perfect since. I'm able to take it with me on vacation and that's awesome!!  Pandora, Netflix and HBO Go are why I purchased this and they all work great. Speaking to Alexa is different since I have the Xbox Kinect commands memorized but the commands I do know work. All around great buy. I thought about buying one for my siblings for Christmas. Maybe I will."
"3374","Easily the best thing I have and ever will purchase from amazon! they did a great job building this product. Simple, easy, perfect. great TV shows through prime video and movies as well. if they can keep adding good shows and movies I can easily stop my netflix account (but i have my fire stick hooked up to netflix so maybe not)"
"3375","I love this fire stick so far and there is so many things you can do and thousands of TV shows and movies all that you can stream, it's great and I loved that Alexa came with it too."
"3376","Love the  2 fire sticks with Alexa voice.  Now I have a fire stick on all of our televisions.So much for such a low price.I'm an Amazon Girl!!!"
"3377","I have a samsung smart tv that's buffering constantly with amazon and Netflix. Since I've been using the fire stick, everything has been streaming smoothly!"
"3378","This stick turned my OLD flatscreen upstairs into a smart tv! It was easy to set up, and easy to navigate. I can now stream my prime, Netflix and Hulu upstairs without having to buy a smart tv. Wonderful investment!"
"3379","Easy to install & set-up. Works like a charm."
"3380","My internet could be faster but it works and shows great. I wish I could get Alexa voice to work in an app. I end up typing just so I can be more specific."
"3381","Didn't know that using the Fire Stick would be that easy and expand viewing possibilities or would have purchased it much sooner.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase.  No more network TV unless I want to.  Yeah!"
"3382","We love watching Netflix and amazon with our new firestick. Had no problem hooking up. Had problems with frozen screen. Followed all instructions on amazon site on how to fix frozen remote.Changed original batteries first day. Then tv memo came on stating batteries low. So will change again. I see many sites about frozen firestick so I'm assuming there are ongoing problems with firestick. Hope it all gets better."
"3383","So far I love this  item I thought I had to have an Alexa here but it works without anything else just works off The TV so you can talk to it I love it so far"
"3384","I had a lot of issues with this stick. Until now not sure if due to the a lot of up and downs on my internet GB banwith or simply this was a defective product. I move to a different city recently. Only one of two issues so far."
"3385","We love this fire stick. We have a new tv but, not a smart tv. We also passed on cable subscriptions. The stick, along with our prime, Netflix, Hulu and sling give us everything we want on television. We save a lot of money. This stick and prime combined are winners."
"3386","Works really well on everything except Alexa which is still pretty dumb. I have a problem with asking her to play music because it doesn't play it in the background and you can't control the song once you use Alexa so it's kind of pointless but use it every day still"
"3387","Can not beat this stick! Use it in vacation home for full connect to all our programs.Only problem is Too much TV to watch. Bad for the addictive watchers."
"3388","Haven't figured it all out but what I do know, I like it. was having trouble streaming movies so ordered this and now I can stream much better and quicker."
"3389","Bought as a Christmas gift, but gave early due to illness and recovery. Folks couldn’t have been happier. Had many more options while resting on the couch."
"3390","We use it mostly to watch Netflix. We used to connect our laptop to TV every time but now it is not necessary. It is really convenient. Also we took the fire stick with us on vacation and simply plugged it in the TV in our hotel room. It works fine."
"3391","I have Chromecast ($40), AppleTV ($160), and Fire TV ($40).  The Chromecast is in a drawer, it was not user friendly.  The Fire TV is really good.  I love Apple products, and the Apple TV has some good apps.  But the Fire TV has all the apps I want.  The Apple TV remote is a pain to use..there is limited tactile feedback and it is always making mistakes.  The Fire TV remote feels good and works well.  The Apple TV won't speak, and the Fire TV can tell me the weather and answer questions --- Fire TV wins."
"3392","I absolutely love my Fire Stick!! Alexa makes watching TV easier than I ever imagined (and probably easier than my lazy self needs). I have access to all of my favorites, PLUS more. Streaming is buffer free and I can even listen to my favorite playlists from Spotify. Thanks to the simple installation and only requiring a HDMI port, I was able to turn an older TV into a smart TV instead of spending tons more on a new smart TV. Honestly, my Amazon Fire Stick is one of my favorite purchases of the year."
"3393","Very difficult to navigate. I did not like the delay when clicking on desired channels or having to sign in for everything. Much too time consuming also the lack of live local tv news was a major disappointment for me."
"3394","would buy again"
"3395","Only used it 3 times but it was fun to watch some old western shows without commercials!  Can't wait to kick back in this summer heat and enjoy more shows."
"3396","Very pleased with my new fire stick, it's technology as I would never have imagined possible as a kid. I do need to upgrade my router now as it is not up to the task demands of fire stick and Alexa."
"3397","I bought this item to replace my expensive cable bill.  So far so good!"
"3398","Cancelled Dish , now I'm paying $37 with PS Vue , has all the channel I watch. TruTV beIN sport Fox deportes , I can use my login to each separate networks on the go amazing.  Unable to locate App I just add it with my laptop, already installed fire stick. Using old Led TV is fine, little of lag to lunch apps, Does not go as fast as my DroidTv.  For the price , we love it. Makes the old tv smart lol."
"3399","Smartest buy I have ever made.  Love, love, love my fire stick.  It makes watching Amazon Prime, Netflix and other shows so much easier to load and stream."
"3400","Works great! Quick response.  Going to get one for lower level.  Only problem I have is menu .  Different from menu on kindle for video which is easy .  Haven't figured out fire stick menu for movies."
"3401","I bought the Fire Stick last week and it arrived on Sunday (2 day delivery). I loved it right away and promptly ordered 2 more and now all 3 TVs are hooked up. Hooking and setting up was a breeze. I have cable but feel like I've been flushing money down the toilet the last few years because I don't watch it. Netflix and Amazon Prime along with my DVDs are all I watch. Can't wait to start saving money. Also had not been able to access Netflix through the xBox for over 4 days so unhooking that didn't break my heart."
"3402","We already were Amazon Prime members, this was to make viewing easier than using the X-Box 360 for Amazon content.  Wish the price was less, but works great for adding to our Dishnetwork options.  We would consider programming through Fire but have rural line of sight internet and the bandwith available won't support multiple TV and program streaming."
"3403","this is as great as the new roku stick which I had till it went goofy on me.  voice works well on this and current items you are watching means not having to dig for them.  only minor bad things are, getting lid off remote to insert batteries in awkward and warranty is only 90 days so I bought 2 year coverage as extra. (did not take off star for that because with it, it is still cheaper that roku)  UPDATE: 03/20/17  for the last week the HBO Now has not worked and I tried everything, still no good. Now the warranty people said they will not cover this because Amazon warranty is still in effect.  Amazon warranty is ONLY 90 DAYS so the SquareTrade is worthless.  DO NOT BUY EXTENDED WARRANTY.  I WOULD NOT BUY THIS FIRESTICK AGAIN AS AMAZON WARRANTY IS TOO SHORT"
"3404","Love my stick"
"3405","I LOVE my new Fire Stick.  It was easy to install and I haven't had any problems with it.  The best feature is the Alexa voice remote.  That makes it easy to search for what you're looking for.  My grandchildren ages 7 and 5 are able to use this without problems.  I will be purchasing several to give as gifts."
"3406","Could not be simpler to set up.  Plugged into HDMI of AV Receiver (not TV), and worked the first time I turned it on.  Now I have sound through the strereo just like when I watch TV.  So simple to use.  Was worried about buffering being wireless, and if you didn't know better, you would think it is hard wired."
"3407","If Amazon would allow Google apps such as music and movies to work on the fire stick, I would've bought a second stick instead of a Chromecast.  Also, I don't know who's to blame for HBO Go not working between Charter cable and the  fire stick/tv, but they need to figure it out and give the consumers what they want."
"3408","Ten times better than chromecast I don't have any amazon products besides this and I highly recommend it. You don't have to connect it to your phone, it connects to wifi itself, there are tons of apps and games and everything is super easy to use. Just get it"
"3409","Love it. Unfortunately I had one purchased in Dec 2016 just fail. Complete loss wireless connections to remote, router and even the iOS remote app. Recommend to purchase the extended warranty plan."
"3410","Love it!!! I feel am really in control of what l watch on TV!!!  I just wish you had more Christian channels, but other than that it was money well spent!!!"
"3411","If you have Amazon prime, you need one of these.  It's a great device.  Allows easy use of your Amazon Prime video.  Great movies and series available.  Very easy to use.  I highly recommend this device.  Easy to set up and it works."
"3412","Great unit, I also have a Chromecast I like them both. But for the money I have to give the nod to the Fire Stick. It does somethings the Chromecast can't."
"3413","We just received this on the 20th and we have already went through 4 sets of new batteries.  The remote really drains the batteries. Hopefully this gets improved. Not impressed!"
"3414","Its just ok not bad not good. We already have prime for the shipping option so no extra cost there. There are a lot of tv and moving, some are good some not so good. But the real reason I got the fire stick is so I can look for the TV and movie I wanted to see. And most of them where there BUT you had to pay or down load an app. Now a word about these app, they will say 30day free trial, but what they do not say is when the trial is over they will automatically bill you and they do not say how much."
"3415","I am comparing this item with Roku2 which Inused until a lightning bolt near my home fried both Rocku box and my TV (I know first ever).Pros. Remote is awesome and stick is small and easy to plugin.Cons. Constant connection issues, errors with Apps, disconnect after period of time while on pause and the entire menu while is not that horrible it is clumsy and too many clicks to get to where I want to be or back to my previous watched program.Overall I miss my Roku."
"3416","I love this product. I will order a second one for another room in the house as I can afford the extra money. It is a very mobile item but the TV I have it on is hard to get in and out so it would just be convenient to have another.  This offers an extreme amount of ways to watch movies, listen to music (all the Aps you have on your phone/Ipod; Spotify, Vevo, Pandora, IHeart, You-tube etc) and even watch local channels and some popular cable channels along with HBO. Bye, Bye outrageous cable bills!!"
"3417","easy to use, just plug in follow directions and go. Side note in reviewing the movies the content is usually short. It should be lengthened for the viewer to read. This is due probably to the vendor of movies and the format it's set on, Not an Amazon thing. I have enjoyed the new Fire Stick thus far and its an alternative to cable. You can watch any of your favorite stars, favorite movies, Sports, even your favorite news station.I'm still trying all the other channels that are available."
"3418","This is a great companion for the 55 inch UHDTV I got on Black Friday.  This was a Cyber Monday impulse purchase, and I am glad I did.I don't watch a lot of TV and see no reason to pay for access to hundreds of cable channels that I am not interested in watching.  I think this will be a great alternative with lots of good quality free Amazon shows and movies available when I do want an evening of distraction entertainment, and using the Alexa voice command is kinda fun - and sometimes helpful."
"3419","the remote with this device does not work  like the first generation one. went ahead and ordered older remote with this fire stick. people are wanting the 1st generation fire stick so why doesn't amazon make it available and give the customer the choice. either way you make a sale and customer is satisified. also I would not have ordered fire stick had I known that ship date was in march, to me this info should have been known pryor to making order. to tell the truth it left a bad taste in my mouth."
"3420","This my 2nd fire stick purchase. The first one is in my den and someone is always hogging that TV to watch sports.So, I purchased a 2nd one for the bedrooms- now I have unlimiteda access to Amazon Prime shows and movies. This FIreStick has Alexa and I just love it.  I will probably buy one more for the living room TV.  Another cool feature is to upload your photos to Amazon and you can view them on your TV. Definitely recommend this product. It's much easier to use than another product that I cannot name."
"3421","Great for your move to cut cable.  Load  Kodi and Droid Buddy on it as soon as you can. Go to Yootube on your wireless laptop or tablet and follow instructions on how to load Kodi and Droid Buddy.  If you have 4K and/or do a lot of gaming get Amazon Firebox instead."
"3422","wish it had better pick up with the remote. you have to push the button several times in different angles to get it to pick up. I love the stick however, and I was told about the Kodi app. It is amazing."
"3423","While it works great for Netflix and Amazon movies.  It is absolutely terrible at live streaming ESPN and MLB tv games, the audio is spot in but the video gets choppy.  Since this is my primary source of tv viewing maybe I made a huge mistake the firestick.  Maybe a Roku would have been a better investment.  I just thought it would be nice to not have another set of video/audio cord coming from my tv.  Just fix the live streaming stuff."
"3424","A gift from my husband to make it easy to watch netflix in the bathtub (I know... what a slacker!). But it really is a quality remote that is easy to use."
"3425","i like this,, cheaper than cable with my amazon prime subscription,,think about it,,at $100 a month for cable, vrs just my annual prime cost!!  no brainer"
"3426","Love it.  Couldn't be happier with the to of access I have to programs, apps, shows, etc.  It was really easy to install and I followed YOUTUBE video tutorials to add additional downloads."
"3427","Purchased on sale for the remote only, love this product but disappointed in the quality of the remote, had to replace one that was less than 12 months old"
"3428","Slow.  Hard to navigate.  No 4K.  I would like to be able to make it look like what I want.  Easy to find what I want.  No adds.  Fire does well for Amazon stuff but what do you expect?"
"3429","Bought this for myself. Already had one in the living room but needed for another room in house.Works great, gets more channels then my Apple TV.Amazon makes great products."
"3430","I had total knee replacements and downsized my cable bill to the minimum.  What a delight to have the ability to watch so many TV shows and movies.  Thank you!!!"
"3431","Changed the star rating because my firestick always shuts off out of the blue while im watching something. It's really annoying. Also, why can't I download Prime Video? Other than that I love it."
"3432","Takes a bit to turn on but its great for the tv in my garage the Wi-Fi signal reaches to it so I didn't need to run any cords underground or get a booster"
"3433","Love it!! Hesitant to use this full time vs satellite but got tired of the high prices!  This gives me everything my family needs at a reasonable price!!  TY!!"
"3434","High quality video while watching Amazon Video and Netflix. Love it. Voice recognition is great - much faster than typing on the on-screen keyboard thing."
"3435","The system works well, the menus are well designed and the voice recognition is pretty good.however when u search a title it does not search thru the libraries of netflix or other content providers like youtube that you may also have a subscription for, which kind of defeats the whole concept of buying a new device that was supposed to centralize your viewing options. Universal search aside the system works well. The voice recognition is good, and the availability of viEwing options is satisfactory"
"3436","I simply love the amazon fire TV stick it is the perfect meld of the chromcast and roku tv stick. The device is simple and easy to use. With the android back end there are plenty of apps to choose from and many of your favorite streaming apps are available including the brand new directv go. Alexa is a really cool feature and helps elimate the need to bash in show names using the included remote. I would recommend this for anyone looking to upgrade their smart tv or giving their old tv some smarts."
"3437","I did not feel that it was user friendly.  My husband is the old fashion kind and cannot figure it out.  I am pretty computer savy and it was hard for me to figure it.  Also, it keeps freezing up at random times, which if frustrating when you are interested in the show.  Price is good."
"3438","It seems to work reasonably well, but it gets HOT, hot enough to burn your hand when you touch it.  Someone at Amazon really needs to address that problem."
"3439","I have both Amazon FireTV products (2016 console and stick)---  The stick performs very well (no lag--and faster than my Cox cable remote).  I officially cut the cord---and ordered PS Vue.  I have other devices, Roku (XS, Roku 2 consoles , AppleTV (2nd gen))...these devices are old and didn't work as well with PlayStation Vue service.Alexa is a very nice feature---our family uses Alexa every day.  A must buy at $40 v other options.  Cutting the cord saved us $125/mo after ordering PS Vue..."
"3440","I bought this to watch AMA motocross every week.  It does exactly what I need it to do.  It also has Netflix, Amazon videos, Hulu... but I only use it to watch Live AMA Motocross."
"3441","I've had a 1st generation fire stick for awhile now and wanted to get this for my father for his birthday. I was helping him set up the device and went to calibrate the display scale. I was extremely disappointed to find out that they have removed the scaling feature that the 1st gen had so that the picture would be guaranteed to fit properly and instead you need to adjust scaling on the TV itself. This is a major issue because some slightly older TVs do not have custom scaling options and none of the available scales will correctly fit the calibration image. Therefore, we will have to simply live with part of the screen cut off. This is completely absurd because while our TV may be old is still provides a great 1080p image quality so theres no reason to buy a new TV because amazon has removed the calibration function.I'm still providing a 4 star review because the device is still fantastic and the alexa voice remote is amazing but the removal of this calibration feature is an incredibly inconvenient feature. Additionally, I was planning to update myself to this new model of the fire stick but am no concerned that my dated but still great TV may also have this issue so I may be better off sticking with my 1st generation device unless amazon provides a solution"
"3442","I like the capabilities of this, but I don't like the set up of the buttons.  Perhaps I need to look again at the instructions to see if I'm missing something.But, there's no power on/off button apparently and I feel like it needs more a few more buttons, and that all the buttons should be understandable.  Clearly some are, but I like a remote that helps you navigate better.  I don't need a lot of buttons, but it could be better."
"3443","This is a very good product. I don't have cable tv and my digital antenna doesn't work well to get free tv.  The fire stick provides me with all the viewing I need and some. I like that I can travel with it which I used on my vacation. The price is right this is a must have."
"3444","Love this fire stick. We have cable television, but it provides us with many extras! Easy to set-up and use. Particularly great for Amazon prime users and Disney Lovers!"
"3445","Absolutely love FireTV and Fire TV Stick!! I will never go back to cable or satellite TV. I am no longer paying over $120 a month just for cable or satellite TV. My TV bill is now $45 a month (3 premium channels and SlingTV). TV on my terms/wants, not what the cable/satellite say I can have. I highly recommend Fire TV!! I couldn't be happier with Amazon & Fire!! 🌝"
"3446","I This is my 2nd one. My original one doesn't have voice remote and I used it for my the TV in the bed room so I could get all of the apps. Ii worked great,so when my smart TV quit working, I ordered a second one, a new TV and this stick is cheaper than a smart TV."
"3447","The product itself is good. But what I'm disappointed with is Amazon's false advertising. Outside the USA this product does not allow the viewer access to Prime Videos and TV Shows. I keep getting ""Invalid Geo IP"". This was NOT communicated to buyers. Trinidad was listed as one of the countries the stick can work, however this is not so."
"3448","We love the firestick with Alexa voice Remote really really a good buy it beats paying almost 200 dollars for direct tv... Love love love this and would recommend it to my friends and family.. What a great way to watch and catch up on episodes you have missed with prime are netflix.. Awesome Tv.."
"3449","I am less then satisfied with Fire TV Performance. It is slow on start up. I often have to remove the batteries in the remote and replace them to get the unit to respond. Fire TV Stick is much less reliable then the Apple TV I have on the same TV."
"3450","Amazing little streaming device!...super easy to install, lol and offers so many options...just need to get used to using the circle at top of remote for arrows left, right, up and down. Impressed as usual AMAZON; never disappoint me❣️🎶😊"
"3451","I LOVE it! I have a Chromecast but want the Fire TV Stick for the Beachbody on Demand app so it would be easier to access. However, I don't even really use my Chromecast anymore bc the Fire TV Stick is much easier to use and easier access to all my apps without needing to cast. The only downside is there's no app for VUDU. I can still mirror it but I wish there was an app. I definitely recommend it. I haven't had it long so I'm still getting used to using the Alexa remote but I like it."
"3452","I have never written a review but I felt obligated to do so on this firestick. I am not pleased with it at all. It freezes often, I have to restart the stick daily or at least every other day, I am forced to constantly log into my other accounts because the auto log in feature disables itself and the connection gets lost throughout the day even when my signal is strong. I have yet to watch a movie in its entirety without it freezing or having to load. I would rather go back to paying for cable TV."
"3453","I absolutely love this item! I am so happy with it that I will soon purchase another for my living room television and totally get rid of my cable service at the conclusion of my contract. The only issue I have is the difficulty in understanding how to register for the free movie channels that you purchase. I would certainly like more information on how to do this. Please send information to me via email on how to register for the channels that have been downloaded so I can thoroughly enjoy these."
"3454","This is my first Fire stick and so far I am very pleased. Nice that one can hit the home key in order to activate the stick without having to go through the menu on the TV to select source. I do wish it had a way to revert control back over to the TV so one didn't have to pick up another remote to select the ""source"".  Now that both our Smart TV and our Blu Ray player no longer have access to Amazon ... we had no choice but to buy this. Some other packages are also available via the stick."
"3455","I have to unplug it and plug it back in every time I want to use it. I do not have this issue with the fire tv I have just the firestick. Guess this is what I get for ordering refurbished"
"3456","I like it, but the Alexa feature is a little lacking and can use some updates. Most of the time ""she"" doesn't understand what I'm asking, And it lags from holding the button, to when I can ask something. By that time, I can probably already scroll through to what I want. Other than that, pretty COOL!"
"3457","After selecting all the apps I think I would like it actually came out a lot more expensive then I thought.  Thinking about combining the apps with basic cable."
"3458","This is my second one for my household. The first one was a birthday gift so I decided to purchase another one. This is a great device, very reasonable price, and easy to hook up and navigation."
"3459","I wish I had purchased this much sooner! Super easy to set up. Many more choices than the satellite service I was using at over $100 per month. Options for watching sports so you don't miss a thing."
"3460","I like it, I like it a lot... Easy to set up and amazingly easy to use. Voice feature actually works well. Instead of  endlessly searching through rows of shows on the tv, and different apps (Netflix, Hulu, HBO etc)  I just push the button and say Find ""fill in the blank"", Breaking Bad, Goliath, Play music...  Awesome"
"3461","I cannot get this thing to work properly with the Hulu app. It only works if I unplug it from the wall and the TV for 5 mins. and then plug it back in. I also have difficulty finding the shows I want to watch in the PBS app. The voice command only works on Amazon Prime shows. All the Amazon videos work fine."
"3462","I love this!  the picture quality is better than it is thru my Xfinity cable. I find technically the Fire TV Stick is perfect but the Fire TV interface has a lot to be desired. There are too many steps to add apps.  The UI is clunky but the final result, once you start your show, movie, whatever, is amazing."
"3463","This is an excellent item. It provides access to many sources of media.  The Sirius XM is clear and the quality of presentation & streaming is excellent."
"3464","The ""Stick"" works well but there is a problem with the remotes failing. Hopefully, Amazon will resolve this problem with the newer batch coming out in a few weeks."
"3465","I didn't want to pay for cable every month and found the Fire TV Stick to be a great alternative. I can watch all of my Amazon Prime shows plus much more. Alexa voice remote makes finding something to watch easy. I really like that it has built in bluetooth for my wireless headphones!"
"3466","Love it, my daughter has one and I decided to try. Best deal out there with Amazon prime you can stream great shows and get free shipping, that's the deal !!!!"
"3467","Decent product- although very very laggy. I was surprised actually as I purchased this as a upgrade to the Roku stick.  I purchased primarily for PS Vue as the there is no guide or rich content for it on Roku stick...but the price you pay is too much. Button clicks are 2-4 second delayed and it really becomes frustrating.I also purchased for PLEX, and out of the box this didn't work. I had to fiddle with audio settings in order to get it to work. (It was rebooting the stick prior to this when trying to play a file!)All in all I think this has great potential- but they need to figure out the UI vs performance issues/balance. It's not something the average user would enjoy using at this point."
"3468","This product does what it says on the description.  But I was informed that it would also have a app for Spectrum TV.  But it doesn't.  So if you have Spectrum TV and are looking to see it you might want to get a Roku."
"3469","I like this device but I have since replaced it with the Fire TV because this one does not have an integrated Internet connection, it is WiFi only. I wanted to hard wire to my connection to get the best speed possible."
"3470","Obviously this is a great product. My smart TV had a buffering issue with Amazon Prime and Netflix programs. The fire stick fixed that problem instantly!"
"3471","I love love love my Firestick.I can watch any movie I want thanks to a friend that hooked me up.I am able to watch Live tv as well as The news long as I download the news app of my choice."
"3472","Pretty great way to watch all of your shows. It is fast! I use this over the Chromecast. My problems with it are that Alexa Voice seems to be worthless as it cannot find shows inside of apps like Netflix. If I ask for Sherlock, it can only find episodes for purchase, seems fishy as Sherlock is on Netflix. I have a password set on it for this reason. I do not want my kids accidentally ordering something that I am already paying for. Also, the password takes longer to load than any app."
"3473","Very happy with this purchase.  I already had a firebox and wanted to test out just the stick.  I'm glad I did, because it is just as good and very easy to use.  Great Product!"
"3474","I wanted a device that allowed a remote this device was the answer. I have had chrome cast and roku they only offered cast and are much slower. Firestick is snappy compared to those devices most importantly it offers remote."
"3475","It's working like it's supposed to so far. I haven't used the voice control or many of the features yet. It's pretty plug-n-play, which is exactly what I did. Ironically, it didn't arrive until my free Prime trial was expired. It was on back order for maybe 3 weeks (?). I literally should have just bought it at a box store, but I had a gift card..."
"3476","This is the hardware to use with the amazon fire app and possibly and HDMI six foot extension cord to extend the range outside of your home (i.e. - patio, poolside, etc.). No problems thus far, price was right - similar to apple tv unit in usage."
"3477","AWESOME product....I really love that I can watch YouTube videos from my TV and the menus are easy to use. The only thing I don't care for is the high prices for renting new releases or you have to buy them to watch them as soon as they come out."
"3478","Glad I decided to go this route. I save so much money now and get to watch whatever I like. My only complaint is figuring out how I can watch regular television stations on the device. Can anyone help?"
"3479","Love the fire stick, just had slingbox, kodi and Navi X installed and made the fire TV Stick even better. I use this everyday to watch everything that's on regular tv and all the movies that you can imagine"
"3480","Really enjoying having access to all my streaming services in one place.  I've managed to cut the cord from cable/satellite/Uverse services.  Only thing I miss is live local TV...on NBC.  I can get CBS. Hopefully, ABC and NBC will follow CBS's all access path.  But over all, I cut my monthly TV bill by 2/3."
"3481","Im a little diisapointed with this.  Yes theres channels to watch for free,  bit frustrated others claim free, and once downloaded, ""Slam"" pay!!"
"3482","I love how simple it is to use - no complicated remote with 50 buttons!"
"3483","I have a original non-voice stick (which is ok but time consuming) and this new version of the voice stick is so much better and easier to get to your programming. Just say what you want and it brings it up... no more typing and typing and typing to find your desired programing. I would never buy a non-voice stick again."
"3484","works great. You may find that some of the programs do not come in clearly, you need to scroll through more than one streaming to find one that is clear. I don't see that anywhere in directions, it's really hit or miss.  But it takes a while to figure it all out. You need to be patient and play around with it."
"3485","Misread specs and though it would work with our Echo dot, so was disappointed that the Alexa access is via the Fredrick remote only. And wish that remote wasn't so small and dark (e.g.easy to lose in couch!) but LOVE how easy it is to plug and play. Have only used our Apple tv for airplay now that we have the firestick."
"3486","I own 2 of these. The second stick purchased has stopped functioning properly. First the remote stopped pairing, then it cycles from a show back to the home screen randomly. Spent hours on the phone with Amazon. Factory reset helped for a short time. Remote is garbage though."
"3487","The tv stick works very well-- the remote control could use some help in making it more user-friendly. For those of us who are ""tech-challenged', there is a rather steep learning curve. I think some more basic instructions, written in simple, clear, language is needed. I am irritated to keep having to go to HELP for info I don't think I should have to hunt for! For the device to dump the cable company it is still a great bargain."
"3488","This would be much better if it synced with the amazon ECHO. As of now, it seems that the two technologies are completely independent. Additionally, it is limited once you leave the fire home page. So, for instance, you can use Alexa to launch Netflix, but once Netflix launches you must use the remote to navigate. A small detail, but severely limits the use of the voice controls. It does it's job as a streaming stick. Quality is good and it doesn't seem to have a problem with my internet connection."
"3489","Excellent streaming device if you have some subscription services (ie Netflix, Amazon Prime, HULU). Fast response both in menus and rewind/ff during playback.Went from an old BlueRay player with Netflix and wow what a difference. Wish there were more channels like the CW with free content but even CBS charges you to view their content. Not a fault with the device but just an observation. Love the next up feature for a series you may be watching. For the price its a great system to have!  Love it!"
"3490","Ok, so I should have checked on this before I bought it, but Vudu support is so ubiquitous it didn't occur to me that Amazon's devices wouldn't include it. Seems like a transparent attempt to stick it to Walmart and consumers lose out. I understand there is some way to perhaps get it working using black magic, duct tape and a Dropbox account but I shouldn't have to be bothered with such nonsense."
"3491","Cool little gadget that you insert into an HDMI input on your TV and sync with your WIFI and it brings in clearly Amazon Prime, Netflix and an assortment of other goodies.  I'm very pleased with it :-) ...."
"3492","Works great and easy to navigate. Setup was a snap. Everything that I have streamed on this device runs smoothly. The reason I got this was to run Dish Anywhere app, so that I didn’t need to rent another box from them. That app is working well for streaming live and DVR items. Would highly recommend just for using the Dish App, to save yourself money."
"3493","This is my second fire stick, my older one has seen much more use and works great. This one is only a month old and is hardly used but keeps losing connectivity so I'm always having to reboot it.Edit: 11/13/16 I just received an email from Amazon informing me they were aware of my review, and were replacing my fire stick free of charge. Since I own two Fire sticks, as well as an Echo, and Echo dot and am planning on giving Alexa control of all my smart home devices It's good to know that Amazon has my back."
"3494","th stick workswell enough, using Alexa froze the system up however so I am afraid to use it. Also I found that I can't adjust the volumn while watching. Navigating is hard so I use the Kindle to find a movie then tell it to play on the firestick. Seems like a lot of hoops."
"3495","I really like the use of the remote and the remote works flawlessly. Better than the first one for sure!"
"3496","there's a charge for almost everything you click on.There's only one app I want to download which is kodi  and it wont let me so without that app its not much use for me. The movies they have are low rated trash in my opinion. I will more than likely send it back"
"3497","I love this device! The built in apps in my tv's were loosing support from manufacturers so this allows me to continue to watch Netflix, prime and YouTube again!"
"3498","This is a great product! Now I don't have to hook my laptop up awkwardly to my tv anymore! This makes things so much easier than it was before. I love this and will probably buy it as gifts for people."
"3499","I  actually intended to give the device 5* but with the issue getting into the DARN remote control! It took me nearly 2hours and 1 very frustrating and unproductive call to customer service.Besides that epic Fail, i actually like the Firestick."
"3500","Getting ready to shut the voice off~ her comments are sometimes redundant and flow into movie beginning~ also, I am having loading problems lately and have to go into setting and refresh everything~ never had this problem with my last fire-stick"
"3501","thank you"
"3502","I love it"
"3503","Dear Amazon,The first stick is like no otherIf only I could figure out how to remove the remote coverThen all would be fineApps and pics are divineJust please fix the dang cover you bunch of nutter butters!!"
"3504","I bought this to go alongside a Chromecast and 1st gen Apple TV. So far it has worked much better than other two devices. It's faster and doesn't give me any connection issues, it also doesn't restart itself frequently like the Apple TV."
"3505","Absolutely love this!!!... easy to install and set up,  choices are endless,  and the best part is for this senior citizen is that when you put the movie on pause it shows different screens of different places around the world that absolutely blows me away and sometimes I forget about the movie!!!...lol... that is a fabulous fabulous  extra ... Love my Amazon prime,  Makes me feel special and smart!!!... Great job thank you..."
"3506","I am having a problem with activating my 'stick' even when when the internet settings are excellent. Three times in Network Settings, which showed my  wireless settings as perfect, it indicated that my plugged in Fire TV Stick was not active and did I want to open it? Of course, after some minutes the sign came up as ""cannot open Thomas's  Fire Stick."" Does this mean my Fire Stick is bad or have I done some installing wrong?"
"3507","Just got mine last week.  Whoever designed that remote needs fired.  Had to watch a YouTube video to finally get it open.  Ok after the first time but defied 15 min. of tugging on it before it popped open.  My gs accidentally reset it back to factory and the remote soul not pair up.  Finally I called Amazon, was put on hold for a bit and they hung up lol.  Requested another callback.  Found the fix and the customer svc del and I were both surprised at the simple fix.  Resetting the firestorm unregistered it.  As soon as they registered it, the remote worked.  So far prefer my roku but it's early yet.  Still it's a good product, no fees or cable needed."
"3508","Great product to use with Prime.  Had both Apple TV and Firestick.  Firestick far superior to Apple.  Have disconnected Apple TV because no longer need or use."
"3509","Love the Fire TV Stick.  Fairly easy to install.  Since it's our first time to use this product and we've only had it for a couple of weeks, my review is limited.  We are still trying out the different selections and learning how to maneuver throughout the programming.  So far, everything seems to be going fairly well."
"3510","I am loving this Fire Stick. It is simple to use and has a lot to offer. However, because I am from the Bahamas, I am unable to really take full advantage of what is offered because I am out of the geographical area....Other than that, it is still a good buy. The shows and movies are really clear when I use my Netflix subscription to watch. The remote feels comfortable in your hand and being able to use Alexa makes it much easier to find and type searches.Instillation was also a breeze :)"
"3511","A few tips.  These sticks work best when your router is close.  If you can get the router closer.  Speed and bandwidth  are also important.  Less then 20mbs has been problematic for me.  I also found N routers seem to work better then B or G.  Your millage may differ for sure.  Remember while the sticks are fine they are not as powerful as the Fire TV boxes.  Many of you are using Kodi.  Try and avoid the heavy builds some developers have."
"3512","Overall, it's an awesome product and I'm really happy I got it.  I'm a little bummed it won't play through hdmi and bluetooth at simultaneously.  I also think it's lame they didn't add a software based volume mixer to adjust the sound levels.I'm not very fond of this implementation of Alexis because it's limited in the strangest ways.  Like it won't let you set an timer or delete something off your lists.  I don't understand why it will let me add to the list but not delete from it."
"3513","I have a Roku, Apple TV, and now this! Why have I not gotten one of these before. I do like the voice command to find stuff. Also, when I hit home button, the stick is smart enough to talk to my 5 year old Vizio and automatically switches to the input of the stick. Fast processor, plenty of apps and games. I am still exploring all the channels and games. This combined  with a Roku, oh man, cant get any better. I don't even use my Apple TV anymore. Cant beat it for the price! Highly recommended!"
"3514","It took me a while to decide to get rid of cable but I am happy I did. The fire stick provides me with the ability to still watch my favorite shows but not have to pay so much for cable"
"3515","We purchased this primarily so we could watch Acorn TV on a larger TV screen. This item seems to be programmed as a hook for Amazon Prime. Unless we are mistaken following intuitive steps or by using the microphone to select a particular program takes you to a screen that says Amazon Prime is required. This is not true as we found out by having another user walk us through setup. This seems to be borderline deceptive. Once past this issue the device seems to work properly."
"3516","This is my second Fire TV Stick. Love it. They are great. We take them when we are out of town and want to keep up with the shows we like. Can't be it."
"3517","I really like the firestick its better to have one the to not have one"
"3518","These work great I have one for me and one for my sister. I have high speed internet which is best for any type of similar gadget. If you are on the fence with this just buy it. No need for cable it is the era of cord cutters! You can get Netflix, HBO now ect not to mention you can use you tube to add even more apps for your favorite shows. I will admit some app are tedious to install and require patience (these are the ones for free shows) but it is well worth the price. As an added bonus if you already have Amazon prime it will be preloaded for you. It will even have your card info stored for easy movie rentals. You can add passcode or delete that if you don't like that feature."
"3519","Love it so much I feel like my other TV without it is ""lazy"". Lol! I have my echo connected to this and if I cant find the remote, I just ask Alexa to habdle something for me. Love it!"
"3520","AWESOME!  I never thought I would be able to cut off Verizon FIOS but I did.  Even got rid of the home phone, have a TracFone.  Between the TV and home phone I  will save me $200.00 plus a month.  The TracFone is pay as you go.  I am going home tonight and do the KODI thing.  Thanks"
"3521","I think I have finally found a way to convince my husband to cut the cable cord.  We got a Sling subscription and a $35 over the air antenna. We couldn't be more satisfied."
"3522","They are the best. Gave them away for birthday gifts. Everyone in their families were so happy. They said, ""it's like it is our birthday, too""."
"3523","Love it my firestick(s) came on time and all working. I set them up and programed them with no problem. Really like having Alexa! Definitely would recommend for a friend I did we ordered three lol"
"3524","Works great.  My older 46 inch Samsung LED TV has extra HDMI ports.  The TV now gives me some of the features of a smart TV.  Amazon prime and Netflix work well."
"3525","Every once in a while some sort of bug kicks in where it thinks I no longer have a wifi connection.  Every time this happens the wifi is fine,  all my other devices still work.  This seems to be a constant issue with amazon devices including the tablets"
"3526","Works just like promised. So glad I have Amazon Prime! Also got a subscription to Hulu. Now I can watch all kinds of movies and shows for just a fraction of the cost of satellite or cable."
"3527","Works well. Was offered as a solution to an older unit that had died. Very good service from Amazon. They even have actual people who will call you back on service issues. What a concept😊"
"3528","LOVE IT! We don't have cable and we had our laptop hooked up to our tv as well as speakers. So we would have to boot up the computer every time we wanted to watch something and turn on the speakers separately. AND we would have to use the mouse to do anything. So needless to say we are LOVING having a remote and that all of out apps and shows are right there on the fire stick. Also we love being able to tell Alexa to find our show and she finds it! (: The Fire Stick and Remote have been great for us!"
"3529","Amazing technology! I love the viewing selections and the apps. I now have two for the TVs in my house. I wish there was a way to synch viewing history across devices. All in all the firestick is wonderful"
"3530","I've only had my Firestick for a few days,and love it.There are a bazillion apps I can download and so many programs to choose from now. Alexa was definitely a surprise bonus.And the price was just right. I've recommended the Firestick to several of my family and friends.Certainly the best purchase I've made so far.Amazon,you never disappoint me."
"3531","I have a Amazon Alexa echo dot stand alone device - when I read the advertisement for the New Fire stick it states "" with Alexa Voice Remote"" I was under the impression that it would also control my Echo Dot :-( however I now have 2 separate devices in the living room that use Alexa - I would prefer that the remote controlled the echo dot so when I am not watching TV just listening to music through my stereo I can access Aelxa without having to yell across the room to change track ect....."
"3532","Once configured, it works flawlessly. I had an issue with my WiFi not being able to connect to the device. Did some researching and adjusted the WiFi settings. No problems now."
"3533","Perfect for my office TV that does not have cable but has great wifi connection. I love it. Will also bring to my boat and use it tethered to my cell for movies and news etc..."
"3534","I love it! It's so easy to use and it's opened a whole new world and way of watching television for me! I'm actually thinking of getting ride of cable!"
"3535","Disappointed received this product April 6, 2017 and by May 25th 2017 the remote has already quit working and of course the warranty is up.  I had an older Fire Stick which we loved  and wrongly assumed the quality would have been just as good.  I don't see me buying another one at this point."
"3536","Works great!  Got rid of expensive cable bill & with the addition of Hula & Amazon prime I have a way better choice of what to watch than what I had with cable."
"3537","came quickly,nice productHappy with it. Had couple of questions, buyer responded. still learning slowly.sharp images on tv! Good deal!"
"3538","This is my third fire tv stick. Overall, the product works well and I enjoy the quality of the streaming. I changed my first one (older version) because it was giving me problems with the Sling TV app. However, this issue continued with the newer Alexa version. So I assume the problem is on Sling's side (for this, I've discontinued my Sling TV subscription since). Also, the remote control for the fire tv was defective - draining the batteries every 7-10 days. Amazon is replacing it at no cost."
"3539","I have only had it a few days, and have not had much of a chance to use it so far.  However, it doesseem to be fantastic!  I got it up and running, very quickly, with no problems.  My Internet connectionspeed may be an issue with streaming movies, but I will check that out.  In any event, no problemsviewing TV shows.  It does seem to be amazing technology and I eventually hope to ditch my cableTV and use only the Fire Stick.  I absolutely would recommend this to anyone."
"3540","With the rising cost of cable and satellite services and the need tighten up my budget, I purchased the Fire TV stick to test the ""waters"". I absolutely love this device. I can watch TV, TV shows, movies, Netflix, and more at a fraction of the cost!!!!! Amazing device. If you want to save money, the Amazon Fire TV stick is the item to purchase. Did I forget to mention the amazing Alexa voice remote.....Fantastic!!!!! If you're a prime member, even better....Omg, best purchase ever :-)."
"3541","This was easier to set up than my Fire TV and I love it like I do my Fire TV. Watching movies, tv shows, etc.. has been fantastic.It's cheaper than going to the movies plus you get to watch and relax in your home. You can't go wrong with this Fire TV Stick as it's only a small investment and you are going to get years of enjoyment."
"3542","wonderful to not have to watch commercials every 15 minutes.  Not super user friendly since there isn't an explanation of how best use it but experimentation works ok.  Not as many acclaimed movies as I had hoped but plenty of content to watch."
"3543","So far so good. We use it for streaming shows & movies. No issues with buffer and video quality is great. Already had a Prime membership so plenty of things to watch."
"3544","I am not tech savvy, but am learning how to use it fairly easily. Can watch shows and movies i didn't realize were still on the air.  Only thing that would help would be a written quide on the shows and movies."
"3545","If you don't have a smart TV or internet enabled device already connected to your TV - then get this ASAP! So many great things you can do with it. I find myself using it every day. Couldn't be happier with it!"
"3546","I had multiple issues with my ROKU remote so I figured I would try the Amazon Fire stick.  It works great...no issues at all and voice is a great side benefit."
"3547","Great tech. Ready to set up. Check out the things you can do with your Fire Stick on U-Tube. Bring it on vacation but make sure you can change the source on the TV. Borgota Hotel in AC will not let you use their TV with your Fire Stick."
"3548","You'll get much better performance out of the remote if your hdmi ports are on the side of the tv. If in the middle back it takes some adjustment or otherwise your remote range can be impacted. ETA: I installed the hdmi extender and it's now working great, from even 25 plus ft away. Before I was only getting good performance from five ft away. Even though I had room to plug in directly to the port, adding the length allowed me to reposition for optimal performance. Very pleased with this device."
"3549","One star gone for no Vudu and no volume control options from fire stick! Please add it in the next update!!!! Otherwise its super fast and awesome device."
"3550","WOW I am so impressed with this.  Saves me tons of money.  So easy to use and so small and very adequate for what we needed.  I highly recommend this."
"3551","I've cut the cord since ordering the Fire Stick. I now use DirectTV Now and my Prime membership, and my ""cable bill"" has been slashed in half."
"3552","I bought this about 1 month after I purchased an X Box One and it is amazing!  Great for streaming media and my kids love the games that are included."
"3553","We are able to get close to cable cutting with the exception of local channels. The movies and programs are free if you download the right files.We are using two firesticks and have no conflicts with Comcast cable internet using our own modem and router. The firestick starts up easily.We are fortunate to get 89+mbs on the 5 gig tier. so streaming loads fast and no lagging ever.The firestick would be a perfect fit for someone who has internet service and does not have cable tv!"
"3554","Seems to be a bit of remote lag that angers me. Great for committing to a movie and leaving it alone, but if your're a channel surfer you may get  disappointed by the speed."
"3555","I got this as a Christmas gift and it took me 5 months to get someone to help get it set up for me.  I have really enjoyed the gift for about 3 weeks."
"3556","I have the older stick and got the newer version with remote works great a few times it froze but still like it and telling Alexa what I want to watch"
"3557","This is my 2nd for stick and i love them.  I watch a couple of the original series olus use it to access netflix from non-cabled tv's.  Highly recommend!"
"3558","You have to play around with this a lot to find exactly what you are looking for, but once that is done you are golden. Just make sure you have the right internet speed. All I can say is bye bye cable!! This is one of the best investments that I have ever made, and I am mad at myself for not doing this sooner."
"3559","Amazon Fire Stick has changed my life. I didn't use to watch that much TV and now I worry it might become a problem. Worth it. I've found I never use the Alexa feature with it though. I have an echo and use that."
"3560","We have poor reception at our house for local TV, and hate the price of cable. So when hubby bought me a new TV for my bedroom, I was so unhappy because we couldn't get anything on it! Heard about the Fire TV Stick, and decided to give it a try! Am I glad we did! I now have access to Amazon Prime, Netflix and even more channels through the FIre TV Stick. Reception, clarity, all of it is great! Very happy with my investment! Still getting used to Alexa though...it's my southern accent I think!"
"3561","Had it 5 days.  Took a long time to initially connect to a good router 6-7 feet away in the same room.  It kept asking for the password, which finally worked after I entered it several times.  Worked great for 2 days.  It now simply freezes on the home screen after the TV is turned on.  Have to turn the TV off and on 3-4 times before the Firestick is usable.  Removing and reinstalling the brand new batteries sometimes helps.  I really expected a better product from Amazon and may return this."
"3562","I recently joined a streaming TV provider. My subscription included a ""box"" from one of your higher priced competitors. For my 2nd TV set I bought the Fire TV stick. I had assumed that the Fire would work better with my Amazon Prime video, which it did. But much to my surprise It seems to work better in general - less dropped programs, less buffering, less ""freezing"".more intuitive operation of the controls. So far I'm very pleased with it. But how do I shut of the controller?"
"3563","It works great, even with my slow speed internet. I plan on upgrading my Internet and buying these for all my TVs and eliminate cable. Very easy to set up."
"3564","The fire tv stick is a great alternative to cable and satellite tv.  The battery cover was difficult to remove but a you tube video helped with this problem.  Very happy with it."
"3565","A BIT COMPLICATED ON THE SEARCH.TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO"
"3566","Exceptional portable device.  Received the Fire TV stick for FREE by signing up with Directv Now.  Took the Fire TV stick with me to a relatives house who does not have cable and we were able to watch 60 channels of Directv Now and HBO via streaming off of my Iphone with the At&t unlimited plus mobile plan.  I prefer the Fire TV stick over the Roku Express but I have not tried any other Roku products.  I will definitely take the Fire TV stick with me every time I travel."
"3567","Both of our Fire TV Sticks seem to need at least a daily reboot, otherwise it only shows a black screen when we turn to them as a source of programming."
"3568","What can I say about the Fire Stick, I love it!! I don't know why I waited so long to get one.  Amazon products are really the best things out there.  I feel like a kid in a candy store every time I use it.  I'm working on cutting the cord and just using the Fire Stick as our primary source of entertainment at home.  Easy set up, easy remote, very easy access to finding the right apps for you.  Even my husband who is not tech savvy loves it."
"3569","Love it. We have Netflix and Amazon Prime so all of our movies are right there. I also enjoy the Beachbody exercise videos so I got the app and access to all of their videos whic is also on my Fire TV Stick. I also have my Pandora Music on there as well as my amazon Music. Absolutely love it."
"3570","I really like this better than the google chrome I had before.  The Firestick was easy to plug and play.  I was able to set a parental control and take it off easily.  Netflix, HBO go, and YouTube (what I use the most) loads efficiently."
"3571","I like it so far. i'm learning how to use it  as I go. set up was fairly easy. what I didn't like is the HDMI extender doesn't work, I tried a few times to connect to my tv using it."
"3572","It is a really nice device but it needs a power button. How do I turn it off. I have been unplugging it to power it down. You need to send better instructions with the device."
"3573","I have been without tv in my bedroom for a while, until I was told about Amazon Fire stick. I watch my tv now and love my fire stick, it takes the place of cable that i could not afford. I would recommend this to anyone ."
"3574","Works great when your internet is working, not the firestick's problem! Very easy setup and great selection of shows. Have not used Alexa yet, though."
"3575","I love Fire TV Stick. Though there are many apps that are not compatible with stick, but only with Fire TV, I will like to upgrade to Fire-TV instead."
"3576","I love the Fire Stick! Inexpensive and so easy to install and use. I have an Apple TV but ever since receiving the Fire Stick I hardly, if ever use it!"
"3577","We have several generations of Fire TV Sticks and this one feels like an upgrade from the previous. The Alexa button and system works well enough, as far as we've tested it. I haven't installed Kodi or SPMC (personal favorite fork) on this latest generation, but from what I've read, there shouldn't be any problem."
"3578","Our family really likes the fire stick.  My husband likes that you can stream YouTube in the TV and watch MLBtv."
"3579","This is really awesome.We bought it for our smart tv cause we need more apps on it.It also works well on our regular tv.  We're planning on buying more.I would highly recommend this purchase."
"3580","my only complaint is that the shows shut off after a while. i like to sleep with the tv on and i wish that the shows and movies stayed on all night. i hate waking up and there is no tv on....."
"3581","It does okay.  It's slow to move back and forth between channels.  The Alexa voice remote is useless - works less than half the time.  Aside from that, it's okay."
"3582","The fire stick was a big giant hit in our family this Christmas!  I gave one son in law a fire stick and my husband wanted one, so I ordered him one and gave it to him before Christmas.  (Instant couch potato).  At Christmas my other son in law wants one!  Birthday present!  This is the best!  I love it."
"3583","Ok people Amazon emailed me and asked me to contact them. Amazon your awesome Amazon customers beware their are fakes out there asking for an activation fee. I was rerouted to India idk how. Any way I recieve an email from an Amazon rep who added a link that got me directly to Amazon thank god. The person who helped me was great got the firestick working in 2 minutes. I'm very happy thanks guys."
"3584","This is my second fire TV stick. This new version is better because you can set a VPN. As small contained video platforms go I have enjoyed it greatly."
"3585","Great alternative to cable and satellite. We ditched ours months ago. A little tricky to use at first. Easy to operate after getting used to it though."
"3586","For speed, I'd give it 5 stars but can't do that because Amazon has the prepriority thing locked down so tight I'm unable to add any channels I want unlike my old ROKU it replaced."
"3587","Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player Works exactly as described. Easy to connect and easy to use. Had it up and running in 5 minutes."
"3588","I got the fire stick for watching the super bowl. I haven't had any issues with it and think it's a great product. It's easy to use and the voice function works perfectly. I would say get this especially if you have a prime account. You get the most out of the fire stick with a prime account. Great product and good price."
"3589","Great little deal...came ontime, does what it's supposed to...mucho cheaper than paying the cable Co. for a load of channels we could care less about."
"3590","Very COOL. Watched a few movies, using it in the Cave/Office. Main TV had a DVD player with Netflix but no Amazon Prime which I recently signed up for, go Samsung. Still playing with the Stick but initially very COOL. Can't get Alexa to type for me."
"3591","So awesome! Before buying this I had a Roku and a Chrome! And with those other 2 I feel like I have to constantly use other devices along with it. With this, everything is perfect! If you've been on the fence about buying one of this, you should just take the plunge and buy it. I bought mine at an Amazon kiosk and they assured me if I have any problems or I'm not happy with the product they would give me a refund , I didn't have to return it, I love everything about it and I use it everyday!"
"3592","I can't believe the level of technology that 40 bucks buys today.  This thing installed super simple and worked great right out of the box.  Set-up was a couple of clicks and really easy.  I normally don't like installing new things and they are usually a pain in the neck...not so this fire stick.  I love the voice feature and music search which is super easy.  We use it now for music, movies, tv shows and youtube video.  Maybe later we may try other apps but for now this is an entertainment overload."
"3593","No instructions except to 'plug it in' it was very involved to set up, in fact we had a technician walk us through the process.We did however install 'kodi' so my husband can get 'live' sports games. After playing around with it ""a lot"" he has managed to navigate his way around & we have watched one movie on it. Quality is ok & you have to find the right 'feed' in order to get a clear picture. It does save $100's of dollars a month though as cable bills are outrageous both here & back home in Canada."
"3594","This device is awsome i own the chromecast as well and use this instead now also does casting from your phone thanks amazon for another great product!"
"3595","My Samsung Smart TV decided not to be smart any more so a technician suggested I try a Fire TV Stick - easy setup and easy to use - have been very happy with it thus far."
"3596","Good to watch what I want, when I want and, for the most part, commercial free.  Nice to have an add'l $150 a month in my pocket by cutting cable TV."
"3597","Awesome! But I wish I would have invested in the more expensive one because this one doesn't have movie releases, but it's still amazing!! I LOVE it!"
"3598","Much smarter than my smart vizio."
"3599","I am still learning my way around this but so far it works well.  I had an issue with the remote but outstanding customer service solved that for me.This is a great alternative to cable and has so much more content that I actually WANT to watch!"
"3600","The fire stick has its perks, however I did not think most every site costs money monthly as well. If I were to subscribe to every site I wanted or liked it would cost more than the monthly cable bill I already have. So not very cost effective at all."
"3601","This is my second fire stick with Alexa, I actually ordered it through Alexa voice control....so easy! I love this it’s  so easy to set up and use. I highly recommend this."
"3602","Still working on the learning curve after switching from satellite tv. Amazon shows are great and love that we have Hulu and Netflix all in one application."
"3603","Wonderful image and easy to use but the fact that there is no Vudu app is extremely disappointing and the reason why I give this 3 stars. My entire digital library other than the Disney anywhere videos are on Vudu so right now my new projector is limited on movie night."
"3604","I love my Amazon fire stick. It is worth the low price I paid for it.I watch my favorite shows and it automatically brings it up. Very pleased."
"3605","I bought this for my grandparents so they don't have to pay for cable anymore. They love it! They can ask Alexa to do nearly everything for them, and they don't have to fiddle around with 10 remotes. My grandparents are not technology inclined, but this was so easy to use it didn't matter. I did have to set it up for them though."
"3606","Works great and was very easy to install and setup. Except for taking the Plasma TV off of the wall to locate the HDMI, that sucked. Other than that it went as smooth as a babies bottom."
"3607","Love the stick, except power cord should be longer!!. Also have a Fire box. Like the Amazon interface screens, and nice crisp resolution, slightly better than another box we have. Love voice remote."
"3608","After reading hundreds of reviews I thought I could do away with buying an extra box from Xfinity Cable (Comcast).  No this does NOT work with Xfinity as of 12/2016.  Why do people buy this unless you use Hulu or another streaming service?  I bought this for my basement hoping to eliminate a second cable box that I won't use that often.  Unfortunately, Xfinity app is not available to download so despite all the reviews you read or Google on how to...don't bother!  It does not work with Comcast."
"3609","GAME CHANGER. I can't believe people are still paying over $200 for Apple TV!!! We have access to my parents Slingbox and cable, so we just downloaded all the apps, logged in, and BOOM. High quality HD sports, TV, movies. No more rigging our computer to the TV with an HDMI cable. No more cords. We could not be happier!!!"
"3610","LOVE IT !! TONS of TV programs, especially enjoy Amazon's Original Programming.  Who needs Comcast and their Inflated prices??Great investment."
"3611","Easy way to access and watch Amazon, Netflix, etc. content without having to connect your computer.  I was under the impression the device would be powered by the TV/HDMI connection but it turns out another wire connects to the fob which you need to plug into an electrical outlet.  I understand you can also buy another cable to plug into a USB port of the TV."
"3612","I'm in awe of the fire TV Stick!  The images are great!  It's interface is easy to navigate.  I've experienced no buffering while viewing a program and connecting to my WiFi is a breeze!  However,  I do have one complaint: My first remote control stop scrolling left,  so I had to exchange it.  But the cool Fire Stick App turned my phone into a remote control."
"3613","I love Amazon!!! This Fire stick Does everything it's supposed to do and more! Amazon is the best thing to happen to consumers in decades. Thank you!"
"3614","Its good I just didn't know that you could not watch absolutely nothing without a subscription. I cant watch it now because the dog chewed up my cord but I love it. I only had it for six months and it went out  not working at all."
"3615","Pleasantly surprised. I have had ROKU devices before so I was a bit hesitant to buy another ""stick"" for the TV but didn't want to foot the bill for a new smart TV.  This device is easy to navigate and provides a lot of viewing options. The only reason it is not five stars is that there are a lot of apps available but you cannot determine if you will be able to utilize the service until you download the app so there is lot of wasted time downloading apps that you may not able to use."
"3616","Very Good"
"3617","My new fire stick seriously lags, even more than the one I bought last Christmas. Many apps will open to their home/loading screen, but no further. I can't even get to a log in screen for many of them. About half the time I try to use the voice remote, Alexa says ""Sorry, I'm having some trouble. Please try again later."" This is supposed to be an upgrade to the old stick and the old one works much better. I'm going to contact Amazon to see about a replacement. It's basically useless."
"3618","This device got me off cable saving me close to a hundred dollars a month. Allows me to stream 3 nteworks that gives me all I need.  Simple to set up and work with."
"3619","If it wasn't for my children booking it up and explaining that yes, I really did need three remotes I wouldn't have been able to use this. I really like being able to see tv on my own time. I can now go beyeeen regular tv and fire. My youngest labelled the remote with taped down sticky notes. It's good!"
"3620","This is for people who have unlimited internet. It would be nice to have it disconnect once in awhile because it never turns off and uses a lot of data.So I gave it 4 stars for this. Again, it's great for someone who doesn't have cable or satelite like myself but that has unlimited internet usage."
"3621","I love what this device brings to the table and it's abilities"
"3622","Works great. Exactly as expected. I also have an Alexa Dot but I use this for Alexa more frequently.Great for all viewing needs - Netflix, Hulu, Kodi, etc."
"3623","I like it, perfect for what I need and my main reason for getting it is because I previously had a Google Chromecast and there was a major app I wanted to use that didn't work with Chromecast. I only have two major drawbacks. I wish the remote maybe came with a keyboard extension or something to search easier and Alexa doesn't work well so far I'm noticing in certain apps. For example, I use the Kodi app and if I want to search something in Kodi using the voice remote, it doesn't search in the Kodi app."
"3624","Very pleased with this but I do wish voice search in YouTube worked with the remote. But at least I can use my phone's  voice search and cast to it."
"3625","So far so good , I never used the Alexa voice yet .i want to be abke to use te prime app on TV and is great also You Tube and another several apps ."
"3626","I seriously love this thing! I don't have a smart tv so I love having access to my Amazon shows and movies without having to watch them on my phone!"
"3627","This is a great gadget, was easy to set up and now I'm cable free.  Works perfect with Sling TV.  Very pleased with this purchase.  Love Alexia too."
"3628","Idk why I thought this had USB connection oh well it works good I haven't fully tried all it has to offer at least I don't think so I may have I really want Kodi on it"
"3629","The addition of Alexa To the Firestick makes it easy to find and display my requests. It makes the whole experience enjoyable and efficient.  Now I can easily find the movies and music I'm looking for, and I can look at my photos and use various apps"
"3630","I absolutely LOVE this gadget.  My whole family can now watch prime movies together without cords or tying up my kindle.  What a freeing experience!"
"3631","I bought 2 fire tv stick for my mom and I in December 2016 and the remote keep acting up, one was replaced but it was refurbished and I was charged the full price for that because I did not return the old one, mind you the customer service rep said nothing about returning the old one. Smh, the remotes is forever not working. you would think it's the battery but it's not cus the batteries work in other remotes."
"3632","I just installed it today, so time will tell, but so far, it's very easy to install and set up.  I did a few trial things and it's also easy to use and is working great for us so far...love it!"
"3633","Froze up a bit during set up but is way cheaper than ordering tv service easy to navigate only pet peeve is the size of thr remote gets lost so easy"
"3634","There is no ""off"" button.  So you either have to jerk it out of your tv everytime- or let it run, and use your electricity for an extra 30 minutes each time you use it. Probably done this way so the company has CONSTANT access to ""update"" and add s*** you didn't ask for and didn't give permission to add."
"3635","its nice but it takes our children to show us how to use it. And set it up. we are are sick of high cable bills from Comporium so we bought one for each tv"
"3636","My family decided to cut the cable cord. We were skeptical of streaming and did not know anything about it. After researching and talking to friends we decided to go with Amazon Fire stick. It's now installed on our four televisions and working great! We are believers!"
"3637","Love it!"
"3638","Don't like the fact that there's a charge for all in good movies"
"3639","The Alexa part of this works perfectly just like my Amazon Echo.  The TV voice control only really seemed to work well with prime content and not so well with other service providers like Sling.  You can launch the an app by saying ""launch Sling"" but you can't say something like ""watch CNN"".I like how you can load this up with Apps and then take it with you when traveling, etc. I used this device and a Sling TV subscription to cut the cord and couldn't be happier."
"3640","I have 2 fire TV's, this is my first fire stick, and I must say, it is great, easy to set up and use, I may purchase another one for my son's kid cave"
"3641","Works well, it has all my television shows and movies in one place."
"3642","Worth the investment and great shipping time.  This is our 2nd one!"
"3643","Had it only for a few weeks, but loving it already! Have lots to learn about what all it can do, especially if you add Kodi and other apps to enhance your device."
"3644","I love this product and all but this god damn controlle is unresponsive half the time or even maybe more than that . At first I thought the batteries are the reason but after changing them and put the new batteries in it's still unresponsive most of the time ."
"3645","Got it during the wknd sale! It's awesome. I finally got the stick and looking into getting the box. I've been missing out. It's a lot less laggy then the first gen."
"3646","Nice addition to Over the air TV.  We use DSL (no cable available) and we get a few buffering pauses at the beginning of a program. This seems to stop after fifteen minutes and is no more worrisome than commercials.  I have a Prime account and there many ""free"" programs included.  However you need to look carefully at the gold box.  The text telling that there is a charge is small and easily missed.  The good thing is that I have a Netflix account that also works on the Fire stick."
"3647","I have been using the fires tv tick for 4 months now. The fire tv stick give me lots of things to watch if you know how to install addition apps to it."
"3648","its ok...works as expected...just got it so I don't have a lot of experience with it. When the kids are home and I want to try to watch something via the stick it can get very laggy and I do not want to increase my internet expense by increasing my Mbps so i seem to use it when the kids are not around."
"3649","I had the previous edition of the FireStick. And loved it so much I got one for all the rooms of my house for my family members. However, none of us use the voice feature. We just dont need it. I love the quick set up (less than 5 minutes), how all the apps are kept in different sections, like what I have, whats popular, etc. It makes it easy to find things."
"3650","I have multiple fire sticks and have purchased a couple more for family. The best decision ever. No more cable and my entire family streams our shows."
"3651","Alexa voice remote makes using this Fire TV  stick very easy to use. No more manually hunting around for the proper path to find a show or category of shows, just speak into the remote and Alexa does the work for you...and in much less time!"
"3652","works great,  the remote is responsive. only issue I have is installing batteries, the battery door is built like fort knox, if you dont believe me youtube it"
"3653","Absolutely love the fire stick! Would give 5 stars. If Vudu was on it or if at least said it wasn't. Way better than the Roku box I have. Either way. Very nice"
"3654","This has Changed the way we watch TV, period.  Though streaming video still has few bumps, like connecting to a show takes a little time sorting through the menus."
"3655","I have the first version of the fire stick. Got this one to try out the remote the voice command works well. The stick has a good amount of memory for what I need."
"3656","Was easy to set up and took no time at all. Although I have some issue with it loading some times. I also have a fire tv but haven't had any issues with it at all."
"3657","This is my preferred streaming device. It has an excellent user interface and an app for my favorite service, TCM, which isn't available on other devices. I bought a Fire TV a few years ago and picked up the Stick recently. It has the same functionality as the Fire TV, even with lower technical specs, at a much lower price. It's a great addition for a multiple TV household."
"3658","Streams all my apps seamlessly. I would say this beats my Apple TV as far as connectivity. Easy to plug in and take on the go with you. Also used this in my hotel room with no issues using the ""slow stream/free"" internet selection. Highly recommend."
"3659","This was one of the best gifts I've ever received.  I have already recommended it to several people.  The ease it in which it was installed was great"
"3660","Decent player with good picture and fast response.  It didn't stream from Amazon Prime purchases as I had hoped and only offered what they had listed.  The only way to stream from an Amazon Prime purchase is from an Android phone or Amazon Fire tablet.  I'll stick with my Apple TV's since both of them have no internet browser that is necessary to connect through a hotel Terms & Agreement page.  Only way to get past that is by calling the internet provider and giving them your MAC Address."
"3661","I simply enjoy using the Amazon Fire Stick.  It consolidates access to Netflix, HULU and other application with ease.  I was tired of watching my wife use my PS3 to connect to Netflix when this is so much easier to just use the fire stick.  Also, I like the fact that it is portable and can be taken when we travel.  The only thing you need is a great internet connection and you're golden.  I purchased others for our home just to ensure we have the same access in every room.  Thanks Amazon!"
"3662","Been wanting to get rid of cable for a long time and this is the best solution out there. Easy to set up, Alexa voice commands make it simple to get your program and HULU is wonderful. So many programs to watch and the shows that are not on any TV programming are wonderful. Its a fresh variety of programming but best of all I am saving $60.00 a month just having internet with WIFI. Love it!"
"3663","Eh. I'm disappointed. Hard to find things. Have to work Netflix thru my laptop. Graphix take up too much space. Need a text list version or option."
"3664","We first saw these products when we vivited her. It was exactly what we have been looking forWe have had them for a month and we are very happy with them."
"3665","I had the older version of the Fire TV stick and loved it, this one is even better.  I had a problem with buffering and my internet connect but, it was NOTHING to do with the device, it was my outdated router and as soon as I replaced that the streaming is tremendous."
"3666","Best thing I ever did was to buy the fire stick and cut the cable!!We have amazon prime so there is so much to watch.So affordable also ,we bought 2 of them ."
"3667","This thing is totally worth the price tag!  It connects easily and set up and install was a breeze!  My 7 year old can navigate this thing no problem!  I wish I could give it a 4.5 stars! My issue and I see that it is common amongst YouTube tutorials is that the remote may los connectivity with the fire-stick!  To remedy this issue, I just downloaded the remote app and used my cell phone to control the fire-stick! But overall, I love it!  Just purchased a second one!"
"3668","Loving them so far!!! Amazing performance comparing them to nexus player and even some s905x android box.The best remote of all android boxes i have tested no lag waking up from sleep. I tried sheild tv before this for $199 price tag worst laggy remote"
"3669","I absolutely love the Fire Stick it not only made my T.V. bill go way down from overcharging satellite companies But it gives me so many choices to watch and 90% is free . My son enjoys connecting his tablet to watch his movies . I have had very few issues with this device and Amazon has always been right there to help with any issues if they arise . I recommend this to anyone with unlimited internet access."
"3670","Like the voice aspect. Shows twnd to stutter while streaming even though we have top internet speed etc. Would be better if it ran echo dot too, too many remotes"
"3671","Purchased this in March and traveled Europe with it.  Made it easy to watch some amazon shows and Netflix.  However, yesterday the remote randomly stopped working when I was watching Netflix.  I did all the troubleshooting that amazon recommends plus looked/followed some YouTube advice and nothing worked.  There's only a 90 day warranty so I have purchase a new remote.  Good news is that you can download a amazon remote app to use your firestick."
"3672","Easy to set up, turned my t.v into an amazing streaming device and has everything I need for my entertainment experience. The Alexa voice capabilities make surfing as easy as whispering a couple words!"
"3673","Super easy to setup and use. Lots of features to choose from and it works great with my prime account. I need another one and I might spring for the the Fire TV so that my kids can play some games too."
"3674","Easy to use, when ordered with Prime,it comes already set up and logged into Amazon Prime video.  The Alexa feature is a great thing. Other apps are easy to set up as well."
"3675","This comes in a small colorful box, and when opened it is sheer joy! So simple and cool!! Seriously...buy it...you won't be disappointed. Every morning I ask Alexa for the weather and then let the music play.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!! I come home and she tells me a briefing of the Evening news, forecast, and suggestion for movies.  Every app you could want pop ups too. You will never say to yourself ""this is a waste of money.""  It is more like, ""Can't wait to show my friends!"""
"3676","I have gotten rid of my cable services and using my firestick as our family entertainment. It has something for everybody from my 7yr old to me 34yr old mother of 4."
"3677","Easy to install,but hard to navigate on screen."
"3678","What a great bit of technology to compete with these ridiculous cable/satellite prices.  Just hope its the way of the future and the government doesn't jump in for big business and try to regulate this too!"
"3679","Easy to install and anyone can unberstans the simple instructions  Even us that are non techiesThe voice command works well and we like the choices for the appsThis is our second unit for downstairs we liked it so much for the  first genWe plugged it into to hdmi port on our stereo receiver input and it works fineI did return extender because screen said not enough power.We have an older plasma tv so this gives us updated internet accessNice job Amazon"
"3680","I am so very pleased with this purchase I wish I would have made the decision long ago.This has convinced me to divorce cable forever it's, too overpriced.Plus I love the fact and opportunity I have control over what I want to watch. There's entertainment for every age.I would strongly recommend this product for anyone that loves being in control of what they watch and want to save lots of money and the headache of dealing with the robbery of the cable companies. Go for it,it's worth it!"
"3681","The Firestick works perfectly for what we wanted. We replaced Cable and saved a lot of money, except for the fact that our internet was raised to make-up for it. Reguardless, it will pay for its self in a matter of three months. Best decision we've ever made with entertainment."
"3682","Not at all impressed with it. Everything must be programmed and that is very time consuming. And then you have to program the same thing over, and somethings you cannot even get something you really wanted. I personally feel it was a waste of money. Needs a lot of improvements."
"3683","This product is awesome. It operates way better than my smart tv or my Xbox to manage apps like Netflix, Hulu, DTV Now, etc. I had a chrome cast but it wouldn't stream my Amazon stuff so that is also a plus. The voice use on the remote is spot on. Works really well. Setting up the device was also extremely easy.Only complaint I have is that the buttons on the remote can be a bit misleading. Other than that I would recommend this to anyone. Great product."
"3684","Functions smoothly. Lot of program options. Better than my Roku.  The Netflix app is better on  fire stick. Didn't know they required separate power, I thought the HDMI supplied the power. Not a big deal, but others might want to know​ this. I've played around with Alexa voice but it's not something I would use though it does work. I like the look of the layout of the programs on the screen. Well worth $40."
"3685","I found the airtv that you can get for 50 dollars if you sign up for sling to be much easier to use. It allows you to integrate your OTA channels in the same guide as the sling. Adany app you can download from Google play, it will dowliad and run. Well worth the extra ten bucks if you are cutting the cord. It also has Voice​ recognition. Te firestick is nice because you can take it with you when you travel."
"3686","I have had the Amazon Fire Stick for less than four months. I enjoy the programs available; however, I do not like the prospect of purchasing a replacement Fire Stick every three to four months. My Fire Stick is dead in the water and now I must purchase another one. I have had Apple TV for several years and it has worked beautifully. I am very disappointed with the Fire Stick. I expected better from Amazon."
"3687","I would like the Fire TV Stick better if it came with a user manual.  I have had problems taking advantage of the Prime movies I find on my Kindle and choose to watch the movie on our TV so both my husband and I can view the movie together.  Two days ago when I attempted to watch a movie on the TV from my Kindle, the Fire TV Stick screen froze.  I had to re-boot the stick twice before it would even work.  A manual could have helped me avoid a problem if I knew what I may have been doing wrong."
"3688","Works well and was very easy to install. I love the fact that I can play my music and open quick with Alexa voice as well as shopping, only thing is Alexa remote does not adjust tv volume in my TV. It is definitely better than ROKU in my experience after owning both."
"3689","I'm really enjoying the fire stick the amount of television and movie selections is very good. Installed extremely easily and works like a champion."
"3690","This is awesome. Now I can just sit in my bead and talk to the t.v..  The t.v. listens and does exactly what I want it to do.  Perfect relationship."
"3691","Not sure what the RAM specs are but the new Fire TV Stick doesn't seem to be noticeably faster than my old Fire TV Stick though. Maybe the next generation Stick will have more memory and at least 2 GB of RAM?I do love that this new one comes with the voice control Alexa standard and that it was only $29.99. I wish that I had bought another one to replace the other ""old"" one hooked up to our bedroom TV. That will have to wait until the next time that it goes on sale again."
"3692","Very easy to set up (already knows I'm me).  Works great.  I think I like the voice control thing, too.  A lot of bang for the buck!  I guess I can retire my Roku..."
"3693","Love it. Works great. Just wish the HBO GO app worked on it. Not very good instructions of how to use it. I have no streaming or buffering issues."
"3694","Love it.... I had another device similar to this one, through a very popular search engine brand name. Honestly, I would buy this device again.The remote makes things much easier."
"3695","My son bought this for me for my birthday.  It was quick to set up and very easy to navigate through all the great options and channels.  I was hesitant to purchase as it I thought it would be difficult to operate.  The voice command is very helpful and easy to find movies and long lost episodes of favorite shows.  I would recommend this product for all ages."
"3696","This works well.  Instructions would have been a huge help in locating channels and saving favorites as well as knowing what is free and what willl cost."
"3697","My favorite device for watching movies. Easily connects to your Amazon video account. Tons of extra apps for playing games or watching more movies."
"3698","I was tired of being overcharged by Verizon so I decided to try the Amazon Fire Stick with voice.  It takes some getting used to.  With Verizon, everything is at your fingertips.  With the stick, you have to do some work and there are no local channels with it.  I had to purchase a stand alone antenna to get local channels."
"3699","It you have amazon prime get this product.  Great selection of movies and series to watch.  Everything uploads quickly.  Also aids with Nexflick, Sling, Hulu, etc."
"3700","Excellent device, very, very little buffering compared to Roku Ultra, easy to use & GUI intuitive and easy to use, controls straightforward and easy to use, setup was a breeze, would highly recommend."
"3701","It does deliver in terms of Internet Playback (especially NetFlix) and Casting from YouTube from Android devices. The screen cast from a Windows PC is close to useless, bad picture quality and lagging. The Remote control stopped working about two (2) weeks after first use and sometimes finding the device to be controlled by an Android smartphone is a matter of odds. I have had the need to reset the device (cut power) to make it funcional again serveral times during about a month of use."
"3702","I happened to be talking with my Daughter and Son-in-Law when visiting the UK. I mentioned that we had A-Prime and how happy we were with it. We had watched an episode of Goliath and they told me I could get it and more great videos and movies free with A-Prime. All I needed was a Fire Stick. So they got us one for Christmas. Talk about the gift that keeps on giving. Boy is it slick!!! It was so easy to set up. I am enjoying all the A exclusive content as well as movies and great music."
"3703","It works very well, however; I still have to pay for current movies that I could have paid for from my Directv.  I have started a Amazon series that is interesting.  At this point the cost of Prime $100.00 and the cost of the Firestick $40.00 don't seem to be a good deal.  If I buy everything I need from Amazon the FREE shipping will add up and reduce the Prime cost.  3 stars for now.  After I have it for awhile I may like it better. If I didn't have Directv this would be a better deal."
"3704","I love this thing! Even tho I say I'm loyal I admit to buying a Chrome Cast first. It was CRAP! There was a lag in the voice from my tablet to my TV. First you see the explosion then you hear it.I live in a place with really crap internet and I have some buffering problems with the stick but nothing that hitting pause for a few secs won't take care of. Now if Netflix would just figure out how to let us expats have our American Nexflix in our residing countries it would be perfect!"
"3705","I really, really want this device to work right, and MOST FEATURES WORK FINE, but...  Yesterday, I had to log in at least five times throughout the day on one of my Fire Sticks and several times more on another.  I've tested the sticks in two separate houses with two internet providers, and all the programs and apps work fine, with one exception:  Fox News sometimes gets very jerky.  I've tried two different internet providers, and it still is giving me problems.  Just this one channel."
"3706","When using fast internet, this stick is great.My only complaint is probably to rethink the interface and make it more intuitive and friendly. More on the lines of Apple rather than too Amazon-centric. Otherwise a great product."
"3707","Is there anything Amazon CAN'T do to make my life easier??? This thing is awesome! The setup is quick and easy and all I have to do is simply push one button and ask the woman of my dreams ""Alexa"" too find, play or answer anything I desire to explore and that's it.... Many thanks to Amazon for once again saving me time with my prime shipping, saving me money with the low prices and saving me a headache with such an amazing product like the Fire TV Stick and of course ""Alexa""... Way to go."
"3708","It's so much better and faster than trying to watch Netflix through my Blu-ray, and I could only watch Prime on my Kindle Fire because my blu-ray didn't have the app. Now I can watch it on my TV :-)"
"3709","Easy to use and set up. Tired of high price cable and yet still nothing worth watching. Keep ur internet and ditch ur cable or satellite. Pay for things you want to watch."
"3710","The only reason this is getting a 4 out of 5 stars from me is because although it advertises Alexa Voice Remote, we can't figure out how to use it.  Otherwise, it's great."
"3711","My son ordered the fire stick as a birthday present for me. My tv is very old, but it works! He took two hours on the phone to help me set it up.I added my Netflix account and love the device. I assume he kept Alexa for his system."
"3712","This is a good streaming device.  My only issue is that it doesn't have a slot for a micro chip to expand the memory.  The quad core processor makes it very responsive.  The price is a great selling point."
"3713","Fire TV Stick arrived and easily installed to television. No problem finding my WiFi secure connection and connected without any errors. I'm in the exploring stage to find what I can receive free. I do have Amazon Prime account, so some media content is available without additional $$ charges. Will update my review as I become comfortable with my Amazon Fire Stick with Alexa Voice Remote."
"3714","Love having this and not having to use the Xbox or PlayStation for Amazon video access! Kind of odd there isn't a power button on the remote though."
"3715","This plays Playstation Vue better than my other devices (Roku 3, PS3). The other devices always need to buffer every once in a while, sometimes they buffer often. This Fire Stick hasn't missed a beat once, yet. Also plays YouTube videos and Netflix perfectly. I love the voice function, I ask the remote to play whatever music I'm in the mood for (from my Amazon Music unlimited account). Super slick, really."
"3716","Super quick set up and can be used pretty much instantly. I do have some minor issues with freezing with some apps but other than that, It runs quite smoothly."
"3717","Very simple to use.  Gives our family many options for new things to watch, and music to listen to.  Would recommend to others (esp if they jailbreak it!)"
"3718","Had used the first generation fire stick, now upgraded to this one on one of my TVs. It's MUCH faster and I like the voice control option also, works great while searching for various desired searches. Great streaming with prime with tons of free movies and shows, also have the option to select apps and or pay for certain items. Can't beat the price compared to other devices I also have tried and this is by far the best for your money. If you DL a lot the fire tv version might be a better option for you."
"3719","These are a must have I would buy a second one. Met all expectations. Highly recommend someone out there buying one"
"3720","It comes with a charger, but if you don't use that charger, then Firestick continuously reboots If the power supply from the USB port is insufficient."
"3721","Very handy"
"3722","Amazon's products and customer service are by far the best I have ever seen.  The firestick takes all of the guess work and high prices out other other platforms out there.  This is a small investment for such a great service.  This is well worth the money.  You will not be disappointed."
"3723","It is very difficult to open remote to replace batteries, and then the batteries die very fast.  I use heavy duty batteries and they last about a week."
"3724","It's a good product easy to use however it doesn't come preloaded.  You have to select whatever items that you want and download them  activate each items by going to your computer or tablet and entrening a code. You can wear down the battery in a matter of minutes by going back and forth.  All in all its good ."
"3725","Still learning about TV without an antennae, so still a little confused, but what I do know is it is wonderful to not have pixelated pictures if the wind blows and heaven forbid if it rained no TV so I am loving this and almost too much to choose from, but we will find what we like and see what all we can watch."
"3726","I kept having issues with my chromecast...you cannot have more than one in the home or its a mess because it is a 'streaming' tool. I decided to try this New Fire Stick w/ Alexa Voice Remote and I love it! This is easy to setup, all my apps work and I can have multiple in the home w/out causing issues because I am not streaming from a device to the TV, I'm using my apps through the stick. The price is great, Alexa voice remote is 'simple' and easy. I've ordered a 2nd one for the house."
"3727","I purchased this under the assumption I would be able to use my voice with the Amazon Echo to also control my television. This is not the case. The voice command on the remote simplifies searching for items but always defaults to Amazon Prime even when you specify Netflix. And does not seem to be able to just jump to live TV.On it's own it's probably a fine purchase but, if you are using it to simplify multiple services and devices, it's just more clutter to add to the mix."
"3728","I thought and thought about buying a new smart TV but decided to try this fire stick to make my existing TV ""smart"".  I have to really justify spending for a new TV when the other works pretty well.  This fire stick works really good and with my Prime membership, I have already used the movie options more than ever.  I actually haven't tried the Alexa voice remote yet but could be a good option instead of hunting for things.  Sometimes I need to work myself into new technology."
"3729","I loved this remote from the moment I took it out of the box, initially, about a week ago. And then my Amazon Fire Stick did an ""update"" and all of a sudden, my remote did not seem as responsive. Not sure what is happening, but more than half the time it does not work on the first time around pushing the microphone button. It is highly frustrating and I'm considering whether or not I should send it back or see if a new one might be better. It's an awesome product when it works."
"3730","This has been a disappointing purchase. For some reason the option to adjust the screen display size in the Fire TV Stick Generation Two has been removed. Under the settings menu there is an option to ""Calibrate Display"", but it's non-functional. My TV menu does not have that option (the suggestion to remedy the problem) so I'm left missing approximately 20% of of the screen. All other functions appear to work correctly, but I'm left guessing when scrolling the horizontal menu!"
"3731","We all know why a majority of people buy these things and that's to 'jail-break' them. Well, I have a friend that has one and his older model requires a wall-plug to power, this one is powered by a USB cable that you can simply plug into your smart TV and no wall-plug is required. For that, 5 stars!"
"3732","I love mine. Ordered 2 more, 1 for my son and 1 for my father in law. Easy to install and setup. The voice option with Alexa is a nice add-on. Unfortunately, it doesn't offer many free options that you can't get included in the new Smart TVs. Most options are paid options or require a Prime account."
"3733","I'm enjoying the fire stick say no to cable. Hello fire stick watch all the movies and tv shows you want for free....The fire stick has to be jail broken and wifi is needed. It's amazing"
"3734","I love the fire sticks potential, but it keeps freezing up, dropping signals, and being unreliable. I have contacted Amazon twice. Eventually it works. For some reason it has trouble connecting to my internet when all my other devices do not have an issue."
"3735","Tried a competitive product to get Prime free movies and it kept buffering.  It was effectively worthless for whatever reason. l suspect an upgrade to a higher speed with my internet provider may have solved the problem, but I did not want to pay the monthly extra amount.  I then tried the Fire TV stick and it works like a charm.  When they say ""no buffering"" on the package, they are right.  And the free Prime movies and other stuff  available is great too. Have not used Alexa yet."
"3736","Love my Fire Stick and the endless amount of TV I can now watch! Super easy to use and love the Alexa interface. Kisses on this product, Amazon!!"
"3737","Great! Everything about it is great especially the price. Got mine on offer so that was even better. I def recommend this for anyone who doesnt have a smart tv and wants to stream videos or apps.5 stars! Amazon and Alexa WIN!"
"3738","Haven't learned everything this can do yet, but will learn.  It does let me view  CRTV.  Wish there were instructions on how to use all the power"
"3739","The FireTV Stick has given me much better clarity and reliability than my ROKU stick. Both are latest models but I have had no flaky internet and dropouts with the FireStick. I haven't explored all of the software channels, but at a first glance it has all the mainstream streaming access outlets that I am likely to need/want.Altogether, it's a quality piece of kit."
"3740","Still playing with it , have 2 rokus also , will be replacing them shortly ."
"3741","Took a bit over two weeks to get my fire stick from them...which in their defense they did state it would take that long. However, had numerous issues with the stick itself. Would take almost 30 minutes to load up a movie. Found someone locally who sells them look at it and found numerous programs were incomplete. Had to pay $35 to have the program reinstalled. Works great now. I did not give them the chance to fix the issue as it took way too long to even get it."
"3742","Trying to get it to work"
"3743","Still learning how to navigate but very happy overall!"
"3744","This has changed our lives. We no longer need friends. We're old and we hooked it right up. If the house is on fire I'm grabbing the stick and the dog. True story"
"3745","It took forever to have the product in stock.  However, once it was available, it shipped fast and was advertised.  It works really well and really fast and was super easy to set up."
"3746","I don't know why I didn't get one sooner. I don't watch cable, but this makes watching all of my apps easier. I have one in my bedroom and plan to get another one for my living room."
"3747","I don't watch a lot of TV so getting rid of cable for this made a lot of sense. Also I love the PIN lock out. No more waking up and finding my daughter already glued to the TV screen"
"3748","I normally have good things to say about Amazon but this one is the exception. I've had this Fire stick and remote for 9 months and it quit on me. I tried every trick in the book to get it to pair with the Fire Stick again (30 minutes on the phone with tech support) and the best Amazon would do is offer a $15 credit toward buying another one. Hmmmm. Your product quits after 90 months of gentle use and now I get to buy ANOTHER ONE? Not so sure,"
"3749","I was hesitant at first about getting one, until my nephew let me borrow his.  I had it jail broken and now. I can watch all movies even those in the theater now. Don't just get one. Get 2. You won't be disappointed."
"3750","love this device.  have had issues connecting wirelessly through other devices to get to Hulu, Netflix and other online applications.  the Fire stick is amazing.  no lag, connects the first time and its small size keeps it hidden."
"3751","I gave up my satellite TV and went with the fire stick with Alexa! Downloaded KODI TV for free along with Exodus and I get more shows and movies now for free! I haven't had much luck talking into Alexa, but the set up works great!"
"3752","Pretty good actually. Works at a decent speed. IT has a great response time and The Alexia feature is good with different accents. Will recommend"
"3753","Great device.  All my favorite streaming apps in one place and just as easy to use as my Apple TV.  Using the dircectv now app and I haven’t missed my cable subscription for a second.  Using other network apps for on demand shows, performance is great.  Easy setup, up and running in minutes and now no cable box clutter.  Highly recommend strong internet speed and solid wireless router.  Still paying must less than cable tv."
"3754","Great product. Once you install Kodi on it, and get the GUI set up, this thing is amazing. If you want to get rid of cable, get this, it will open up your world to a wide variety of TV, movies, and music."
"3755","Installation takes less than five minutes-it is easy to use and provides more choices of programming than cable or satellite-the options of Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc. give so much more entertainment choices and value-and I love the music and photo features. Rather than move one between rooms, I bought three for the convenience of having one in each TV room-the price is unbeatable. If you don't want to pay the high cost of premium programming, this is the best alternative. Highly recommend.."
"3756","Very happy.  We live out in the country and I have been extremely impressed. When the TV Satellite fails, I can still watch something via the internet."
"3757","Fire Stick arrived quickly.  I plugged it into an HDMI port on my TV, gave it my WiFi info and it fired up immediately.  All the channels and apps I expected, but a whole lot more! Have been using it for 5 days now.  It's fast, no problems with apps, movies, videos, or anything. It's small, no additional HDMI cable needed. Voice remote to launch apps works like a charm.  I just ordered another for a second TV in my house."
"3758","this is the greatest toy I've ever had.  I never expected to really be impressed, but i am.  the interface is quite fast.  Alexa is a bit less than perfect -- too many times she says she can't understand me. but that's OK because i am capable of searching.  this would make a great gift for just about anyone.  i am enjoying !"
"3759","Works great.  My tv wouldn't stream Amazon's videos, especially at night when internet usage is high.  Turns out the tv's flash player wasn't capable of streaming HD and couldn't be updated.  Firestick solved the problem plus I feel the picture quality is better.  I think I'm going to like Alexa too🙂.  Well worth the money."
"3760","I love to watch gospel videos."
"3761","For the most part it works great, but not on the TV I wanted it for. I bought the stick as a cheap smart tv solution for my old TV in the bedroom, but since the Fire Stick 2 removed the overscan fix feature, I couldn't adjust for the lack of overscan features on the TV. The stick really is a great product, but not being able to use it for what I originally wanted it for really leaves me feeling cheated out of 40 bucks. Hopefully there's a firmware update to add the feature in one day?"
"3762","The Fire Stick Alexa Voice Remote is the greatest thing since sliced bread. You have to know how to use it. Download the Alexa App to your phone or tablet and give it the skills you want. Find a Tech 12 yr old give him $10 and watch things happen. OK, Ok. Go on You Tube and watch the set up and do it your self. Wow go to search give it the voice command and you can look Movies, TV shows, Weather and other things, once it has the skills. My Name is Ken Vargas and I approve this review."
"3763","Got it for my mom and let me tell you she has been looooooving the fire stick!Been awake almost every night until midnight watching movies. You have to love movies to enjoy this thing. If you do then I suggest you get one she is not computer savy and I showed her how to work this thing and she got it down packed. Its not rocket science.It looks tuff to put together but its simple. Hope you enjoy it;) I just ordered me one because I want to try it they seem to run out fast!"
"3764","It's great but trying to open the fire-stick remote  to replace the batteries is horrific. 15 minutes later I'm still at it... and I'm still at it."
"3765","love this thing. I was accessing the internet through the Wii but it was a hassle.  Installed firestick easily and it works much more consistently."
"3766","Got my sister the Fire stick for Christmas last year and she loves, there is is much you can do with it. It’s a little entertainment center in one."
"3767","Great product! The only reason 4 stars is because the first one I ordered didn't work. But as always Amazon came through with an easy return, so I'm happy😉"
"3768","I love Amazon prime. Ordered last night and arrived in less than 12 hours. They are top notch and will keep using Amazon daily or weekly for all my shopping needs"
"3769","It came bundled with the Echo Dot and it was a worthy deal.  Plus, this is just as good as Roku but with a better presentation and User Interface."
"3770","Great item, I moved my original fire stick to my bedroom and placed this one in my living room. At night when the room is dark it is great to just simply press the Alexa voice button and search what I want to view. Although I have no means of measuring this but it also appears to function quicker. I would definitely recommend this to a friend or to anyone that does not have a conventional TV viewing schedule, plus it's nice not to sit though all the repetitive commercials and election campaign ads :)"
"3771","I am enjoying my fire stick very much, I like the fact that I can see movies that I have not seen in year's  the  70's 80's 90's , now I have to cancel my cable TV provider and I noticed that there is nothing on cable any more, the only thing that I will miss is the  news. How can I get my news ? ."
"3772","It works fine it's the second one I have had to purchase in less than a year.  I looked everywhere to see if the original could be exchanged.  Amazon is happy to help you with new purchases but older ones I couldn't find anything.  Except in the reviews where I found my experience was not isolated."
"3773","Perfect little device.  Bought one for my parents and gf after my own.  Even convinced 3 of my best friends to get one too.  They are just as pleased."
"3774","Disappointed that you still have to pay for so many movies and shows, There are thousands of free ,But it seems like a lot of the ones that i want to see i have to pay for them ."
"3775","We love our Fire Stick! We recently cancelled with our cable provider, because we were paying so much. We purchased a fire stick and also subscribed to Amazon prime video and we love it. We are also subscribed to Netflix but I like prime video more. They have a great selection of movies,shows and my son can still watch Thursday night football. The fire stick is very easy to install and navigate. Literally takes less than 5 min to install. Best purchase I've made."
"3776","Very Happy with this little guy, I use it with my Netflix,Tablo, Prime, and other streaming goodies. I use a box on the main TV and two sticks for the others. Too bad my ISP was slow and sloppy. I have not used other products like the Fire TV stick, didn't see anything way beyond this device line. Anyway, my brain tells me to get the most out of my Amazon Prime account."
"3777","I love this generation of the stick, such improvements since the original. Easy navigation. I haven't used the Alexa features yet, but I will eventually."
"3778","I bought this for the spare bedroom, basically because we had out of town guests coming in for the holidays. Thinking it would about the same as my other Fire Stick, but once I set it up, I quickly switched the Sticks from the Master Bedroom to the spare one. It is easy to use and I simply love it."
"3779","I love my fire stick. It's  amazing. The only problem is, I can't figure out how to remove my pin number. It asks me to input it every time I want to watch something. Other than that, it's a must buy for people who stream!"
"3780","I bought a fire stick six months ago and have used it sporadically since. The apps that are available suit my needs and usually work very well. However, the user interface is horrible. It is terribly confusing and redundant and always makes you preview and pass Amazon content. I understand that it is their product, but as a primary streaming player it leaves much to be desired. With a better interface, I would rate the fire stick much higher."
"3781","In order for me to use the fire stick, I had to purchase a new receiver. (My old receiver did not have a place to plug it in.) I purchased Netflix at the same time. I find Netflix matches my needs more. The games do not work well with the remote. You really need a game controller for proper use. I cannot access the tv chanells unless extra money is paid to Comcast. It is disappointing to find out more money has to be spent in order to use it."
"3782","Not too savvy when it comes to technology but this was easily installed and if you follow the directions is a cinch to start working right away."
"3783","Awesome device that our whole family enjoys.  Can do more with nit than I imagined.  Very happy with the fire stick.  Hardly watch cable anymore"
"3784","We bought this to replace a Roku, and we love this so much better. It works well and is easy to navigate.  We love the voice command option too."
"3785","Totally love it.  Bought so I could watch netflix on a older TV.  It does all I wanted.  Going to get another for a extra bedroom with no cable."
"3786","Works great!"
"3787","EXCELLENT!!! The Fire Stick opens doors to more programming options with more to watch. I haven't really used Alexa Voice to activate or open any apps but I do love to mess with people using Alexa Voice with the Simon Says skill - I could be in another room with the remote and have Alexa ask people's names, ask them what they are doing in my home etc. it's a fun little bonus.I would definitely recommend this product."
"3788","I admit that i was sceptical about the fire stick when I heard about it but it completely lived up to the hype. The toughest thing about it is that there is just so much stuff on it (movies, tv shows, live tv, movies etc.) that it takes a couple of days to learn about navigating it. But jailbreak it, pick and load a build onto it and you'll kick yourself for paying cable bills and not getting one sooner."
"3789","Does everything I wanted it to, was able to cut the stupid, expensive cable, along with an antenna to get local stations.  I highly recommend!!!"
"3790","It has more stuff in it that I will never use. However, the live TV is just what I wanted and the exodus movies are great. I would like one for every room that has a TV. Nice stick."
"3791","I've only used this once thus far, but I'm highly impressed. It came beautifully packaged, with a bunch of things to open, and plastic liners to peel. Setup was pretty easy once I figured out what input to set it on. I bought this mainly to use Netflix, and it was easy to get to and to use. I don't see me often using the voice function, so I like that I was able to search by selecting letters. It's nice to have the option! The remote is also small, inconspicuous, and straightforward."
"3792","Love that we can just speak a show title and go right to it. We're not technologically savy and were easily able to set it up. Received it for free by signing up and paying for one month of directTV now. Most likley because we have found the chromecast not comparable with the direct TV now. Have been overall happy with them though could use some improvement (ie. Shows turning off randomly, buffering, or not being able to load). Still no regrets on ditching cable. This thing is great."
"3793","Love the new Fire TV stick with voice remote.  I had the old fire stick, no voice remote, and I wasn't sure if this one would be worth paying again, but it was.  The voice remote saves a lot of clicking and scrolling and frustration.  The app also seems much faster in other regards as well.  All in all, I am one of those people who hates having to keep buying new devices or software to get the latest and greatest -- I need a really good reason -- and I think this was worth the money."
"3794","What else could I say other than amazing! I brought the roku at a big box store and paid $49.99 for it and was told I had to pay one time fee of 69.00 set up the roku.. No thank you!!! I ordered the fire-stick I received it in 2 days plugged it up and was ready to work"
"3795","The remote broke only a couple months after being used. and to get another one is goingto cost 29.99... and I will have to wait 1-2 months. NOT HAPPY"
"3796","Works as advertised. If your WiFi router is at a distance you may experience buffering. Cure?....buy a range extender, cue it in and plug in near your Fire unit and you'll have crystal clear HD (better than cable I think) and lightning speeds. Very happy with all the choices you have when cable is a wasteland."
"3797","I seem to have gotten a different model than most of my family/friends because it doesn't work like theirs.  My command screen looks different and I can't get many of the things (programs/movies, etc) that they can."
"3798","I am so glad to have ""cut the cord"" and moved away from those ridiculous cable packages. Fire stick provides all the TV I need in one tiny, affordable device. Never going back to cable."
"3799","Need an item that is easy to use? CHECK!Need to also be able to seamlessly log into Netflix, watch HBO & Starz or Disney Junior?  CHECK!Need access to the newest movies on the market for rental OR purchase?  CHECK!Overall this item works great.  We love our Fire TV.  It is easy to use and makes it to where I literally have EVERYTHING on one device.  I barely watch my DirecTV anymore.  It is that good!  Now they just need to come up with an ESPN app so that I can get rid of cable!"
"3800","Purchased this as a gift for my best friend that loves watching movies and sports, he loves it. It's so easy to travel with and I would definitely purchase again. This is actually the second one that I purchased. One for myself and one for him. I also have AppleTV and I love them both for different reasons. You'll love it."
"3801","Once you have one of your kids set it up for you it's the best thing since sliced multigrain bread! Having said that you do need amazon prime, Hulu and netflix to watch decent tv. But you will be done with cable forever. Best thing no fake news 24/7 if you don't want to see it! Enjoy telling spectrum that you are through with their lousiest service ever"
"3802","I love my new fire stick. I had enjoyed Bosch and Goliath on my Kindle but now that I can stream directly to my HD TV the picture quaity is amazing. I had no trouble setting up the Fire stick and the inclusion of the short HDMI extension cable was very helpful. I'm still getting used to voice controls but I think I will enjoy this feature in the future."
"3803","I love Fire Stick. I had it for a couple of years now and I'm buying another one. I cut the cable/satellite and use DirecTVNow streaming tv. And I also downloaded the Kodi. Fire Stick is the best investment."
"3804","I now own a total of three of these exact Fire TV Sticks.  I love them so much that I have cancelled my cable and just use these to watch my shows.  They are very easy to set up and come with all the channels you could want.  It also has Netflix on it for you to add an account there as well.  I will be buying more of these in the near future for my parents and in laws to help them in reducing their cable bills. I would recommend these for all your viewing needs."
"3805","I cut my cable. Bought a long range antenna and added Fire TV Stick. For $80 one time expenditure ($40 for antenna and $40 for Fire TV Stick)  and $8.33 per month, I now save $125 per month by cutting my cable....Great deal!!  It paid for itself in first month and is easy to install and set up in a couple minutes!"
"3806","Besides being a great device for such a reasonable price, this is the most user friendly device I've ever experienced.  It makes finding shows to watch unbelievably easy, just ask Alexa!  I want to buy one for all my friends because I think they would love it too."
"3807","This is the second Fire TV Stick that I have at my home. After I cancelled my cable I purchased the first one. When I constantly raved about it other members of my family purchased them. I like the fact that it allows me to search just as if I were on my computer."
"3808","I was hoping to be able to use this as a streaming media player from my local network storage. I was able after some effort to configure it to do so, but one day my Internet was out,and all I could see was a message that Fire Stick could not reach Amazon servers. Essentially a brick. Disappointed."
"3809","I have waited years to find a device like this.  The firestick is so easy to use that I didn't even need to read the instructions.  Further, there are so many features available that my expectations have been exceeded.  My only problem has been with my access to music as a Prime member.  For whatever reason, the Amazon Help Desk is unable to get me access to the music application.  After being on the phone for over an hour I finally gave up."
"3810","I love the stick.  Sometimes is takes some work to navigate through the list of movies then getting them to play."
"3811","We have two new Fire TV Sticks and use them primarily for Netflix.  They work wonderfully.  Easy to plug into the TV, easy to set up and easy to use."
"3812","This is the best purchase I have made this year it is a lifesaver when I want to snuggle now on the weekends with the blanket in the pillow and my dogs and just veg out on the couch thank you Amazon"
"3813","This was a great deal! Bought it on their Black Friday deals for $29, best money ever spent. I have the first gen Fire Stick and this one is faster to response times and connects quick to streams as well. Granted I am not using ""AC"" for connecting wireless, I am on ""N"" still, but for real techs that does not mean much, IMO. The Alexa remote is a bonus.  Still was able to side load apps without a hitch. All in all, this is still a good deal at their normal price of $39."
"3814","It turns that old dull TV into a smart TV without having to spends hundreds more. The apps are great and the apps that can be downloaded really make this product a step above the rest."
"3815","This is my 2nd Fire TV Stick, well actually 3rd, 2nd was a gift. This one is just so I don't have to move one from one room to another. I love it. Easy to use right out of the package."
"3816","Amazon Fire Stick with Alexa is an excellent addition to our entertainment package. Addition on the Kodi app was simple enough, ""even a caveman can do it""! I haven't had any issues or problems with it. I'm considering getting rid of my current TV services and just sticking the Fire Stick for all my entertainment needs. Packaging and accessories are what I have come to expect from Amazon. Delivery was great, even given the high demand and seasonal traffic. Highly recommended!"
"3817","This is a great unit that did not disappoint.  I have streamed music and video from my laptop (and used other devices such as Google Chrome Cast) to my tv and had to use wired instead of wireless as the connection speed here is slow (5 meg/min) and I need all the help I can get.  I purchased the unit with very few expectations but was very surprised at the results.  I can easily stream had movies with no lag or speech mis-match.  The Alexa device is great too!  I will purchase more!"
"3818","So happy me and my wife recieved this as a Christmas gift! We couldn't wait to cancel our AT&T tv services. Too expensive for not the greatest service in the world and we definitely didn't even watch half of the channels we had. The Fire TV Stick allows us to watch exactly what we want to watch, when we want to watch it without all the extra fees and crap. The setup was extremely easy as well. Now we're saving an extra $70 per month that can go towards something else. Great product!"
"3819","Easy setup. Nice portability. Quality is OK. I got it to stream DirecTV Now and ESPN. It also provides the same apps my smart TV has, so it's somewhat redundant. But maybe that adds a level of convenience...or maybe confusion when sometimes it's easy to forget which HDMI input I'm actually watching. First world problems... My smart TV however does not have Alexa, so once you get used to speaking to your remote instead of pushing buttons, it's actually nicer than using the TV apps."
"3820","It is for another TV in another room and it is just great. I had an older version that broke and they have really improved things - including the voice recognition."
"3821","Love it. For years I used my Samsung Blu-ray with Samsung Tv for Amazon  but streaming was ridiculous. Followed included instruction to the ""T"" and setup was easy. Viewing is perfect. Couldn't get iphone (10.3.3) app to work. Doesn't list my device and nothing happens when I hit ""Sign in"". Will keep my fingers crossed that I don't misplace remote. I still very pleased with Fire TV Stick."
"3822","Works great trying to see if I will get Amazon prime to go with it right now I have Hulu  and all the free stuff ! Very happy with the performance and the price for sure !"
"3823","Really worth buying if you have prime and if you dont have prime start thinking about getting it it is worth every penny.A lot of movies and shows to pick and choose"
"3824","Yes, very convenient and saves money sort of... you have To pay for the different subscriptions like Starz, but the prime members can maximize the movie options with the Prime Movies as a member, which Chrome does not do."
"3825","Should have bought one of these a long time ago. Tech savvy and good with google? Then this will be the best entertainment item you have owned."
"3826","Don't have Alexa. Don't want either. Too much interaction. I do have the Fire TV Stick. Amazing the coverage this ""stream stick"" gives."
"3827","It was very easy to install and the picture is amazing. I have a roku3 and the picture has never been this crisp. I am thinking of buying more."
"3828","It keeps telling me connected with problems. Slow speed. I'm getting 50mbps which is more than sufficient. .... very disappointed and yes I'm less that 5ft from the router"
"3829","So far, it works perfectly. I really can't find any difference between this new one and my old one which I'm using in another room. Both respond to the same voice commands; both work seemingly at the same speed, which is fine; and both have identical menus. If one is faster than the other, I certainly can't tell. The only drawback was there's no way to use an HDMI cable to extend it away from the TV as there's no HDMI slot on the end of this new one like there is on the old one. So, it just dangles off the end of my TV. Other than that, works flawlessly."
"3830","Absolutely the best since Peanut Butter and JellyI rarely write reviews but had to on this one.It does everything it says it does.Make sure you download the KODI app to experience it all.The Alexa works great. It understands everything I say and makes for a fast search.Currently I transfer the stick between my TVs but soon I will be ordering one for each of my TVs just for the convenience aspect.Thank you Amazon Fire Stick!!!"
"3831","Used to have the Apple TV but many of the campgrounds we visit have a captive internet server (password protected) and Apple TV couldn't connect.  Bought this little thing, plugged it in and was set up within 10 min.  I love it!"
"3832","Just like my other firestick, works pretty well but occasionally has issues which require a restart. Then again I did buy a second one, so it can't be that bad."
"3833","Easy to set up.  It has good WiFi connectivity, even though it is in a location that is sometimes spotty.  We like it so much, that we're going to order one for each TV and use this instead of our cable TV service."
"3834","Easy to set up, reasonable price. Make sure you double check the resolution on your TV. I was first gonna get the fireTV but my TV is also 1080i DPI so it wasn't necessary to spend more dollars. If you are only browsing Youtube, netflix or Amazon Prime movies but doesn't care much about resolution, this is def a great buy."
"3835","It's really great. Only part with lexa is you don't get the apps main menu like say Netflix. It's more you have to say...show me western, and the sift through all the rentals and buys.Another example is their own Prime. I like it when I open it on my smart tv and it has the rows of your stuff and my favs, included with Prime. In other words free."
"3836","I like it just find but the voice activation doesn't always engage....I also have the one w out voice activation from last year and its great"
"3837","I am really enjoying my Fire TV Stick and the the Alexa Voice Remote which gives me access to all the wonderful programs on Amazon and Netflix!"
"3838","I am not a millennial but it was so simple to set up neither I nor my spouse lost patience with one another or had to call support. I live in a totally dead zone and want to cut the cable as it so expensive for our minimal demands. Free programing on the Firestick more than met our expectations with the exception of live local news. We'll see how it works with CBS All Access and if it does I'll be totally satisfied. Who knew it was so easy."
"3839","I have 3 Roku units now. I bought this to take when we go camping with the voice control it it just what I needed....And all of them are about the same.."
"3840","In my life I only wrote 2-7 reviews.. but this is the time I wrote one again! Its so worth it! I use Kodi with it! THANKS AMAZON!!!!You can buy 5 of these to fill your entire house with fire sticks its very affordable.Just having thoughts on buying an Amazon Fire TV... Any thoughts would be appreciated!Would it be faster for using Kodi?Less Buffering for Kodi?Does it utilize your internet speed more than the firestick?Thank you!"
"3841","Works as it should . Easy set up . Takes some time getting used to a new way of watching TV for us older folk . Directtvnow and Sling and the other streamers need to hook up with TV GUIDE for a on screen guide for the live channels they carry annoying to have to check tvguide.com on my laptop to see whats on or do a lot button pushing on their screen like clicking through each channel to see whats on they need a tvguide channel . That's not the fire stick fault though it's great .."
"3842","Love it!!  Use Alexa Voice Remote a lot! (Just because it finds what I want 100+ times faster than I can!)  Plus the Fire Stick is more convenient and user friendly than any remote I've ever had before.  The Fire Stick TV Channels are much more in tune with what I like to watch, like having a personal guide.Purchased another Fire Stick for my daughter who was using a different type....she loves the Fire Stick w/Alexa Remote!!  Immediately removed the other media player."
"3843","I don't have cable but finally bought a Fire Stick to see what all the hype is about. I wish we would have got one sooner! My husband downloaded a bunch of hunting and sports channels. But there are channels for anyone! Can't wait to try Yoga on the fit channels."
"3844","Really like the Alexa function, it makes searching the library easy especially when you are looking for a specific title.  Always a fan of the fire stick."
"3845","We got rid of cable because it was costing us a fortune and we never watched it because we have prime video, Netflix, Hulu and a few other streaming apps. We love the fire stick because we have everything all in one place. It was a nice surprise to be able to play games with it too. We are planning on getting 3 more for our bedroom tvs."
"3846","Firestick works well, remote has horrible range. Have to be within 5 feet for it to work correctly. Don't want to return just for the remote. But I know it could be better.Update: a second unit was shipped out. Had same problem. Identified that it had to be something with the bluetooth. I have a Samsung TV that also uses bluetooth for the remote. I used a female to female hdmi adapter and a short hdmi cable to move the fire stick away from the TV. Problem solved. Remote now works perfect."
"3847","The fire stick is so easy to use and set up and works great. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants easy set up and use. The price is amazing"
"3848","This is remarkable piece of simple ,efficient Device that make your life around tv way easier .it make so much fun to navigate and fooling around ."
"3849","I am delighted in the number of tv shows and movies available to watch.  The regular t.v. stations are also available.  The only disappointing thing is the difficulty I encounter when I try to watch live sporting events."
"3850","I bought the fire stick so we could ditch the high price of cable. Best choice! Easy to navigate and the kids love Alexander voice! I have recommended this to several family members and friends who are equally satisfied."
"3851","Love it. I bought another one for the bedroom and will buy one for guest room eventually.  It works fast and it's nice having all my apps in one place. Will eventually drop satellite but right now one room has an old tv."
"3852","now my wife can waste all the time she wants watching garbage TV shows in between not working. awesome!"
"3853","For me, this is easier and better than the full Fire TV. I use it in conjunction with Apple TV, and switch between the two, with no cable box."
"3854","This is my 2nd Fire Stick (1 in living room & 1 in family room.  Works great and allows me to watch the various Amazon movies & TV selections."
"3855","I am still having issues with knowing what to ask Alexa. I am not finding Alexa easy to work with as this is my first with anything like this."
"3856","Love it the best one. I have a Fire TV Stick but not the Alexa voice one. So bought this he Alexa Fire TV Stick The bestone. Very easy to use."
"3857","I purchased the Fire TV stick so I could lower my cable bill. Internet  bill  has gone up. Alexa doesn't work or doesn't understand me though."
"3858","Great little gadget. Works well and very little lag if any. Plus you can download android apps onto it with no problems. Wouuld def buy again."
"3859","The overall quality of the Firestick is excellent. Video quality is great. The voice command needs a little polish. But would still recommend."
"3860","This is the greatest buy I have ever made. I love this thing. It's easy to use, once you get used to it. I'm thinking of buying another one for the bedroom."
"3861","So first of all it seems to work great so far with one notable exception the remote freezes up at random intervals, it will work fine for a while and then suddenly nothing, I open it up take out a battery put it back and it will work again for a while. Have found out that the phone app works all the time so for all intents and purposes the remote is useless! So as I would recommend it to my friends, it is with the caution about the remote."
"3862","Runs rings around my older model which stopped booting altogether. Customer service replaced the defective stick with the new better model, works like a charm!"
"3863","I bought this to smarten up one of our televisions. I also have Apple TV on another tv as well as Smart TVs. My biggest hang up with this device is that it locks up typically when not used for a day or so. We have to pull out the tv to get access to the power cord. Inplug it to reboot. Then it's fine. It's a pain to do this. Ive only had it for a few months and have lost track of how many times we have to unplug it. I've had  Apple TV for several years and rarely have to reboot it."
"3864","For what this does, it does it well. It is a gateway to AI in your home. I fully intend to get an Echo at some point- but I can't say I really have a strong need at the moment. You do need connected ""stuff"" to take advantage. However, the Firestick is very handy.I like it can keep an ""eye"" on so much for me- My only wish is that it would stay awake like Echo does and I didn't have to make the move of turning ON the tv, then activating Alexa by pressing the control-"
"3865","Clunky interface, as Prime content shows up at the media level in ""Recent,"" interspersed with third party apps which have to be launched and then media selected. Also, Alexa voice search of third party content seems to require some redundant logging in and doesn't do a great job of keeping track of, e.g., previously viewed episodes. But, I don't use iTunes, so this brings me way more of my content than Apple TV did. Also more stable network connection than my '13 Apple TV."
"3866","The Amazon Fire TV Fire stick is easy to set up and use... no need for extra parts, everything included. I like that it tells you what is included with Prime and what is for rent or to buy..."
"3867","It has not meet my desires yet . I thought this would be better than cable but I haven't found out how to get into it just yet or Better yet get the shows I want on it"
"3868","I am very pleased with this stick, the 1st one I had the remote was not working properly , but Amazon replaced it with no problem. Must have especially if you don't have a smart tv."
"3869","I bought my Fire TV from Best Buy so this won’t be a “verified purchase” review.I love it! All of my different platforms in one place.Easy access, lots of potential apps.I give it 4 stars only because it glitches sometimes. It either won’t play or it crashes the platform I’m on (netflix\hulu).Otherwise it’s amazing!I had the chromecast before this, but I got tired of having to use my phone to control everything."
"3870","What a simple and inexpensive tool to add to my big screen tv that opened a port to the future of tv viewing.  Remember when UHF channels were added to historical VHF channels to allow for more local broadcast tv options?  Adding the Fire Stick is kind of like that too but even better.  Now instead of adding one or two stations it adds an unlimited number of viewing sources that grow seemingly daily.  Great investment in the future and today."
"3871","I love my Fire TV Stick. If this is the same price as the store you can skip the 2 day shipping and get it the day of. Remember when comparing prices that this one is the Alexa voice remote (you can press a mic button and ask her to pull up shows and apps, the non-Alexa one is cheaper but older."
"3872","I love it! The remote has Alexa, but it isn't always listening. You have to push the microphone button then speak. This is great for me since I don't like the idea of Alexa always listening in, and this is the fastest way to search. Say goodbye to clicking around the screen one letter at a time!"
"3873","My bedroom TV is an older flat screen TV (not a smart TV) that I used with a blue ray DVD player to stream Netflix.  Even though I have excellent broadband service, about half the time it would not connect.  This little device is wonderful.  Very easy to get started. No more connection problems."
"3874","Love it, works better than I expected. The only issue I have had was trouble downloading a particular movie. Don't know if the trouble was the Fire Stick, my internet or the service I ordered it through.Will be dropping my Dish service when contract is up."
"3875","Excellent!  Works much better than either of my old Roku sticks or MXq TV box.  The interface is well thought-out, and we're having a blast with great TV, having ""cut the cord."""
"3876","Easy to install & navigate. Even my nine-year-old son has an easy time with it, and he doesn't normally get much screen time with electronics."
"3877","Took longer to receive than expected - apparently so popular or new upgrade caused a reduction on inventory. It was easy to install. Worked well from the getgo. Bought it so I could watch the Feeln network. Connecting that took a bit of effort, but works wonderfully. So far (only had it for a couple of days), would highly recommend it."
"3878","I really like the firestick, however I got it with a Hulu promotion (part of the reason i purchased was for the two months of Hulu free for those who never tried Hulu before!). I clicked the link to get the two free months of Hulu that Amazon sent me, signed up, and was informed it was for one week only. When I tried to get this fixed with Amazon I was told to talk to Hulu about it. So needless to say I got ripped off on that deal. Still a good product, but be careful about any deals you get."
"3879","LOVE IT!!! We only have an antenna on our TV. No cable or satellite because didn't feel like we got our money's worth for what we paid. Love getting Netflix!"
"3880","very nice. do not use like I thought I would but like having it. can watch most anything i want with it. lots of choices I would buy it again."
"3881","where I live in Vienna,Me. most all of the service offered by Fire stick don't work because we don't have an internet or telephone service that will provide movies.All we can get is mostly what is on you tube and national news and weather but nothing local and fire stick does not explane any of that before you buy it.If you sign up for satellite TV then you can get better service but thats what I am trying to get away from, the rip off satellite  programming."
"3882","I have an older Fire Stick and this new one is much faster with the quad core processor.  It is as easy to operate as the old one but it is better with the Alexa Voice control.  The voice recognition is excellent.  I would say it is better the the latest Roku stick except the TWC application I use is missing from the Stick.  It would be nice is Amazon provided it's own casting application.  I have tried using some casting applications without success.  If TWC app and casting were there I might have rated it a 5 star."
"3883","2nd firestick purchase, I love this device. Cable free for almost 3 years now, didn't think I could cut the cord but now I don't miss it at all."
"3884","I got it to watch Prime video. Alexa works with Netflix too and that's really handy. I side-loaded Kodi and it has no trouble using plugins and a MythTV DVR. There's plenty to watch.Lots of other apps can be side-loaded. Web? Yep. RDP client? Yes. VPN? OK. Games and other random stuff? Depends... Mostly it's for TV.All in all, it's a great little unit whether you want an easy way to add smart features to a TV or as part of a larger media interface. I would recommend it!"
"3885","My Husband is a big fan of TV and this is exactly what he needed.  He is happy with the product and it was very easy to install.  I would recommend this product and the seller to others."
"3886","I love my new Fire Stick with voice commands. I have an older one with no voice, and I like it fine too. But, the new one is just a bit nicer. The remote's buttons have a nicer clicky feel that I really enjoy. It also seems to load everything much faster. I haven't used the voice commands too often yet, when I do it saves me loads of typing so I can get to my stories quicker. I certainly do like the new Fire Stick and if I could use more than 2 I wouldn't hesitate to get another."
"3887","It sometimes takes several tries to get the TV to connect to the firestick, including needing to remove and replug into the TV, but once working it's very nice.  The picture quality is at least decent, if not quite as good as over the air broadcasts.  At least on CBS all access the sound during commercials is significantly louder than during the program.  On the better side of the coin, there is an immense selection of programming available, including things people are most likely to want to see."
"3888","I fired cable and saved $140 per month. I should have done it sooner.  It is different than cable but once it's all set up it's easier and more options not less.  I'm using sling, amazon prime and Netflix w 40mbs speed works perfectly"
"3889","Not much to say about this except it blows the competition out of the water! The Fire TV Stick has helped me ditch the cable company with no thoughts of going back!"
"3890","The Fire TV Stick is a good product but I am very disappointed with Alexa.  Alexa frequently get things wrong.  Also, Alexa cannot play albums from my Music Library"
"3891","WITH NUMBER  OF LOUSY MOVIES THAT ARE NOW ON DIRECTV THIS IS A SUPER ALTERNATIVE, KEEP IN MIND YOU MUST HAVE PRIME TO GET THE BEST OUT OF IT."
"3892","Better than Apple!!! Love the fire stick , so easy to hook up. Loving how easy to used , conntected your Netflix to it an have. Netflix day😍"
"3893","I enjoy this product. It is easy and simple to use and the response time is solid. This one is an improvement over the last one they put out."
"3894","remote control does not respond all the time, and is not the rang. you have take the battery out and reset ."
"3895","Very very nice product. The only problem is the parental control to avoid kids buying things, the pin code is not the best way to handle that"
"3896","Quick response to every app. Works well and never lags even with our relatively slow internet connection. The wifi range is very good. It picks up full signal in our master bedroom which is upstairs while the router is downstairs on the opposite side of the house. Would definately recommend to anyone looking to get rid of cable. Kodi is very easy to install and use."
"3897","Ive purchased 2 of these. The 1st one lasted about 4 months and stopped working and the 2nd one about a month and a half and the same thing happened, it just locked up and stopped working. There made of a very low quality hardware  material it seems... I did very much enjoy watching the movies and series it offered though. Only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1."
"3898","buy it... it's the best, when your tired it makes you coffee, when your sad it sends you balloons, when your hungry it shows you Bobby Flay quips which makes you more hungry, so then you can use Alexa to order some fast food, ...  when you get fat from the fast food you can watch workout videos......"
"3899","Love this firestick"
"3900","It works great but unfortunately I have Charter Cable. Charter and Amazon fire TV don't work together. I returned my amazon fire TV for something that works with charter cable."
"3901","So far in the three weeks we have been using this we have loved it!! We were able to save ourselves right at 100 a month on satelite bills!!!"
"3902","I use it a lot more than I was expecting to. I use it for Netflix, Hulu, Pandora. I no longer need to use my Blu-Ray player for these things."
"3903","This is my third stick and they've all worked great. Excellent response and great content. We cut the cord last year and couldn't be happier."
"3904","Love. Grandkids,6 &8,  figured it out in minutes. Totally portable. Take it on trips and get whatever I want without paying hotel fees for movies."
"3905","I have an older fire stick in another room and have put this one in my bedroom. It is nice to have the voice control on the remote to avoid a lot of fumbling to find a channel or show in the dark. The only drawback, and not enough to make me not buy it, is the back is difficult to remove to insert batteries."
"3906","I love how convenient this device is. I got rid of my Dish Network years ago because it was costing me a bundle. But now, I can enjoy T.V. again without crying every time I see my wallet collect dust.  I am not a fan of commercials, but, I can ask Alexa to turn on some music while I wait until the show / movie come back on. This is so wonderful I got it for each T.V. and I am so glad I got this than ROKU. There is just so much more to do on Fire TV Stick! :)"
"3907","We're switching over from Apple TV because the UI is  not very good and the remote not very responsive. We've used the Fire TV stick and remote  side-by side and the remote with alexa is much better. However, the software navigation on the underlying channels is more complicated and less intuitive than Apple TV...I'm guessing because Fire supports more UI options.  But, these differences are annoying...Hence 4 rather than 5 stars. Maybe we'll get used to them OR maybe we'll justt ry raku."
"3908","Easy to set up.  Came earlier than first date given.  Too early to tell about all the movies and such but we looked up an old old series called Combat and it had the full series available.  My husband is really excited about that!  Thank you!"
"3909","I like the quality of the audio and video - 5 for that. The interface via the remote and voice control not so much - 3 for that. Overall I like it."
"3910","This is a great addition to the television for watching movies, prime tv and using Netflix. We loved the one we got for Christmas that we purchased a second one for the basement television ."
"3911","I love the firestick. It has all the apps I need and with numerous free games!!!! This new one I can speak to it so that's great for playing my music."
"3912","This thing is just great. I got it to install Kodi and had that done within a hour of plugging it in. I will say that you need to use the usb and power adapter that come with the unit or else you will get an endless loop rebooting screen happening. After fixing that small issue, it ran fast and worked great. Kodi goes on easy, of course I am experienced with programming and computer software and hardware building, but looking it up on Youtube there are plenty of great tutorials."
"3913","After being told for the third time by warner cable that my ""special rate"" had expired and after my 3rd 20.00 cable tv rate increase in less than 2 years i was able to install this firestick and double my programming with just a few apps and a 99.00 a year Amazon Prime membership, cancelled my cable programming and cut my bill 87.00 a month.  Buy the firestick,  go with the high speed i ternet only package and tell your cable provider to cram their phony ""deals""!"
"3914","Yes, the upgraded Fire TV Stick with Alexa is vastly better than its precursor. Match snappier with a faster processor & the voice activation is a must now!"
"3915","Purchased this for my mom so she could easily stream video on her smart tv. Set-up was simple and seamless. We had everything hooked up and working within 15 minutes.She's not the most tech savvy (though not a technophobe!), the fire stick is very simple in that there aren't a crap ton of buttons to confuse the user. Typically, when she gets a new electronic device, I'm there to help her trouble shoot quite a bit. Since setting up the fire stick, she hasn't called once to ask for help. Score!"
"3916","Works great.  I got rid of normal satellite and just stream my tv now.  and it took 100 dollars off our monthly tv bill.  what is not to love."
"3917","I just received my second Fire Stick the other day and I am so happy with it.  My first one is still on my TV in my bedroom and this 2nd one I put on my TV in the living room.  Besides watching all of the wonderful shows/movies from Amazon Prime, I also watch Netflix through the Fire Stick.  I'm a very happy customer!!!"
"3918","We've always had Roku boxes so when one of ours started going out we were planning on replacing it with another Roku. I saw this on a Black Friday special and went ahead and got it because I trusted it since it was from Amazon and it had a better price than the Roku devices. We love it.  I can't say enough good things about it.  No more problems with freezing and reboots like we had with our old Roku and the functionality that comes with Alexa is great.  Our kids love talking to Alexa."
"3919","If you're thinking about it, get it! You won't regret it. I use it everyday since I got it. Youtube, Pandora, Netflix & more. Its so easy and convenient."
"3920","everyone should own at least one of thesethis combinde with a good digital antenna will save you literally $1000's of dollars a year on tv service."
"3921","I love my Fire TV Stick with Alexa.  It was so easy to set up and so easy to use. I highly recommend this product as a means of watching a lot more than any cable service can offer."
"3922","Works great. Some channels you need to pay a subscription. Does not replace cable channels. Good movies. Voice commands works good. Major League Baseball you need to pay for as well"
"3923","Worth every penny , I am also purchasing an HD antennae and will be disconnecting my cable very soon. Tired of paying for stuff that I don'twatch."
"3924","So far so good only wish that it had a on and off switch I unplug mine because some people say it gets hot I don't want to burn out a power switch would be great"
"3925","More to this little devise than exspected easy set up had a little problem with the alexa voice but I watched some of the help videos they are very helpful thankyou so far working well and enjoying we cut the cord back in March just using the Fire TV and over the air TV."
"3926","I love this firestick..it has a fast speed, very convenient to install because it's  small unlike the box..but best of all is that i can talk to it which makes it very easy to deal with. My package arrived on time and in good condition...am very  happy with this product."
"3927","Super cool.  We don't have cable TV on our boat so our TV viewing is limited.  With Wi-Fi and a Fire Stick it was so much fun to have so much to offer now.  Our Wi-Fi isn't that strong so the video comes in a little buffered but still worth it!"
"3928","This thing is great.  I couldn't believe how small it was perfect size . I'm not very tech savvy and I could not believe how easy it was to hook up I didn't need any help from anybody . I could not believe the variety of movies in series and music on this I feel my cable company has been ripping me off for years and is soon as I get used to working with it I'll be cutting the cable"
"3929","Easy to hook up. Often slow in loading requested programs and does not work well with ""splitter"". This maybe a problem with splitter which I plan to return"
"3930","Love the Fire TV Stick for price and portability I have a Fire TV on my main TV but use the Fire TV Stick on all the other TV's. I also have one that I keep in my luggage for when I travel. Works great using the free Wi-Fi in the Hotels as well as when traveling to friends and relatives houses."
"3931","Works fine, I bought this as a gift for my daughter to replace a dead ROKU Box. She loves it, easy setupb and operation. Highly recommended."
"3932","I absolutely LOVE my Firestick!!! My husband and I decided that cable is just too expensive so we decided to get the Firestick and I'm so glad I did!! That's $175 a month I will now be saving!!!"
"3933","Easy to install, was up and running within minutes.  It's small so it will be easy to take with us, have had no streaming problems or Wi-Fi issues."
"3934","Easy to use once I became acquainted with the steps described in quick start directions. Taking advantage of many offerings I could not view before"
"3935","I really like the firestick itself, but the Alexa remote doesn't work. Used the batteries it came with- nothing. Replaced batteries, still didn't work.  My phone works as the remote, thank goodness, but I feel like I got cheated."
"3936","Does not support vudu.  I use vudu for all my digital format movies.  Other than that huge downfall its good.  Again, does not support vudu."
"3937","I use this everywhere. It has come apart of my daily life. I am so glad amazon offers such an amazing product. I have bought 3 of them and gifted 2. And the 2 I gifted them too love the fire stick as well. So many apps and tons of free trials. I highly recommend this over an Apple TV any day!!"
"3938","I am very pleased with this product. Have not experienced any problems and we are enjoying some great entertainment. Looked at several other devices before going with this. The smart tv being used with it did not support a lot of the newer apps, so this is ideal. Definitely worth checking out!"
"3939","Excellent device!  Hooked up with no problems, set up was simple and it has worked flawlessly.  We also own a Chromecast but to use it you have to have your computer running.  We could have just connected our computer to the television directly and had the same result.  This computer interface is not necessary with the Fire TV Stick."
"3940","Working great on a second TV but my subscription to DirectTV Now did not reflect the larger channel option that I had subscribed to earlier on the Apple TV.  It's like on the Firestick it defaulted to as if I had just now ordered the a few months back when DirectTV Now had a promotion to receive more channels if you ordered then, which I did for viewing on my Apple4 TV.  Navigation with the Alexa remote is great and supports all of the options on Alexa which is in another room."
"3941","We received our Amazon Fire Stick and have already been loving it! We purchased it for the television in our room as a streaming option for Netflix. We have not been disappointed, and we have found ourselves moving it from room to room. We have made plans to bring this along with us on camping trips this summer, since we all know how unpredictable weather can change even the best laid plans. Thanks to the many features of the fire stick, we may be planning to cancel cable soon!"
"3942","I'm using the stick on our ""other"" TV as opposed to our main one, that the kids have hijacked, and primarily viewing Netflix with it. Plenty of alternative subscription content providers to chose from also. Setup and user interface are user friendly.Remote feels a little cheap and hopefully will stand up to the field testing my kids will give it. But it streams buffer free for me, with the stick a good 60 ft from the router.Overall very good value for what you get"
"3943","The firestick came with an extra piece incase the square firestick case didnt fit into the slot well with the contour of your tv set.  The firestick fit fine, however, it buffered at 25 percent forever and i thought i would be very disappointed, but after reading the instructions again, the extra piece that was a thinner wire was ALSO an amplifier for the firestick to reach the home internet, and once I attached that, it worked fantastic.  Good thinking to add that extra piece."
"3944","Just getting onto high speed broadband I got the Fire TV Stick to try and got a great experience. Was already setup for me when received and have enjoyed the streaming movies from Amazon and NetFlix. Well worth cost of the unit. Was disappointed that it could not control the volume on the TV. Did have one little problem, I struggled for 15 minutes getting the battery cover off the remote to get started. Other than that it's a great device and understands everything I say to it."
"3945","Device works very well with Sling TV.  Have not experienced any buffering, slow play or adverse actions at all. The voice remote works very well.  I like the user interface with the remote.  Very simple and useful.  I used it with Direct TV NOW.  The new streaming service from ATT, but had to drop the service.  All the shows were buffering and freezing constantly.  Had nothing to do with the Fire TV Stick.  Direct TV NOW just has a lot of bugs.  Would rate the Fire TV Stick A+."
"3946","This is my third Fire Stick so you know I must really like them. They're not compatible with a lot of remotes so switching inputs means switching remotes and that's a bit of an inconvenience.  But I knew that going in (no unpleasant surprises) and I continue to value what the access brings far more than the inconvenience detracts from the remote.  I also find that even with other services (Netflix, for example), I just use the Amazon portal because it's so simple and intuitive."
"3947","Superb unit. Returned a Roku device for this one. Internet reception much much better which gives me a clearer picture."
"3948","I really enjoy my stick. It is easy to use it on my other TV. I really like having to use it when I travel and the hotel's TV program is limited."
"3949","Plug it into an HDMI port on the TV, plug it into a power outlet, give it the local wifi password and it works. Stupid simple and solid function."
"3950","I have Apple TV also, I like this more.  The fire stick is completely customizable.  Down side,  not as user friendly as Apple.  Having tech knowledge, it's fairly easy for me, but I wouldn't recommend it for someone that's not comfortable with new technology."
"3951","This product works great and allows us to connect our TV (without WiFi) to our internet WiFi and watch Amazon TV (and others).  Would recommend."
"3952","I ordered the Fire TV Stick at the beginning of the month but it was the new one so got it around the 20th of Oct. Set up was a snap and I am so impressed with it, I am going to downgrade my cable to basic. After all, I can't ask my cable box what the temperature is outside, or ask it to find my favorite WWII movie, and the Fire TV Stick does all this and a thousand times more. Only have had it for a short while, but so far I am super-impressed, and I am usually not easily impressed by anything!!!"
"3953","A great upgrade.  It seems to run smoother and faster than the older models.  I haven't used Alexa on it yet.  Can't go wrong with the Fire Stick."
"3954","I like the fire stick but I could not access my Echo Dot.  It would not sync and I couldn't find Amazon Fire Stick in the Skills on line.  Bummer!"
"3955","I bought this All-New FireStick for my husband so he could stream movies. Neither of us are very tech savvy (but we're getting there) but the FireStick is so easy to use.  It works by asking to it to search for movies or tv showsor you can use the remote.  By having Amazon Prime it works on our living room tv that only has cable - no special box. Um sure we'll learn even more as we continue to use it. Between the Amazon FireStick  and the Amazon Echo Dot, we have adopted Alexa!"
"3956","So far I'm having problems with it.  It does not work with older Televisions, does not show the picture only the sound.  Have to unplug it from the extension cord I have it on every time to gain access the Firestick picture.  Very disappointed in it."
"3957","Works great. My bedroom smart TV is old and Hulu etc would not update anymore (nice to make you buy new VIZIO) This Fire Stick works great I even added some channels with the help of YOUTUBE. Really reasonable price too."
"3958","This little device is pretty amazing. It is very responsive to voice commands. That is as long as you keep most fairly simple. The video looks good and crisp with no lag or buffering on my Wi-Fi that I can tell so far.  I haven't had cable in over 6 years and have been using a computer in the living room for streaming. It has served its purpose but time to scale down a bit. Perfect addition to the media center. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a streaming media player."
"3959","This is perfect for the technological learning! I bought this for my mid 50's parents hoping to teach them a few things about technology and all the options in today's world. After a brief 5 minutes of set up and explanation the two of them where flabbergasted about how much they have been missing and started utilizing Amazon Prime almost every night! I would suggest this product for the tech savvy as well as the newer users of today's ever changing tech world!"
"3960","Easy setup still learning love it"
"3961","Far exceeds what I imagined it could do.  I love it.  It takes the place of my other remotes.  Getting use to having less gadgets.  Thanks Fire Stick!"
"3962","We are having some connection problems with it but hope to get them resolved soon.It worked initially, but now is not recognized by our Visio TV"
"3963","I got the product for it's intended use and it's super glitchy. I use Netflix, Hulu, and Starz and I'm constantly getting sever crash error messages and force stops. I also get network connection errors, but my laptop and phone are connected to the same wireless and I don't get network error messages on those devices. I'm a little disappointed but I don't spend a lot of time watching tv so I guess I can live with it."
"3964","works fine,but--- way more pay programs than free. 9 out of 10 times if you want to watch it you have to pay for it. this includes old movies."
"3965","Purchased to watch messages and videos that are on vimeo.  Was able to add the vimeo app from my smart tv using fire tv stick but there is no search function.  Even tried on computer to add video to my watch now list.  It didnt show up on tv.  Very dissappointed with this purchase. Poor menus and poor voice recognition"
"3966","Very happy with both our Fire TV sticks. Saving big money not paying for cable and the programming is fantastic!!! Our electric bill went down over $30 a month too. I didn't know the cable boxes and DVR's were using that much power. All in all we have Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime...Total monthly savings $120 a month."
"3967","Had used Chromecast for over a year and wanted to give Fire-Stick a try.Fire-Stick wins hands down. Better functionality, easier to use and works all the time every time."
"3968","works well. easy to install. had issues with first set and replaced overnight by customer service. second set is not having same issues. yet do not watch this set for long periods of time or multiple channels. yet all apps work well and all prime services available work well. pleased with product. only knocked it down because of initial problems. have not had second set long enough to ensure problem has been resolved.but very pleased with customer service."
"3969","I like it.  It connects to all of the streaming services I use (Netflix, HBO, and Prime video) which is very convenient though not exactly unique because I can do the same on my PS4, XboxOne, WiiU, or my PC.  It is a better choice than those other options I mentioned because it doesn't take close to the amount of energy required for those devices.  One thing I was disappointed with is that the Alexa voice remote only works with the fire stick and I was led to believe it would work with my echo."
"3970","I thought this would be the ideal way for my husband and I to be able to have more variety in our tv viewing, but not so. We have AT & T U-Verse which does not support most of the apps on Fire TV Stick. Every app we tried to load was not supported by U-Verse. Sadly, we had to return the Fire TV Stick to the store where we purchased it. People should be made aware of this problem BEFORE they buy it."
"3971","We love our Amazon Fire Stick.  So easy, goodmovies and Alexa works good.  So happy webought it.  Having Amazon Prime is a plus also(Free movies, free 2 day shipping and 2-5% backon purchases)."
"3972","Easy to set up and use. Took me about 4 to 5 minutes from opening the package to watching movies. Greatly reduced my monthly cost to my cable provider by no longer having to pay a monthly fee to watch movies. Now I do that for free."
"3973","Extremely fast arrival, extremely easy setup, generally amazing so far EXCEPT that when resuming play after pausing, there is a short burst of extremely loud static..."
"3974","We purchased this Fire TV Stick because it would allow us to stream Amazon Prime content on our Vizio SmartCast TV (the SmartCast app does not support Amazon content directly).  It was simple to install and activate, and so far has worked well for streaming both Amazon and WatchESPN content.So, I am happy with the device, even though I am not so happy that it was necessary to have it in the first place.  I do wish Amazon and others would play better in the sandbox."
"3975","All in all it's a good set up. The one thing you need to watch out for is the audible or voice reference system. Let's say that you are in Netflix and say the selection in stead of typing it in. It will take you to that movie always out of Netflix into a pay on area. What you think you are getting with a membership to Netflix is actually charging you more money in a separate area. In my opinion this feature needs an update. Other than that one flaw, it's a really good product."
"3976","We received this as a gift. As far as I can tell it's pretty much the same as Apple TV. We receive antenna TV so our internet provider who also provides cable doesn't allow us to watch some of the better shows. If we had cable TV service then we would be able to watch the shows we probably would have watched already on cable. I'm sure we haven't discovered some of the other benefits but honestly we are just not that interested. Also we don't want a hot microphone in the house."
"3977","It works as good as I had expected...considering I had to go to the mainland to purchase it, since you refuse to shipp it to Puerto Rico!!!"
"3978","Alexa Voice makes this a preferring Streaming Device for using Amazon Prime.Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player"
"3979","Works great, BUT, I hate that I had to buy this to stream amazon movies on my 2013 samsung ""smart"" tv. Technology is always changing making even 4 or 5 year old smart tvs obsolete. WTF?"
"3980","Love the FireStick, the only bad thing is I can't download Vudu on it. If vudu was available I would give it 5 stars. But it does have tons of apps that I do use and apparently you can download games, my kids found that out."
"3981","By comparison to other streaming players this is the smoothest by far. I leave it paused for hours with no problems. I'll probably buy more"
"3982","I love my new Fire TV Stick.  Only wish there was a way to load a VPN Service directly to the stick for when traveling outside the country."
"3983","Loved it the second I plugged it in.  The voice control makes it so easy to find what you want.  Child contros are a pain but so worth it to keep little ones from buying stuff when they​ get away from you.  Hulu app is a bit glitchy but that tends to be true on a lot of platforms."
"3984","So far out. I have prime membership which make the fire stick even more fabulous. I've had so many happy viewing hours quality programs. Also I listen to my music and watch music videos on my TV love it so much"
"3985","Easy to use but my son installed it. Small problem with Comcast, their service people had to troubleshoot when a ""no WiFi"" alert was on the screen.  Otherwise we really enjoy all the programs available."
"3986","Works well.  In my opinion it isn't any better than any of the others.  Plus you'll probably never use the voice automation feature anyway."
"3987","Working on trying to reduce my cable bill and installed this and gave the remote to my wife. She has been using for the last week and loves it! She is working on learning to use the voice system but is loving everything else. Very east to setup and was using it withing 10 minutes. I also have the ROKU HD stick installed on another TV and she finds it not as user friendly as the  Fire TV Stick. Plan to order another Fire Stick to replace the ROKU that will be shifted to another TV."
"3988","WE LOVE THIS!  It is going to help us save $400 yearly on unnecessary pay channels on cable tv.  I could not have made a better choice EVER!"
"3989","Works way better than our first firestick! Alexa voice remote is awesome and our three year old has even been able to press the button to find her favorite show. The overall layout is better as well"
"3990","The fire stick with Alexa voice control is amazing, especially for the price. Instead of flipping through categories to find show, I just ask Alexa and within seconds I am watching what I want. Fire stick alone is amazing, but now with Alexa it's even better."
"3991","Wow the ease of this new fire stick is awesome.  Being able to talk to Alexa is pretty nice vs always searching and typing in what you want to find.  ALexa finds movies, shows , amazon prime, netflix, etc very quickly.  Job well done Amazon  Now I can use my TV to pull up you-tube when I do my spinning classes."
"3992","I've used fire sticks for a while. I have always liked them. It took me a minute to learn how to use the Alexa feature but I really like it."
"3993","The Fire TV Stick is everything that I hoped it would be. It was easy to install. It is easy to use and the voice commands work like a charm."
"3994","While I like the idea of the Fire TV Stick there is too much typing and I gave 3 stars precisely for that reason. When I think about signing on I think about all the typing first and whether or not it's worth it to login.  The answer most days is no, especially when I know the unit  is going to throw me out of the app and I will have to login again.  If this is a problem that Alexa can fix I would raise my review to 4 stars.  But for now color me annoyed."
"3995","It is amazing. It was a very easy set up. All I did was plug it in and Alexa did the rest. Works great. I am very happy with this purchase."
"3996","I made a mistake and restores it back to the factory default. It took a little while for the stick to find the remote again. I unplugged it from both the outlet and the tv. I tried switching the. I took the batteries out and left them out for hours. And finally it found the remote. I was starting to get a little nervous. But after all that it works great. Can't wait to see all the stuff it can do."
"3997","I bought several Roku and Apple TV devices for my home when I gave up cable. I will be replacing all of 5 of those devices with an Amazon fire stick. Best streaming quality and consistently of ANY device. There isn't any buffering, pausing or freezing when playing back. This is the best streaming device on the market."
"3998","I have been ""living with"" an apple tv (older generation) for a few years, and just feeling there had to be more out there.  I bought this New Fire Stick w/ Alexa to try out when it was on sale for $29.99.  I cant believe what I have been missing just hanging on to the apple tv.  I also downloaded Kodi (jus tsearch for Fire Stick Kodi and all the directions are on youtube) and now using Netflix, Amazon Prime and Kodi - the Fire Stick is the only thing I watch - period."
"3999","We really enjoy our Fire TV stick. We got it because neither our Apple TV not Smart TV supported Amazon Prime Video and we wanted to take advantage of our Prime membership. Now we use it for all our online video streamingthrough our TV. Easy set-up and very user friendly with a lot of great additional features. Only a few glitches in playback here and there, such as selecting to watch a new program and it randomly playing a previous one. Other than, we're quite pleased!"
"4000","Love love love this! This is my second firestick purchase. I fell in love with the voice remote and simply wanted one for another room in my house. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys having all the features and apps in one easy too use device."
"4001","Works great.  We bought this for our 6 year old flat screen TV in our spare room  (not Smart) and wound up with another Smart TV for a small price."
"4002","This is my 4th Fire, the first with Alexa, is faster than previous gens and runs smoothly, a great buy, don't think it too much, this is it"
"4003","Decent collection of movies and free apps available for download. I moved to a different place where I use to connect to Netflix through the PS3. Now, the router is upstairs so I'm unable to connect directly and this works extremely well being wire free especially with my toddler running around. The voice recognition is amazing. My husband has a thick accent and usually google voice can't always recognize his voice, but this does. I highly recommend this, makes your life easier."
"4004","Got this for one month's prepayment of DirectTV Now.  So far so good.  Picture is much better than the Amazon app on Tivo or my Vizio M50-C1 - not sure why because everything is set to 1080p/24p but I'm not going to complain.  We cut the cord from Comcrap and we now have everything we want for about 1/3 the cost we were giving those weasels plus all the other Prime benefits.  Only thing is that we must use the Amazon remote, we can only switch to the Fire with our Harmony One."
"4005","I am planning on cutting the cable cord and this is a big help.  I can stream the same channels I watched on cable.  There are several streaming services out there to choose from."
"4006","Really enjoying my new Fire TV Stick.  I travel frequently and use my Fire TV Stick at most hotels...beats trying to figure out the local programming.Highly recommend!"
"4007","While the firestick is wonderful, I did struggle over installation. Not being any sort of tech savvy person, it took me several days to figure this out. Youtubes were not at all helpful.  You might consider including in the directions to make sure to set your input to HTML. While this may be obvious to people used to technology, those of s who are a bit older or have not been involved with technology need to have a Tite more guidance."
"4008","This thing works great.  I was concerned about there being lag or freezing, but that hasn't happened.  I'm definitely happy with this purchase."
"4009","I love it. Fire TV Stick is so easy to operate. I love the screen saver when I have to pause my movie. I am wanting to get another one. For my bedroom."
"4010","I like it very much, but why just four Stars because you had to pay for every single channels, with differents amounts. You apps store it doesn't show you the free channel or which ones are pay per view."
"4011","Getting ready to cut the cord on Dish. I’ve become so tired of paying for 200 channels when I only want about 12. This solves that issue. Adding Netflix and HBO next."
"4012","I love this thing!! and thank you to whoever designed it... it is so easy to set up!!! and believe me... I am electronically challenged!!! and the voice feature is AMAZING!! just say what movie or show you want to watch and .... Abra-Cadabra! your movie is there... just hit play!! SO HAPPY!!"
"4013","OK -I'm not a big tech geek but I'll give the basics. Great connectivity .. especially in my old block home and my TV as far away from the wifi as can be. Easy set up - easy to use. No problem with Netflix, YouTube, ect.  Love the layout , interaction and menus. Alexa responds well. I love it !"
"4014","Love this. Streaming was new to our family and we are adjusting without our DirectTV but so far we really like it and have enjoyed binge watching our favorite shows.  Works without any issues."
"4015","Like Fire Stick real well but there are a couple issues; Alexa seems to have trouble understanding me....Second, it might be my imagination, but since acquiring Fire Stick it appears that the amount of Free with Prime recent release movies has dropped off...I fully understand the current, just off the big screen would cost, but some of the more recent say in the last year are carrying a price tag....But for the most part I'm happy with my purchase and in fact I own two of them!"
"4016","These things are so convenient. i travel with mine all of the time. as long as there is an internet connection i'm watching movies on Kodi"
"4017","Easy to set up. Love the programming I'm getting and the selection that I have. I mainly been on Netflix, but will try other apps as I go."
"4018","Love love love this thing. Has been perfect for my daughter when she wants to watch one of her shows and awesome for my husband and I too."
"4019","I had to get a new one because the remote was defective.  The buttons wouldn't work all the time.  The new one I got works great, however."
"4020","We have 2 so far - we cut cable out of the house and are not running only on Fire Sticks. They are great and easy for my kids to maneuver."
"4021","The Fire TV Stick I purchased was a on the whim. I was frustrated with my bluray DVD player that would just turn off and on. Decided I would look into just turning my regular tv into a smart tv. That's when I found Fire Tv stick and I love it plus the fact I can talk to Alexa to check out the weather or find my favorite shows or movies is absolutely awesome! This by far is one of the smartest purchases I have made."
"4022","Yea ao far so good. They were wasy to ser up. We put them in the bed rooms. Our daughter loves hers. We like it so much we are now considering the Fire box for our livingroom."
"4023","I haven't had a chance to use it yet other than the set up which was sooo easy! Bought ""PRIME""arily to watch Amazon videos. However I tested it and it works very well!"
"4024","So far so good!I do wish I could have everything on one remote, but for now we are coping.I am trying to get rid of cable.  I can't quite do it yet, but I'm close!"
"4025","I've only been using the fire stick for 2 weeks now but so far the reception and responsiveness have been better than using the apps on a tv or blu-ray player.  My one complaint is that other that Hulu and Netflix.  Logging into the apps is cumbersome.  You have to open the app then get a code that you need to enter online via the app website.  You should just be able to login from the fire stick screen without having to go to another device to register."
"4026","We love our Fire Sticks!!!.........I have bought 4 and they work great.  We cut the cable and we still get our favorite shows plus movies."
"4027","Easy to use, good variety of programs. I also have Apple TV and the Fire is much easier to use, the cost is exceptional compared to the Apple, $150 vs $40."
"4028","Easy, plug and play.  Love the price! The menu is so easy to navigate. Lots of Apps to add!  I used Fire TV Stick when my HDMI switch box died.  I love it!"
"4029","This is my second fire TV stick so I'm a satisfied customer. For the price to get youtube, amazon, netflix and more this thing is an absolute steal. Works great, easy to use, priced right. 5 stars."
"4030","Great product.  I really enjoy speaking to the remote.  The apps that are available allow you to enjoy live TV.  Guess what!  You can still use Netflix.  I enjoy it more than the Google Chromecast."
"4031","Well I'm still surfing and trying to figure some things out. I thought I didn't need a cable provider and tried to watch a favorite tv show and it said I had to have a provider. So I went back with time warner but still having issues watching things it says I'm not authorized is it because I'm not a prime member? anyway we'll see how it works out"
"4032","It is amazing to be able to access any movie or TV show we can remember, as well as all the new ones! It's complicated to use. I had someone more gifted in technology help me learn the basics. It also takes some time to access shows, but so much better than 15 min of commercials every 30 min. As we get better at using it we like it more and more."
"4033","I love the amazon fire stick! It was well worth the money. It is small and can used in multiple tv's in my home. I spent my weekend watching some of my old favorite tv sitcoms and movies. I'm thinking about getting rid if cable now. I only gave it 4 stars because there were a couple of movies that wouldn't show up or needed buffering through the entire movie. Otherwise, I would have rated it a 5."
"4034","My son purchased the Fire TV Stick for me and I couldn't be more pleased .  Easy to navigate the menu.  Love the voice activated feature!!"
"4035","Never thought of buying a product like this until I came across it on a Cyber Monday Deal Day.  I feel like we have a smart TV :). We have a Toddler, and it's hard to follow our cable movie schedule.  With this Fire Stick, we enjoy watching movies any time we want.  Having Alexa option is a plus.  One thing I still can't figure it out, or it probably doesn't work is how to tell Alexa to play a VDO YouTube.  Still... I will recommend this product to anyone.  Thank you Amazon."
"4036","Does not give the ability to adjust picture size to fit TV screen. This cuts part of the top and bottom of the picture. Fire Stick 1 allows this adjustment in the its settings. FS2 says to adjust using your TV and not all TVs have that capability.  Would of given it a 5 without this problem."
"4037","Seems okay but did have to take the batteries out once and put back b/c TV was not responding.  Also love the voice recorder at the top of it."
"4038","After almost a month fire stick works as advertised no problems opens apps fast except for Kodi for some reason, Kodi tends to lag and takes some time to open and use. But Amazon approved apps work great fast and responsive will update review as time progressesP.S it seems that stick gets hot and lags sometimes"
"4039","The Fire Stick was easy to set up.  It solved two basic problems we were having.  The first, was constant buffering while trying to watch Amazon Prime videos during peak usage hours.  It has not buffered at all since we installed the fire stick.  The second, problem was that we have a Samsung TV and Amazon no longer supports Amazon music on it.  The Fire Stick allows us to access our music library without any issues.  For the price the Fire Stick  is an excellent investment."
"4040","We are very pleased with our new Fire TV Stick. A bit of confusion to start off with, but that could just have been me!There are so many shows to watch. A lot more than expected. We are hooked on so many series now...not saying that's a good thing...just saying!"
"4041","This was great and meets our expectations!!! Set was easy and we are using it very actively as with our first one. Keep up the awesome work Amazon!!!"
"4042","Cutting the cable was made so much easier with this.So many options and clear photo.Alexis finds what I need most of the time."
"4043","Another fine Amazon product.  Works as advertised.  Even though I had to wait three weeks to  receive my unit, it has met all expectations.  Even better, my amazon prime account was set up 'out of the box'.  Amazing"
"4044","Love-Love-Live💗 As an apple consumer this device is refreshingly versatile and user friendly. It has opened up our viewing option ten-fold. It is so easy to use that we prefer it over using our Smart TV app option."
"4045","It’s okay and all but at times it goes really slow and will buffer often. Don’t really have that problem with my Roku stick or appletv so it’s not an internet speed issue."
"4046","The new Fire Stick lived up to my expectations.  I'd experienced some buffering--frozen picture for 3 or 4 seconds--with the old Fire Stick, while streaming on such sites as Neflix.  I already had the latest modem from AT&T for my area, so that was not the problem.  As a last resort, I ordered the new Fire Stick:  Instant improvement.  Have not seen any buffering at all since I got it several weeks ago.  Liked it so much, I ordered a second one for my other TV.  I recommend it."
"4047","Good.....love the stick. My only complaining is apps that say free then when you download them you find they are not. Need to separate the real free ones and the one you pay for."
"4048","Excellent piece of technology. Remote is flawless. Speed of apps is perfect. Get Kodi for firestick (look on YouTube for how to install), and the access to entertainment is limitless"
"4049","It is a great addition to my Amazon Prime subscription.  Movies and shows at your fingertips andit is so easy to set up.  The initial stop on the way to cutting the cable cord."
"4050","Was really enjoying this product until suddenly my remote stopped working. After spending 20 min on the phone with amazon customer service on the phone I was told I would receive a partial refund to purchase a new remote. Then I was transferred to trouble shooting to no avail and the call was dropped(not on my end). So after spending approximately 30 mins I did receive my refund or a solution to my problem. Will update once Amazon corrects their mishap."
"4051","Love the option of just asking for what I want instead of having to type one letter at a time and taking forever to find something. Also love that it looks at all options for something. So if you're just really in the mood to watch a specific show or movie you ask Alexa to find it and she brings up all your options such as Netflix, Prime, etc. Then you can choose which platform you want to watch. Money well spent!"
"4052","Unhappy Alexa doesn't control more on the TV. It doesn't turn channels or turn TV on or off. At first it didn""t even take us to Amazon Prime. After much searching and playing with different settings, we figured it out some but just as fast to push buttons as it is to say it."
"4053","Its a winner for me. I got 2 download an app and watch my Korean Dramas on a TV that I couldnt b4..My husband loves mo ies, so he downloaded a movie app for his viewing pleasure...love this firestick😍❤"
"4054","I eliminated cable TV over a year ago and purchased the fire stick. I have not regretted the decision. This is my second firestick and I love them. I've added tons of apps and it's just like regular TV."
"4055","I have an older Fire TV Stick and the new one is much more responsive.  I have not used the ""Alexa"" voice commands much but I am much happier using this new one than I was with the older one.  I am still using the old one on the bedroom TV but it is frustrating how slow it responds."
"4056","This is a great alternative to your cable. Very easy to use and just plugs right in to your tv. You can download apps and get many shows to watch"
"4057","This product is difficult to use and understand. I would like to return it; however, I kept trying to use it therefore my time has run out on the return.  Not happy."
"4058","I love this, I swear my TV even sounds better! Wish I had gotten it earlier. Streaming is so much better...and I live in the middle of Alaska where internet is slow."
"4059","Easy to set up. Easy to use it. With Amazon Prime a lot of content to watch, listen, etc., and so much useful apps. I haven't talked to Alexa yet but I recommend to anyone that has Amazon Prime to get this amazing product."
"4060","Bought it as a Chinese Auction prize and it was one of the most popular in our fundraiser. The winner was a college student who was excited!"
"4061","This item was very well packed and complete. It was easy to connect and get working.I still have a lot to learn. Lots of possibilities."
"4062","Works great on my smart tv for times I want to use other apps. And I love the fact that my Bluetooth headset works through the Fire TV stick."
"4063","The reason I love the Amazon Fire Stick better than the Roku and other similar devices is because I travel a lot and spend a lot of nights in hotels.  In the hotel you have to sign into the internet with your room number and last name.  The Fire Stick allows you to do this because it has a web interface, the Roku does not have this interface and can't be used.  You can MAC spoof the Roku, but its kind of a pain and you don't know how to do that if you aren't a nerd like me."
"4064","It is really more up to date the the fire stick I had before.  It also a lot faster.  If I know what I am looking for I can just ask Alexa."
"4065","Fire stick is a great device. I use it primarily for my media watching. I was happy that Netflix is also included in this. I am yet to explore the entire app store. But so far, i have got plenty to watch and it seems like Amazon is doing a good job in keeping the apps and the OS up to date."
"4066","Wk finw thx"
"4067","Super easy to set up on your television; just make sure you have a power source nearby and an available port. I installed Kodi and now I have access to all movies and shows! It's awesome! You can also install various apps such as Netflix, Hulu, etc, but Prime TV comes pre-installed for you."
"4068","It’s ok.  Thumb drives a portion of the size of the fire stick have 100x more memory.  I feel the memory and ram is where the firestick fails.  The compression with streaming needs tweaking as it falls behind with certain services.Portability and the remote are nice.  Gui is simple. Plenty of apps missing and I think it should accommodate both iPhone and android to reach a larger audience."
"4069","I really loved it. Once I got logged on and learned how to use it (I needed to figure it out as it was a gift for my mother so I could teach her) and I loved the features. I am looking forward to getting one for myself. I loved the features and how well it played as well as the sound quality. And it was affordable.Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player"
"4070","Perfect little cable / satellite cord cutter boxes.  Can do so much with these.,  I even loaded Kodi onto them for even more versatility."
"4071","They need to be adding more movies more frequently, but other than that this is pretty great if you already have an amazon prime account."
"4072","Love this....it's great and saves us tons of money versus paying for cable.  Plus, I feel like we have more selection as far as channels."
"4073","Our daughter highly recommended the fire stick. She brought one with her when she visited and gave us a demo.  We ordered one right away and probably will order another.  We haven't even started to take advantage of all it has to offer yet.  So far so good."
"4074","I love this thing, I have 2 of them! I watch free movies, commercial free with Amazon Prime on my TV. I don't enjoy watching the Prime movies on my laptop, but do on my large TV's. The picture is like being in a movie theater. Love, love, love these things!"
"4075","This is my first Fire TV stick after many years with a Roku stick. The Roku seems flimsy but I love the design of this Fire stick. The connector piece gives it the stability that the Roku lacks. So far I feel I made the right choice switching to Fire stick."
"4076","The Alexa on this is not as helpful as the dot. Says it doesn’t know a lot of things when the dot can find the answers. Or be of service."
"4077","I'm really loving my new firestick, although it's taken me a little while to get the hang of picking out shows to watch.And I love Alexa!"
"4078","When I first received this it was working fine.  Now I put on Netflix and every show says cannot be seen now---try again.  I thought it was my internet connection but that wasn't the case.  I plugged in my Roku 2 and Netflix was working fine!  Very disappointed!'After writing this Amazon contacted me.  I did what they said and fixed it.  It is working great now.  Thanks amazon!"
"4079","Can not believe how much Free movies you get, you really need to be a Prime Member to rake in the befits. Voice remote works fairly well."
"4080","Get rid of cable and save some money. If I may borrow a phrase ""If you like paying higher prices than that's your business or if you own a Firestick and pay lower prices that's Amazon business"
"4081","I've had this for a few weeks and it works better than expected.  I have watched movies on amazon and netflixs without issues. The response to the apps is faster than my WD live."
"4082","I am very happy with this product.  It has virtually made our older 50 inch tv smart.  It is nice to know we can utilize the big screen as you would a newer tv."
"4083","THIS IS GREAT PURCHASE.  BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION, CAN A SECOND FIRE STICK BE USED ON ANOTHER TV IN ANOTHER ROOM UNDER THE SAME PRIME ACCOUNT"
"4084","Nice device if you want to try something different.  Device was well within an affordable price and packaged well. Delivery made on time."
"4085","The addition of Alexa is a nice touch. I don't have to keep flipping through the menu to find the app or media I want to open. The new processes definitely makes it load media and apps faster."
"4086","Works great and has turned my bigscreen into a treasure chest of Amazon goodies and all other apps. I love Alexa too. Highly recommended."
"4087","I love it!!! I can watch my shows on it and even watch movies that just came out in theaters. If anyone is waiting on getting one, don't. I recommend getting from him. He will answer any questions you have and even call you to talk you thru how to use it. He has great videos to help you also. Just the best service. I sent my friend to him to get one. I will purchase more in the future. It's so worth it. My only complaint is that I didn't get it sooner."
"4088","The fire stick is AWESOME!  The movies, games and music is truly extensive!!! With this stick you don't need cable tv at all!  A wonderful invention! I love it!!!"
"4089","Love it! nuff said.Now, if you want the long version, this little device is one of the best products here and now for home entertainment.  Plug it in and your all set.  I have one for all the TV's and gotten them for family too.  My 70 year old parents are using one, thats just how easy it is to use."
"4090","I bought the fire stick to use up at my cabin where I only go once a month if that and purchasing cable or satellite TV subscription would be a waste of money the fire-stick worked fantasticly it's an awesome product I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to bring TV programming with them or has a flat screen that isn't a smart TV and would like to make it a smart TV for less than 40 bucks truly great product."
"4091","It seems the corporations and engineers haven't perfected this device. Watching amazon streaming movies getting dropped right in the middle of viewing is discouraging. Having to adjust routers or rebooting or making phone calls and internet searches for answers is also a negative. So I'm not happy with these circumstance. They have most things together but the problems with dropping internet service is a problem."
"4092","Five stars but the cord from the TV HDMI down to a wall outlet needs to be another two feet longer. Some people have TV's on top of dresser drawers which can be 5-6 feet tall."
"4093","Yes. No trouble installing. Had a bit of an issue getting set up afterwards. Granddaughter came over. We accidentally bumped into using Alexa remote to key in information to assign wifi service. After that, smooth sailing. Getting used to all our PRIME features, etc. Love movies with no commercials...and uninterrupted PBS series."
"4094","It works about 85-90% of the time. We live very rural area nearest store like 30 mins. So satellite was only option. Think again I have 100’s more channels than ever. Only buffers, a little. Certain channels are worse than others. Considering the purchase price very reasonable, and only $10 month for directtvnow.com its awesome!!"
"4095","After using this fire stick for only one week, the programming froze.  Rebooted, verified network connections, remote is completely frozen and will not work.  Only one person using the remote, no children, no water damage, no reason whatsoever and now stuck trying to determine if the problem can be fixed after spending $40......."
"4096","Love my firestick. Easily converted a old TV I have in the kitchen to a smart TV. Bought one, and now I'm up to 3. Load Kodi and it's even better.  Had Chromecast, but that's a pain when you have to use your phone."
"4097","Excellent device navigation ,Alexa very cool I am recommending to all friends. Now if somehow you can get Alexa fire still to control lights during movie time WINNING!"
"4098","When I figure out how to make Alexa turn down the volume on my TV it will be perfect.  Makes Netflix work better and Amazon Prime is great."
"4099","Seems to be as advertised. We haven't had much time to really go through everything it does as we haveonly had this for a week or so."
"4100","I love my firestick. I thought I would have some problem setting it up but, it was a breeze! the first thing I asked Alexa was to play Justin Timberlake. I'm getting another for my daughter."
"4101","This is the best and even better when you get Kodi installed on the fire stick!  Had the Roku for awhile and it was no where as good as the Fire Stick"
"4102","Does the job and meets expectations. Flexible for connecting to different TV's is a plus. Cable to power supply could be a little longer though for those of us that us the 110 volt ac connection/power."
"4103","Best purchase I've made!  TV reception is bad so I use online streaming.  The menu is easy to use and the unit can be moved to different TV's in the house.  I will be purchasing one for all my TV sets!"
"4104","I was very excited to switch to Firestick after having Roku for the past 4 years. In comparison the firestick has long load times and it's never easy to just throw something on or continue watching a show. I have to restart it at least every other day because it is unable to go to the home screen then will work fine. Its not a horrible product but just a big let down with all the little things."
"4105","Works great easy hook up. However run ur power source directly from the power strip or out let, running directly from ur usb power on cable box dosent have enough power to run it, it kept kicking it off.  After connecting directly to the power source with the enclosed usb adapter solved the problem."
"4106","freaken awesome, should have ordered 2 more.  I ordered 2 about 2 months ago after this set and they still have not come.  this works awesome though."
"4107","works great my husband loves it and he went ahead and cancelled many of the channels we had with our cable with a savings of over $30 per month."
"4108","wow this awesome and comes preloaded with what you need.  but i love it cause i use directv now as my provider for viewing channels.  its a must have for all"
"4109","Being of a ""certain age"", I was concerned about my capability to take advantage of all this has to offer.  Even I can make it work!  Yay!  Thank you."
"4110","Love this thing. We have 3 now.  One for every tv.  We used to have streaming through Chromecast, XBOX 360, and a Firestick.  But now we just use all fire sticks to keep everything the same."
"4111","Amazing product with a lot of features that come with and endless optimization with this thing. Would recommend to anyone with a little tech knowledge to invest in this device. Amazon fire stick is amazing!!"
"4112","it worked find the first two weeks then everything just vanished I still had my favorites but everything  else was gone, I sent the person I bought it from an email telling him what happened but he has never replied, I have been working on it trying to fix it for the past month now but I still haven't been able to repair it.Thank You,  Roger,"
"4113","Great, I can get to Netflix or Amazon Prime shows rather quickly, no problems, before the fire TV stick I had so many issues with Netflix."
"4114","After asking friends if they like using the Fire Stick I purchased one. So happy I did! I can finally enjoy all the perks of my prime membership on my big tv."
"4115","I thought I was going to get I lot of channels which I did but you have to buy the shows you wanted to watch. I did not like that at all."
"4116","I got this because I was in love with my regular Fire Stick, and it's even better than I imagined! I used my tablet as a remote for my old one to make it easier to type in the search field, but with the voice remote I don't have to! All I have to do is say ""Play the news"" and it gives me highlights from the day and the weather. I recommend it to everyone I know is looking for options other than cable, which is almost everyone I know, and this is the best deal there is!"
"4117","I love the fact that everything I want is in one place. It works seamlessly. What a great piece of equipment to add to your electronics."
"4118","I love, love, love my new fire tv stick.  I love the fact that I can talk to it and get what I want on tv.  I am very satisfied with it."
"4119","What can I say?  There is nothing I dislike about this. It's wonderful. I love it.  So easy to use. Every one is made better and better!"
"4120","In all fairness, this works fine but I just don't like it at all!  I got it as a replacement for a Roku 3 since buying this was cheaper than replacing the Roku 3 Remote.. The Fire Stick just doesn't cut it as a replacement for a Roku IMO.  I find it much harder to navigate, the order of things seems counterintuitive and confusing.. I hope to be able to return this and have ordered a new Roku 3 remote as well as a new Roku Express to replace the Roku Stick in the guestroom."
"4121","These are awesome. Too bad Amazon doesn't always keep them in stock! Between fire sticks, and echo dots, Amazon is taking over my house!"
"4122","I can't stop watching.... It has video games too... This works well with mya Harmony universal remote. If you have prime this is a must."
"4123","Simple to set up and easy to use.  I'm constantly on YouTube and Netflix and it's perfect for allowing me to stream content on a large screen HDTV.  It's perfect for streaming my needs."
"4124","I love this and use it to stream instead of high cable tv bills. Hulu, hbo now,showtime, & starz apps are great along with amazon videos"
"4125","I like the Fire Stick WAY better than my Apple TV - it's faster, easier to use, cost significantly less, and has more options for viewing."
"4126","The technology worked, but I was surprised to find that when I searched for videos using the Fire TV stick, I got different results than when I searched on my Kindle - there seemed to be more on the Kindle, particularly in the category I look at the most - old silent films.Also, there appears to be a restriction on network passwords - they need to be at least 8 characters, so I had to reset my network password in order to get this to work."
"4127","You really don't want me to review this. I know new things take awhile to learn. But so far I hate it. My husband is more techy than I am and he likes movies. So he will figure it out. We were trying to save money. Satellite is so expensive. But I like Cubs baseball, NCAA basketball, local news, wheel of fortune. None of which I can find. In fall I will want college and pro football. So far it is frustrating. I don't like it. But I am 59. So it's hard"
"4128","Bought to get access to YouTube after YouTube disabled the app on my Vizio TV.  The YouTube app on the Fire TV Stick is vastly superior to what was on the Vizio."
"4129","Very nice improvement over the older version, it is much faster and the voice application works wonderfully.  The price makes it even better."
"4130","I tried out the Roku streaming device first and it was terrible.  The first one I bought turned everything green and the user interface was not friendly at all, so I bought a second which did the exact same thing.  I returned them both and tried the Fire Stick and it is awesome.  We ended up getting a second one for our room.  It's very easy to use and the Alexa feature is pretty cool.  The user interface is much more intuitive and the picture is great.  Happy customer :)"
"4131","NOT HAVING ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE, IT TOOK AWHILE TO UNDERSTAND, ETC.  I GOT FRUSTRATED WITH SO MUCH STUFF YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR, BUT I MOVE ON.  I AM CURRENTLY A VERIZON DSL CUSTOMER ( WE DON'T HAVE FIOS IN MY AREA) WHICH IN THE HIGH SPEED STREAMING WORLD IS LIKE HAVING 2 SOUP CANS AND A ROPE.  THE CUSTOMER NEEDS TO REALLY LOOK AT THE CAPABILITIES OF WHAT HE HAS AND HOW YOU WANT TO USE THE STICK. I PLAN ON ENHANCING, UPGRADING, WHAT I HAVE, THEN THIS WILL BE OKAY."
"4132","We are having such a great experience with our Fire TV Stick. It is easy to find great things to watch with the intuitive interface and voice search via Alexa on the remote. The big bonus we discovered is that 'good TV' lives on Amazon. The programs they produce are fantastic. If you are wondering why there is never anything good on television get Prime and a Fire Stick and you will never be short of great options. I hope they always maintain this caliber. It's fantastic."
"4133","Price is right and so very easy to install.  I love the Alexa voice remote.  I think I am in heaven!  I am so glad I made this purchase!!!"
"4134","Gave to my daughter and she loves it! Very easy to set up, loves the voice command feature, easy to take from living room TV to bedroom TV"
"4135","Great product.  Was very easy to set up quickly.  No problems here.  Had two issues; one was it would lose wi-fi connection now and then and it is only about 18 inches from my router and the second issue is when I speak to Alexa her response comes via my original Alexa and not through the TV speakers."
"4136","I was under a misconception when buying it.  I thought I could watch current tv programs instead of former episodes.Doing all the add-ons necessary is not only time consuming but very frustrating for me (an 81 yr old man.)  While I dolike the savings vs satellite tv, there is very much to learn about using this.  WGR"
"4137","I was very skeptical with this for the price but need something for spare bedroom and didn't want to run more cable and at this price, I figured I would try it. I am somewhat knowledgeable about electronics but was very surprised about how easy it was. Loaded a couple of apps and now we are extremely happy with the unit and ability to watch the various programs when we want to. Highly recommend if you are tired of running cable wires in your house and aren't concerned about the local news"
"4138","I love it! Very easy to use and also set up. The set by set guide was really easy to set up. I got this as a house warming gift and ready to buy a 2nd one ofr my other TV- this is great and everyone must own. I was looking into the Apply TV but this one seems to be much better for sure :)"
"4139","Haven't stopped playing around with my fire stick yet! Best decision thus far and I have the Apple TV and the roku and they don't compare. If you are in the market and not sure which one to get, I say hands down save some money and get the Fire stick. You won't be disappointed"
"4140","Smooth operation.  No lag.  Finally cut the cord and cancelled all CONCAST services and signed up for sling.  Perfect little remote sure helps too."
"4141","Really like my firestick... just wish I didn't have to pay extra for so much...but I'm still very happy with it. Probably even more so when I figure it totally out."
"4142","It helped me to get rid of my cable outrageous bill I was getting every month I love my firestick I also purchased last year for friends and family as Christmas gifts"
"4143","The fire stick is awesome. I love it. Now I can watch endless tv whenever I want. Amazing! And Alexa is mad smart when she cooperates lol."
"4144","I bought this for my 87 year old Dad, who has a smart tv but could not get some sports channels to stream. I loaded up the aps he wanted at my house and then took the fire stick to him. It works great! The only trouble is ""Alexa"" doesn't always understand him and sometime he struggles to hold the button and speak to ""her"", other than that it has been a well worth it investment and did everything we wanted it to do!"
"4145","Great device. Does what it needs, how it needs to do it. However, everytime I use it I can't help but think I should have sprang for the Fire TV instead of the TV stick. When goes through the menus it seems just a tad bit slow (about a millisecond or so, enough to make it feel not ""smooth"") and there are no usb ports for me to plug a keyboard or other things to. The fire tv looks like it would solve both of these problems."
"4146","I've only just set it up but already I love this and plan to replace my apple tv in my front room with this as well.  So user friendly!!"
"4147","I asked where my watchlist was located and it was totally confused.I found it but I was looking too deep into the menus.. probably a dumb question, but it could not help me.."
"4148","Love this darn thing !!!! However the remote broke for no reason. Will change review if amazon replaces my remote ... only had this for 3 months"
"4149","Easy setup with enclosed instructionsOnly problem so far I think has to do with the WiFiIt gets cutting off what I’m watching and I have toRequest to get back to Netflix"
"4150","Just recently received the unit. Still getting used to it's operation. However find it to be useful and entertaining.  Will share opinions with others as I use fire stick and  become more aware of it's use and potential."
"4151","The item was packaged nicely without any damage or defect. The install was very user friendly and I loved the style and look of the remote. The detailed description matched the product exactly. This item will make you become a couch potato based on the large inventory of viewing pleasure."
"4152","There was a learning curve involved, but I a, hanging with it. I finally realized that having so few buttons to push was a help. I just have to learn which buttons to push when. I am older and my vision is not always clear. Seeing the little words on my TV is often hard for me. Especially with the TV in my bedroom where I like to remove my glasses. Being able to speak my preferences is such a huge help to me. I now have a total of 4 remotes next to my bed. Whoo! I am so techy!"
"4153","The Fire Stick with Alexa Voice Remote couldn't be any better if it was Alexa Davalos herself from The Man in the High Castle, which the Fire Stick has enable me to watch! I live in a remote area with terrible television reception and the Fire Stick from Amazon has opened a new world of programing and shows for me and my family! I wish I had purchased this device 2 years ago! Thank you for a wonderful product. More than wonderful, it is amazing, too!"
"4154","For the past few years I had been using a chromecast device, but once I received my firestick there was no turning back. The list of apps are ongoing and I have access to so many different platforms to watch movies, shows, live streaming and games from, that I don't need anything else...except for unlimited Wi-Fi!"
"4155","I would DIE without my firestick.Easy to use, and easy to transfer to other tvs around the house.Perfect for kids room as well"
"4156","Works great. Really haven't used the voice controls. Haven't used it for a lot. It honestly set in a box for 6 months because my tvs have apps for Netflix Hulu Amazon etc. So honestly if that's what you are getting it for make sure your tv doesn't already have those features. i use it on a tv that doesn't have those apps though and it works great. Very fast connection time. It takes a few minutes for my other tvs to connect to the network. The fire stick is much quicker."
"4157","The Fire Stick is very easy to install and provides everything that is promised. It does sometimes have a hick-up in the middle of streaming, but it is shorter than a second and does not happen often. The only thing I don't like is that when scrolling through the watchlist one cannot see which movies are  Prime and which ones not. It would be great if there was the ""prime banner"" as it is on the website. All together it is an awesome device for such little money."
"4158","So far I love it except for one thing. I have all of the premium channels though my TV provider but Amazon Fire TV does not support my TV provider so I can't use any of the apps to watch shows since you have to login to everything or pay. Seriously disappointed! I had an Apple TV and was able to login to everything on that. Otherwise I like it way better than the Apple TV. Just sucks I can only use it for Netflix basically or pay even more money for TV I already pay for."
"4159","This is our second Fire TV stick in our home.  We also have the Amazon Fire TV streaming media player for HD viewing capabilities on our main TV. The Fire TV stick is perfect for our secondary TVs and for travel. Our kids stream their favorite YouTube channels, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I love buying digital movies through Amazon and being able to watch them on each of my TVs  without having another component to deal is awesome without the chance of a damaged movie disc."
"4160","I used this to give a second life to my old 1080p bedroom TV. I was using a Chromecast before but hated having to mess around with my phone to ""cast"" things.The Fire TV stick comes with a remote and an actual user interface with menus. It's extremely convenient to select what to watch directly from the TV.The hardware specs of the new Fire TV stick are amazing - especially for the price. This little thing is super snappy, packs a quad core CPU and comes with 5GHz 802.11ac Wifi. The only thing that comes close is perhaps the Roku Streaming Stick (3600R) (2016 Model), however the Roku only has the slower 2.4GHz wifi and is more expensive.I use this for Amazon Instant Video, Netflix and Plex. Plex has no problem direct playing most 1080p videos I throw at it without buffering.The other feature I really like is you can connect bluetooth headphones. This is great especially for a bedroom TV."
"4161","Nice streaming device. For amazon movies and such. Useful if you have a good Wi-Fi router. Could use improvements in streaming Netflix."
"4162","My only complaint is the there doesn't seem to be anywhere for close captioning. They have a subtitles button, but NO close captioning."
"4163","Still learning to operate it however so far I like it, watched many movies already because I am a Amazon Prime member, music is awesome"
"4164","I currently have two love them. Shows are great. Easy to take with you. Nice carry package for travel. Love it! Plan on getting 2 more."
"4165","I love the updated Fire Stick! The remote is a little bigger and I am no longer afraid that I will lose it. The first generation remote was very small. The added addition of Alexa is a plus too!"
"4166","Very slow loading. It does not let me go back to the last episode I was on. I have to remember where I was and go though and find it. It does not start back up on where u left off in a episode. Except for the Alexa voice part I like Roku better."
"4167","Great streaming device ! Also very easy to add Kodi and watch everything possible ! I pack it away and take it with me on work travel ."
"4168","So much better than even the most recent Roku. I guess something to do with the direct connectivity, but even our picture looks better.s"
"4169","Easy to install and converted our old, plain television into a smart TV. We love being able to get Netflix like the younger generation."
"4170","works very well. had it since December. having difficulty finding my watch list on Amazon Prime.....also its usefulness continues to improve with continued ""trial & error"" experience. recognized nearly all our voice commands too"
"4171","Love IT!  Set up was super simple.  Love using the voice feature.  Living with Alexa, Dot and now Fire TV Stick well, the power of voice command has gone to my head!  My TV is 4 1/2 years old so accessing the Prime movies and shows was clunky.  Now, it's so incredibly easy with the Stick.  My TV watching was only 4 or 5 hours a week, now it's gone way up and I've rediscovered how comfortable my couch is.  Thinking of ordering another Stick for the TV that's in front of my exercise bike!"
"4172","Works great until it doesn’t. Usually mid way through a great part of a game we’re watching, or the best part of a movie. I have to restart the stick sometimes multiple times a day. Very disappointed as we had the highest of hopes to use this to cut the cable cord."
"4173","Awesome!!! My only complaint is had bought the stick mostly for my mom whom is blind.  Although Alexa can help she doesn't completely open an app or show... for instance I would like Alexa to help my mom play her shoes on netflex or Hulu instead she redirects me to amazon where sometimes I have to buy.  Maybe program an option forAlex to be moreAssistive with the visually impaired person thanks!! Overall great product"
"4174","Great device.  Fast loading, smooth, neat layout.  Love this. Far superior to my Roku devices. I own two of these Firesticks and they make Roku  appear to be years behind in technology. It should also be known that the Roku boxes I have are poorly constructed.  I've had to replace two aleady due to power port issues. So, if you're interested in streaming,  Amazon Firestick is the way to go!!!"
"4175","I was expecting a little bit more, I thought you can watch regular TV show I gave up my cable box, but it'll do for right now to something else come out better."
"4176","Easy to install, easy to use. Needs directions in the package that include description of key functions. Alexa doesn't work very well at all."
"4177","Outstanding Transaction - Super Fast Delivery - Excellent Product - Highly Recommend A++++ / best add-on product for media viewing ever"
"4178","Works great. Easier than firing up my PS4 to stream.Fast, intuitive, and Alexa voice remote is great. Very happy with the purchase, should've done it sooner. I should've got the box, however because I have a 4K TV. Likely will replace this with it soon and move stick to my bedroom."
"4179","Perfect addition to make your TV Smart. The Alexa voice command is a GREAT feature. Simple to set up and use. Highly recommend. Better than ROKU."
"4180","Love it... obviously a high quality product for such a little gizmo.  Super easy to get it up and running, and the Alexa remote deal is pretty cool too considering I wasn't really aware it even came with it when I purchased it."
"4181","I do like that I can finally get Netflix on  h large tv but in that process i can no longer get it on my Fox fire tablet.I really did like having Netflix on this tab so easy to take anywhere. I am thinking of having my son take it off my tv so I will be able to have it on this Fox fire tab.every time I have tried to connect Netflix to the tab it says cannot."
"4182","We got rid of our cable and our TV wasn't a smart TV so this changed everything for us. I can watch all our favorite shows without a crazy cable bill."
"4183","The Fire Stick with Alexa Voice Remote is wonderful.  Now all I have to do is hold the intercom button and ask Alexa to find a certain movie or music, and like magic its there."
"4184","I have had Fire TV Stick for a few months now, it works great! I have both Direct Tv and Firestick. Believe it or not I spend more time on Firestick than I do on Direct TV.The only down side is you waste alot of time surfing."
"4185","While I appreciate Alexa I would prefer the remote to have actual numbers, volume control, maybe even a power button.  You know, something that actually functions like a remote control for a TV. Considering this device helps the masses ""fire""their local cable or satellite provider, a more familiar remote would help people with their transition into TV viewership freedom. And this is coming from a person who's VCR never stopped blinking 00:00"
"4186","Needs more apps  such  as vudu or fandango now. Also I wish it could cast to TV screen like chromecast. Firestick does have apps, but they are weak. More android and other apps support casting to Chromecast. I do like that it Firestick does have netflix. Chromecast does not support Amazon  prim and support an android app. I especially like the remote.  I also would only give Chromecast 3 stars. I wish that the two companies could get together and standardize the market."
"4187","I like the price and being able to get rid of cable. It works well and doesn't spend time buffering. Downfall is the fast forward and rewind is slow, doesn't show the seconds on the bottom so you know ho far to went. Also, when watching an episode of a show on HBO it doesn't take you back to where you left off in the season, you have to remember for next time or else you end up searching for which episode you left off on. The Netflix and Hulu don't have that same issue."
"4188","I'm super impressed! Thinking of kicking my cable company to the curb! :) I thought you could only view Amazon content but I was wrong!!!"
"4189","I've never owned a fire stick this is my first and I absolutely love it! I love all the different selections of tv and movies as well as the apps you can download it's amazing"
"4190","This works great with my TV and internet. I just cut the cord from Directv and am very happy with the Amazon Fire Stick. I purchased 2 more for my other TV's. I should have done this a long time ago."
"4191","Overall works great. Good performance and works great at hotel with extra screen to accept terms and conditions for wifi usage. However, I was disappointed to find that you cannot add the Vudu or FandangoNow apps. I realize these are competitors but realistically most people use multiple services for online movies so it would be nice if a streaming device allowed you to access all of them (like the Roku does)."
"4192","Love it: color is great, I can listen to my music, watch movies with no commercials. still in the learning process as to what I can do with my fire tvstick."
"4193","great product - bought a couple of these for installing Kodi - works wonderfully using Kodi and also Amazon Prime - this is a dependable product - awesome!"
"4194","Works grea! If you are having any connectivity problems during install try rebooting the router. The device had problems connecting with Amazon.com, but after I rebooted my router i have  had zero problems. Would recommend this to everyone."
"4195","This newer version of the fire tv stick works really good, no problems so far? Its a lot faster than the old version of fire tv stick. Its quicker and faster when in operation. I'm happy with this product. I'm going to give it 5 stars."
"4196","Very easy to use, very easy to set up.  My first 'fire' product and so var I like it very much, my poor chromecast is sitting next to the tv unplugged now.  Typing can be tedious but I don't expect much more from just a remote control."
"4197","It works well, the only problems I had were:  It won't come out of sleep mode sometimes and I have to turn it off then back on.  When i lost my internet connection, it would not power up for a couple of hours.  Just had a black screen."
"4198","Took us awhile to finally give in and purchase. We have always had a Google Chrome Cast and we love this so much better. Can search by voice and easier access to Netflix and Amazon Prime shows."
"4199","So glad I upgraded, I love the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote. It works great & is very easy to use, this is going to spoil me!"
"4200","Simply amazing. These firesticks not only are easy to use by has saved us ALOT of money as well. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
"4201","Purchased this as a gift for a friend and they love it. Set up was easy and they enjoy the entertainment value.Voice remote is a plus!"
"4202","Just upgraded from original firestorm without voice commands and couldn't be happier.  Adds so much more flexibility to its usability."
"4203","I own so many of these.  I do like Amazon TV better since it can directly plug into the Internet but these work for other rooms great."
"4204","I love that I don't have to point the controller at the television for it to work.  It is user friendly for those of us who do not want to ""learn"" another technology tool. LOL"
"4205","Works great in making my television a smart tv, a lot easier than trying to hook up through a gaming system.  Fast and easy to install"
"4206","One went bad and was replaced under warranty. The first replacement was immediately bad (not working). The second replacement is fine."
"4207","This is my second Firestick.  They are awesome. I tried a Roku express but it would not run the SlingPlayer app. This Firestick does.  The remote with a little bit of practice is easy to use.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that Alexa is not really that smart. She often doesn't know or miss spells words. She is kinda frustrating. They really really need to enhance her programming."
"4208","Very fast and easy to set up.  I use mostly to access YouTube and Amazon Prime.  I can get to all of my Prime Music albums so it's convenient"
"4209","It does what it is supposed to, works just great. now the parental control is not that great, if it is set, every time you want to watch Hulu or just about any other app it will ask for the pin after a couple of times it gets old. it should require the pin only for the purchase of shows, not everything but hey it is what it is"
"4210","Was delivered very quickly! It was pretty much plug and go. We cut the cable recently, so this is one of our main sources of entertainment. There's tons of programming for the whole family and was pretty easy to add the stuff we wanted. My only con is that you have to run power to it, but other than that, very pleased with it."
"4211","I have half a mind to return this as faulty. I also have the old fire TV stick and I am very happy with it. However this one made so much trouble since day one. I experience speed issues when there is nothing wrong with other devices. The only apps performing OK are Amazon video and Netflix. Any other streaming app I tried is practically unusable. My biggest issue is HBONOW won't even launch. I did everything including a factory reset but it still doesn't work even for a second."
"4212","Definitely one of the best purchases I've made. As long as there is internet the fire stick is there. We used this when went on vacation and it worked wonders with our toddler. He was able to watch his show and the adults were able to watch what they wanted. Definitely glad that I made his purchase."
"4213","So far we love it!! Get access to lots and lots of different channels, shows, etc. Will be cancelling Directv when our contract ends!!"
"4214","Very surprised at how easy it is to setup and use.  I have a Prime account and viewing movies is so easy.... Especially using Alexa...  This is definitely an welcome addition paving my way to an Alexa based smart home. Will definitely suggest to all of my friends."
"4215","This is so great! I don't know why anyone would pay an extra $120 for Apple TV. This device does everything I need it to and more, and the price was amazing. I'm a really big TV watcher and I completely got rid of cable when I purchased this. I don't even miss it."
"4216","I am impressed. Out of 10 units I have had only 1 fail. It was replaced without question. Picture quality and performane is excellent."
"4217","So far, this stick is working great...as it should  My first one was sent to me by DirectvNow when I subscribed....it did not work.  It was supposed tobe free but never worked properly.  They told us if we had a problem we would have to see Amazon but, of course, you have no evidence of thestick being sent to me.  I am happy with the new one, love the streaming!"
"4218","I decided to get rid of cable so many of my friends and co-worker said try the fire TV stick you will not be disappointed. My friends were right; I only had it for an few days and I can not wait to get home from work and watch my fire stick. WHY? all those movies and TV shows that we pay for on cable it is FREE plus the fire stick also allowed you to catch-up on paid review network such as HBO, SHOWTIME etc.  So glad that I DON'T have a cable bill."
"4219","I LOVE this fire stick. We needed a streaming device to replace our PS4 which relocated to another room. This works amazingly and I LOVE the voice command feature built in to the remote. For those considering hooking into the back of an AV receiver, that is my configuration. Sound from the receiver and picture passes through to the TV flawlessly. No problems with the remote communicating with the Fire Stick either  (though it is buried behind my receiver in a cabinet)."
"4220","I already have 2 Amazon firestick sets for televisions at home.I ordered the newer version of the Amazon Fire stick with Alexa for Christmas and it is the best ever. I absolutely love it! I bought it for my Mother who has absolutely No tech skills but with the Alexa, Mom simply says what she wants and it appears.The ordering was simple, efficient, fast and friendly. Also the packaging was secure and in great condition when it arrives as scheduled.Thank you."
"4221","I was having trouble streaming WiFi video through my aged Sony BlueRay player.  The video would freeze while the audio continued to play.  I checked my WiFi speed (it was more than enough) and my internet speed (also more than enough).  I was baffled!  Finally decided it HAD to be the BlueRay player. I bought the Fire TV Stick.  Problem solved!  The only thing I am having trouble with is that I can't seem to get Alexa to recognize my voice commands. NOT a show stopper."
"4222","The Fire TV Stick with the voice remote was easy to plug in, set up, and start watching great shows immediately. The delivery came about a week earlier than it was originally scheduled. Downloading and installing apps is easy. I really like the Alexa voice remote although she does struggle at times with my very Southern Drawl. I really like the internet wi-fi setup that provides a much more reliable streaming  experience than the Samsungdevice I was using before."
"4223","Love it"
"4224","I bought this to watch ""Man in the High Castle"" on my basement HDTV instead of the computer.  Easy hookup and works perfectly."
"4225","I was a little disappointed because I thought it would be commercial free. It's a trial of Hulu & Netflix. So, we will see after trial is over if commercials stop. My friend has the Fire tv box. If the commercials don't stop, Iwill end up selling this to another friend & buying the box."
"4226","I am not sure why but when I ask to play some artist it tells me that it can't find the artist even though the artist is on Amazon music and for sale on the sites I wish it would like all the bands that I like so I can enjoy them with out having to search hard for the bands."
"4227","I love this!  I got rid of cable a few weeks ago.  With the HD antenna and the fire stick I can watch everything I was watching when I had cable.  It is super to set up.  I love how I can press the button and turn on any show."
"4228","Wow finally a product that not only give me what I'm looking for in streaming😊 And it was very simple th set up. Well worth the wait and price."
"4229","Purchased Amazon prime along with the stick for a total of $140 out of pocket. Added stars for $12 per month & Netflix for another $8That's a total of $20 per month of more tv than I can watch, add to that the fact I can order anything in my house from toilet paper to groceries or medical devices & they are at my front door in 2 days free shipping it's the best deal I've ever come across in my lifetime."
"4230","Not a bad device for the price. But now just one year after purchasing the device seems to be malfunctioning more often.Easy to install and get started."
"4231","So much better than my Roku! My Roku all of a sudden decided it was a good idea to make painful screeching noises while playing anything.So happy I got this instead of a new Roku"
"4232","This is the best thing I've ever bought, love love love it. I'm handicapped and this is wonderful, if your thinking about getting it stop thinking and get it.  Very easy to install I'm 73 and did it with no helo at all"
"4233","This is my 2nd fire stick! I have had a fire stick for over a year and it still works perfectly!!! I'm getting a second one for a second tv in the house because we are always using it!!! Zero complaints all will love!!"
"4234","Bought my second one. I wish they sold an accessory to make the HDMI dongle longer. Needs a 2-3 foot long extender for when you have a weird TV in a room that has a port that's hard to access in the middle of the back."
"4235","tried to love it. really wanted to love it. didn't love it.sent it home to the mothership. i'm sure it will be perfect for somebody that's not me."
"4236","Love my fire stick and it came in a lot sooner than expected even though it was on backorder. Thinking of getting another one for our living room."
"4237","Great product! Only issue we've had is the with the 5 gHZ band it's a little flaky. Sometimes requires restarting it to get it to work. Otherwise it works great."
"4238","Cut the Cable TV cord and save every month; but in my opinion spend the extra money and get the Fire TV Box!  The stick is slower and laggy compared to the FIre Box, plus it doesn't have an SD micro port."
"4239","Not as good as the Fire TV and it also freezes up and you have to unplug it and wait and start over from the beginning.  Have not used it as much as the fire tv."
"4240","The Fire stick works well. Very easy to set up and extremely user friendly. Having Alexa voice activation makes everything even easier and more fun. I would definitely recommend this product. I'm very pleased."
"4241","Remote stopped working after the first day, and ive tried new batteries. The stick itself seems to work fine with an app you can download as the remote."
"4242","We are still learning the ins and outs of the Fire Stick but so far it's doing a great job with everything we wanted.  May five stars in a month's time."
"4243","The Fire TV Stick was our way of cutting the cable.  It and Playstation Vue does everything that we need and we are very happy with it."
"4244","I had bought this for a friend. He gave it back after 3 days said it didn't work. I received a replacement only to realize there was nothing wrong with it. So we have 3 now. Thank you"
"4245","Seems to work well, not as much space or processor power as the Fire TV.  At first I missed the HDMI extension cable and was frustrated at the poor fit it had on my Insgnia TV, but after finding the extension cable fit is not an issue.  But it does stick out on the side and is visible from the front; I guess a longer cable would let me put it behind the TV on the shelf.  Could be a nice portable solution for travel, have to see how it works with hotel captive portals."
"4246","I haven't used it enough yet to know, but it seems to work well enough to get the programs I want to see on Amazon.  It's not quite as smooth as our setup with Netflix on Apple TV, and requires a few more steps to get to the program, but at least it allows us to ""open the door"" to Amazon.I am not a lover of voice remotes--I don't even talk to my phone; but I guess its just part of another 'learning curve.'Denise KohnNew Albany, OH"
"4247","We love the speed and the ease of use of the fire stick! It doesn't overheat and has great qualities. The only thing we have issues with Alexa and the voice control. It is not the best with speed and getting us where we need to go. We were just hoping for more with this feature and to not have to press the button. I know there is an app you can download so perhaps that is better, but we haven't tried it yet.Overall, I say buy it! You won't be disappointed!"
"4248","I love my Fire TV Stick. It makes it so much easier to get around all my apps for my shows and movies! The Alexa remote to is great because I can just speak what I want to watch and it brings the options up for me instead of having to type in a search. The one thing I was disappointed in is that there is not a way to watch my Vudu app. I have over 2 hundred movies on that app and I cannot use my Fire Stick to watch them on. If they added this that would be so awesome."
"4249","Good product but, the remote it comes with leaves you no choice but to always have to use two remotes or purchase an additional remote such as a (sideclick) which I do recommend for simple things like turning the TV on/off a source button to switch from one HDMI to another. Volume & channel up & down plus, select which this remote should have come with automatically. Also it is so small  & smooth you can expect to constantly drop it or lol"" lose it..."
"4250","Love it and Alexa. Took some getting use to the system and I may invest in a Bluetooth keyboard but I like it. I have a Roku 3 and I must say, I like the fire sticks options better. The Roku makes me register my apps (with my tv provider information) over and over. I have not had that problem here. Also, I love all of the content I can watch through prime. The remote is small and slick and fits perfect in the hand but is easy to lose. I would defiantly recommend this."
"4251","The fire stick worked properly until about a month ago. The voice activation no longer works and once it froze for several hours. Without the voice activation it is a hassle to use. I want to have it replaced."
"4252","It let's me watch whatever I want on any TV in the house.I have three Firesticks around the house as a matter of fact...."
"4253","I'm so happy with my Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice!! Turning my non smart TV into a smart TV is Fabulous!! Great product and price!!"
"4254","Item arrived on 05/13 and STILL in the box.  Gonna wait until my brother can install, but I know I'm gonna love it.  THANKS AMAZON!!!"
"4255","Easy to use once you figure it out!  The device is excellent. The process in learning how to use it correctly needs more explanation."
"4256","Couldn't be happier! It works great and I can now watch what I want? Highly recommended this!It was the first thing an installer for my WiFi recommended."
"4257","I like it but not quite sure if I can give up my was a too expensive dish as of yet. There are some movies that I'd like to watch but you have to pay for. However,  if I do they would still be cheaper than dish in a month. Rated in the middle cause its new to me and right now I'm straddle the fence"
"4258","The Fire TV stick is exactly as advertised. Alexa has its limitations as expected since this is not the full sized Amazon Fire TV or the stand alone Alexa home assistant, but I'm very pleased with this purchase.I can say it doesn't seem to connect automatically to my bluetooth headset, but this is something that doesn't bother me. The only thing it requires is to access the settings and reconnect it, which it doesn't take more than a couple button pressing."
"4259","In a word: Kodi. Kodi saves. Get Kodi now. Fire stick is the key to Kodi. Alexa is touch and go, though... but Kodi. Watch everything."
"4260","Super easy to plug into your TV with tons of apps to stream movies and shows, everything from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, MyVudu and More! We ditched our cable, purchased two Fire Sticks and went strictly to streaming and are saving us $100/month! My 8 and 5 year old daughters are able to find the app and show they want to watch with ease."
"4261","this thing is freaking AWESOME!!  $40 for a voice activated remote and unit that allows me to access my prime, netflix, hulu, etc. accounts without having to attached a laptop or game console to the tv?  One of the best investments i have ever made in relation to video entertainment ..... no, not one of the best, THE BEST.  Works perfectly."
"4262","I like the ease in using the device, but I was hoping that I would be able to use the speech function to search with other apps also."
"4263","Love this! I actually haven't tried to use the voice command yet but I do use this every day and will probably drop my other service when my contract expires."
"4264","The Firestick with Alexa makes life more simpler. Instead of clicking back and forth to select your choice, you now can easily hold down one button and command Alexa to do what you want."
"4265","I absolutely love having this! I can cut my cable now because i don't need it with the fire stick. Its going to save me a lot of money."
"4266","It took a while to download and figure it out. Had to upgrade our WiFi service. We are using it, and it works fine. On time delivery."
"4267","Yes, it does. Do what it supposed and more. But the remote is easily breakable. Be careful about dropping it on the floor. It could cause it to stop working very easily."
"4268","I love my amazon fire stick! I bought one for my bedroom tv and I love having all of my tv/online streaming apps in one place. Makes things so much easier. Not having cable, it is very easy to watch what I want and can add more if I want. Would highly recommend getting one."
"4269","Cool product, but you need someone who really knows what they're doing to get it to make it work.  No problem just plugging it in BUT the app to make it really work takes a 'geek'!!"
"4270","More than met expectations! Although I received one as a gift, with five television sets in our home, I know this one will be used as well."
"4271","Easy to set up and offers a wide variety of things for the TV. Am enjoying it more than I thought I would. Would recommend to others!"
"4272","Bought this for my husband to use on trips away from home and he loves it! Its like bringing a piece of home with you wherever you go."
"4273","Low budget but it does what u want it to do if your choosing a android box.  Amazon TV box is much better for 90 bucks though. The Amazon stick at 40.00 is not as powerful, but gets the job done. I love them both. For my personal I choose to use the Amazon TV Box over the Amazon TV Stick. Can’t loose with both."
"4274","I switch from a chromecast to the fire stick.  I like the fact that it comes with a remote instead of having to stream from my phone."
"4275","Never thought I would enjoy this Fire stick I love it. I was able to catch up on some of my Cosby shows from the beginning wonderful!"
"4276","Wouldn't work with my TV!  Roku stick and Chromecast works perfectly fine, and Amazon even sent me another stick thinking that there was a defect with the original one.  The picture quality and set up was awesome and amazing, but no sound would come out (and I spent about an hour troubleshooting myself, then another hour on the phone with tech support doing the same thing).  No idea why it wasn't compatible with my TV still :("
"4277","Absolutely love it! We were able to completely cut the cable cord and opted for streaming services such as Sling, Netflix, and Amazon prime video instead, saving us almost $100 a year. This baby paid for itself within a month!"
"4278","EZ access to thousands of video and audio programs available from Amazon.  This is the latest model and works seamlessly with your HD TV and home WIFI.  Alexa's voice recognition is amazingly accurate and makes search and program choices a snap.  Works with hand-held Alexa Voice Remote (included) or free Fire TV Remote App (available for download on Fire, Android, and iOS) so that you can use your Kindle Fire HD, Android tablet/phone, or Apple device to access programing."
"4279","The Fire TV Stick is everything you can ask for it a compact package. It's easy to install and setup. If you already have an Amazon account, the Fire TV Stick is already registered. The Alexa Voice makes it easy for you to find what you're looking for."
"4280","We have had one for about a year has worked great. Got another one for another room. We have saved a lot $$ streaming this way instead of paying high cable rates. Worth it even planning to purchase one for  guest room"
"4281","I love this!! Recommend to everyone. Bought one. And immediately turned around and ordered two more awesome for the price. This Netflix, and Hulu live bypass cable all together."
"4282","Bought this for my husband as a gift.  Now that we have a new smart TV, we use this for the TV in another room.  Enjoying it very much."
"4283","Bought as gift for my mom during holiday season and kicking myself for not getting myself one....100000x faster than my year old roku that cost 3x this. My tech-challenged mom can manage the navigation thanks to ""Alexa""....even when I have to guide her through the phone. Think Roku is simple?  Nothing gets more simple than this!!!!! Sure I will end up purchasing one for myself at full price to replace my slow roku now that I've seen just how superior this is!"
"4284","I previously used my TV apps to manage my amazon videos, etc, but the fire stick is much, much better! Importantly it integrates well media from a number of apps in a very nice interface that looks as if Apple designed it. Well worth the money. I must say that I was not so impressed with the previous generation of the Fire TV Stick, but the current one is really wonderful, easy to connect, use, etc.One suggestion: combine it with a smart universal remote!"
"4285","I love Amazon products but this is not worth what they charge. The processing speed of this device is a joke! Despite a fast internet connection it takes roughly 45-60 seconds to load 1 selection (like up, down, select). I have powered down, restarted, unplugged and troubleshooted this device with absolutely no success or improvement at all. This much time and energy spent should be on a device that cost $10 not $40. What a disappointing product."
"4286","Awful! The roku is way better. I own 2 fire sticks and both remotes quit working. I've only owned this fire stick for 2 months. Look online, the remote is a big issue with these devices."
"4287","I received one for Christmas and loved it so much I purchased another one. It offers so many more viewing options. Very easy to set up. And also easy to program"
"4288","I've had one of the 1st gen firesticks and have to say I love the voice better. Very user friendly and easy to set up on TV that are not smart TV"
"4289","I like that Alexa will take me to the app I want. Will even find shows that I am looking for. Now if only I can get her to go to work for me....."
"4290","The Fire Stick works fine.  I've had trouble logging in with Netflix.  I wish there was a better way to log in than the current zipping around the grid looking for letter; if you misspell a word, you have to go back.  How about a ""voice print"" log on.  Just speak into the little remote to log in.  That would be nice."
"4291","i wish i didn't have to press the button down to here alexa but other than that - I LOVE THIS THING! so much better than apple tv too."
"4292","I love my Fire Stick. I have one for each of my TV's. Alexa does seem to have a problem understanding this girl from Brooklyn at times.I enjoy the streaming series and will use the programming to replace some of the cable junk on TV."
"4293","Cool device; takes a bit of work to get it going and understanding how it works, however there is enough information on YouTube to figure it out. Once set up, good to have and worth the money.  May even get another one for traveling."
"4294","I like it a lot.  Easy to install and configure.  Most popular applications are available, and in minutes you will be able to have tons of content.  I still haven't use the Voice Remote Control extensively, sometimes it doesn't catch the given command, but it works fine.  I'd probable get another."
"4295","Love the versatility and speed of this new fire stick, my only problem, I have had to restart it a few times when it froze up on me."
"4296","Works great! Was a little concerned about how well the voice search would work, but it recognized almost everything I spoke. Thinking about purchasing another for my parents."
"4297","I have cut out the cable and use antenna TV only.  This works great to watch so much media cable is no longer needed.  Comes in excellent and actually have a hard time deciding what to watch."
"4298","Just got this yesterday and took about 45 min to buy some apps on it and make some changes and once that was done started watching movies!"
"4299","This is Great!  The Fire TV Stick was so easy to set Up!  Piece of cake.  Very easy to use after I played with it a little bit.  The available streaming is huge.  I have not used Alexa Voice Remote as I don't have Alexa.  I would recommend to friends and family."
"4300","LOVE IT. Just opened it yesterday"
"4301","Love the variety of movies and television shows my family and I can watch!  Highly recommend and I am very happy with this purchase!"
"4302","After registering the product and trying it it didn't work so I took it back. I found my old one and it works well, I had moved and thought I lost my first one so (naturally found it) I bought a new one, and like I said I followed the directions and paired it with the router at my new place then registered the device and pressed ""home"" and nothing so I unplugged it and tried again and still nothing."
"4303","It seems to work fine, but......there are few instructions. Our biggest concern is how to identify what we can watch for free and what  programs will be added costs.We have used it very little as we installed it in the guest BR. If it is as we believe it to be, ( need more experience and information on use) we will not renew our current TV program contract and purchase two more Firesticks.George"
"4304","Still learning how to use it. Have enjoyed several movies. Now watching a series.It is a challenge as I am electronically challenged."
"4305","I really enjoy the different capabilities it has and the movie selection as well as other features, makes the Fire TV Stick a favorite of our family."
"4306","Sometimes this thing works and when that happens you might get a couple of hours before it goes off again......and again.......and again."
"4307","What it does is make any tv a smart tv. You have to download apps to watch anything. But this is still cheaper than cable. You can also purchase packages through direct tv so you can watch live TV still. I highly recommend this to anyone. It will save you so much money."
"4308","I already own 3 firesticks and a firetv and love them all! I purchased these 2 as gifts for Christmas and the recipients love them now too! We have totally canceled our tv service and live the content available. These are mighty devices in a tiny case. I highly recommend this product."
"4309","I wish I could like this but it stopped working after a few uses. We had it on one TV and the picture quality was horrible as well as the sound. It felt like we were watching a bootleg movie. So we moved it to our 60"" TV and got better sound and video results (chalking up the poor quality on the other TV as it just being incompatible). However, it has only worked a few times and now it stopped. We bought new batteries for it and changed the battery with no luck."
"4310","I bought this to replace an old Sony Blu Ray player that was getting slower and slower to connect. At first I thought this would basically be a replacement type item, but it is so much more. The speed is almost like changing a channel and the voice commands are great. I am still getting to know all the features but so far have been very pleased. I like the fact it will update on its own so it should constantly be improved and for the price it is definitely worth it."
"4311","So far I love my Fire TV Stick! It installed very easily and I was up and running in no time at all. I love all of the available shows through so many different apps! The voice remote seems to work perfectly, though I haven't had a lot of experience using it yet., I expect no issues. I'm seriously thinking about canceling my Dish Satellite subscription. It's too expensive for what you get. All I need is internet and I have all the great shows and movies that I want."
"4312","Exceeded my expectations. Great buy."
"4313","Works as advertised. The only thing I would change is the power cord is pretty short. I have 4 of these now. One for each tv in the house."
"4314","Awesome product. As advertised, good shipping time and item as described. After receiving the first one, ended up ordering a second."
"4315","Fire stick working great but sometimes loads slow...still getting it all figured out though. Definitely preferred over my Roku tv as far as apps go"
"4316","The talk function.... absolutely the best thing ever. ""Play Tom the Tow Truck"". She plays Tom the Tow Truck. My 3 year old uses it."
"4317","Easy to connect to video system, works well and the voice control is great!  I recommend this as a great addition to my video watching."
"4318","Great product...easy to connect and operate...even though I have a smart tv, the brand does not have all the apps...thanks to Fire tv, I have access and can eliminate cable"
"4319","Worked great but then heated up and stopped working about 4 mo's after purchase, right after warranty ended so I went to a local electronics store and had to buy another :("
"4320","Absolutely love the fire stick! Easy to watch tv and faster viewing with Alexa. I highly recommend adding this to your tv for easy viewing.. can even use your phone as remote !"
"4321","Love my fire stick!  I have a Roku and I use this much more often.  It just seems to work better.  Fast easy navigation and excellent video all through a little box plugged in to my TV."
"4322","Still only 3 days of use but very pleased so far, except for the remote control which works intermitenly. It freezes after a few minutes and one has to remove at least one battery and then it starts to function again. These happens every 3 to 5 minutes aproximately and it is kind of frustrating.¡"
"4323","All the reviews of this product with five star ratings were spot on! Absolutely love the Amazon Fire Stick, it so easy with very little set up time.  Works flawlessly right out the box, will truly recommend this to all my friends and family."
"4324","The firestick remote keeps freezing and pressing down on the home for 10-12 mins as recommended wasnt revolving the issue unless i remove and reinstall the batteries. I even replaced the batteries because i thought  the batteries that came with it were bad. The funny thing is that my Panasonic TV remote acts as a backup as it actually controls the app on my TV just like the firestick is meant to do. Weird!"
"4325","I like this product. Once all required signin information was at hand, it was easy to install. It is not easy to cancel subscription, if during the trial period you decide you want to cancel. Still haven't found it. So will most likely get charged for the effective month. Although trial periods are free, now I will be paying for something i will not be using until I can figure out the cancellation process."
"4326","I have not used the alexa ...truthfully not so much interested in it. I do enjoy the firestik and the prime movies. Tv has gotten boring.  Finding a good movie unless on cds is far and few on tv. It was pkged well and it came on time.  No complaints..."
"4327","Love it! Huge improvement on my old RCA streaming box. Alexa makes everything super easy. I don't know why I didn't buy one sooner!"
"4328","Worked perfectly on my LG tv. I set up Plex on one of my computers and can now share media from that computer to my tv. Works great"
"4329","For now I am giving a rating of 5 stars.  I am still learning but so far it has been well worth the cost and eliminating cable/dish"
"4330","Still working have had to disconnect and reconnect several times to get it to work and it also gets very hot when surfing You tube."
"4331","I've only been using this for about a week, and it's already revolutionized my television watching. It fantastic having all of my online and streaming options together in one place and for that one place to be on my television screen and not a tablet.  Turns out I do like binging after all, and not having to fast-forward through the commercials is much more of a benefit than I realized before.  The setup was incredibly easy and using it has been quite easy as well."
"4332","I love this fire tv stick! I will say that when using it you do need to be closer to the router and or modem for a better service. I have a fire tv box as well and it doesn't have to be as close to the router as the stick does. But the stick and the box both have all of the best apps for entertainment. With the Kodi app added to them (which you have to add or get someone to) you can watch anything anytime! We don't even have cable anymore. It is a real money saver!"
"4333","So much has already been said about the Fire Stick, so I'll keep it short.  I really enjoy the Fire Stick especially since I have chosen to get rid of my cable.  This allows me to do so.  The cost of the Fire Stick is less than one month of my cable.  I'm saving $600 a year!  I like it and would recommend it to anyone looking to do the same.  I have a hard time rating things 5 stars when there is always room for improvement.  Thus, I only like this, and not love it."
"4334","For some reason had a difficult time getting this to work on the main TV connected to Dish. Ended up activating it on a TV not connected to Dish then plugged it into the main TV and it worked great. The voice remote is nice. I wished I had thought about how many ports were on the TV first, ended up purchasing a pigtail with addition ports no more plugging and unplugging the  DVD player. What I really like about the fire stick it takes up no room, and its very portable."
"4335","Cut the cable...lots to see.  I just wish there were clear instructions about downloading stuff.Like all tech, it's learn as you go"
"4336","Yes, very easy to install. I don't use Alexa to speak of (pun intended). But, we just got it and am still exploring what we can do."
"4337","I'm in love with my Firestick I just love watching everything in one it's amazing how a firestick compare to Chromecast I choose firestick it has more futures and apps you can do.. But this is highly recommend purchase!  😝"
"4338","Blown away by this little device. So easy to install and use. Turned my regular HDTV into a Smart television. So much stuff that I had been missing out on watching. Who needs cable with a device like this? Wow!!!"
"4339","Glad this works with Alexa. Though, I couldn't get the voice remote to put the fire TV on ""sleep"" when I was done. Have to do it manually."
"4340","The Fire stick has absolutely made a difference with our ability to watch Acorn TV and Britbox Amazon channels. No more interruptions, pauses, etc. I highly recommend it. Very satisfied customer."
"4341","So far I love it. I was going to get a new television and a friend of mine told me about the fire stick that I didn't need to get a smart TV just get that and it's a lot cheaper! Thank you Amazon"
"4342","Returned this unit, it kept losing connection with remote control, and going into a hung-up mode. Required a power cycle reboot to restore it to ""operation"" Did not care for Amazon heavy front end choices. Might buy one at a later date, if they can make them reliable. Right now, considering TV Frog, more expensive but looks like a better choice."
"4343","I am in love with the new fire stick. Alexa is a bonus to an already stellar product. Eliminated the need for cable service and only use the firestick now. Got one for each tv"
"4344","Love the firestick. Great for binge watching or just watching a movie with a friend, loved one or alone.I have 2 of them one for the living room and one for the bedroom."
"4345","I was very happy with this product and I can now see why this is more popular than the Roku, Better looking Menu and easier to navigate.  The Voice Menu works better.  The only problem I had with this is that the batteries that come with the remote only lasted 1 day before I had to replace them."
"4346","This is the household's third Firestick.  There's absolutely nothing that can be said negative.  It works great and as expected.  This is both the future and present day TV experience."
"4347","New software or what, I don't know, but the system seemed to glitch and require a reboot rather frequently.  You all know it: it gives you the refresh symbol and then says your network is down....which it isn't of course.  I actually returned this and am using an older version (which sometimes has the same issue, but way less frequently).Amazon is generally great, but continued problems like this when using Netflix (and even Amazon Prime) are annoying."
"4348","I recieved a free Fire TV Stick with a one month subscription to Directv Now. I love the Fire TV stick so much that I decided to purchase another one from amazon. I have 3 Roku Devices but I love the ease of the Fire TV stick and CBS plays much better on the Fire TV stick. The FireTV Stick makes me feel like I still have satellite TV. I canceled my satellite TV after getting the Fire TV stick and I don't miss satellite TV at all. I would definitely recommend this."
"4349","The Amazon fire stick is AWESOME! It's great being able to stream all of my shows in one location and now I can watch everything! I can't recommend it enough."
"4350","Love it  plug it in and start watching.  I would recommend the Fire Stick to friends and family. So far Alexa works better that Siri"
"4351","It cannot replace cable TV because almost EVERYTHING to watch is at an extra cost. Smart TVs and a chromecasts work alike. Not impressed"
"4352","I am really impressed with the new fire stick. After a two weeks using the fire stick, I just cancelled my cable (TV package), and an using an internet only package with my Fire Stick, a smart tv (with Amazon Video), and an Apple TV (with Amazon Video). I highly recommend this product to anyone who is interested in saving money on their cable bill, and having a reliable way to watch TV. I am going to order a second to replace my Apple TV soon."
"4353","Enjoy it.  I like that i dont have to type in and search. I can get weather! U can just ask Alexa find any movie or music, only reason i didnt give 5 star because at least once a day it says no signal but comes right back in within 10sec."
"4354","I love this litte Fire TV stick! It's so portable and easy to use. I have not utilized all of its features yet as I'm a pretty simple user (Hulu and Amazon Prime TV) but it definitely does what it says. It hasn't cut out and streams effectively. I have a Roku 3, but it is a pain to move from tv to tv around the house as I would like to so I spent a lot of time deciding between the Fire TV stick and the Roku stick. I chose the Fire TV stick as I am an avid Amazon person and also because of the added Alexa Voice Remote feature. I felt it was a good combo and the reviews are all great for the stick and the price is great for such a neat little gadget."
"4355","I am appaulled at the fact i was just setting up my firetv stick and i 1 clicked $99 dollars away? Absolutely no confirmation? Really? Wtf am i in bizzarro world here? Typed my email to sync my account and hit sign up for prime and instantly i had spent $99 UsD using the information from my online shopping account. That is what is legally called ""theft by deception"" here in OH. I cant even believe amazon practices this. Im stunned, shocked, & in total disbelief that my goto shopping site betrayed me. This is so very unacceptable that i cant express it in words. I feel like i got mugged in the streets of NY. seriously FU amazon. Dont ever link my shopping to any product again. Thanks"
"4356","I use Sling TV and Amazon Prime. This works perfectly with both, and Alexa is a bonus. Now you can order merchandise through Alexa on TV, fantastic - but dangerous :)!"
"4357","Remote Very Easy to use, just a few basic buttons.  The Alexa Voice Remote works PERFECTLY and is a great addition to the remote.  Would purchase this item again if needed. A+++++"
"4358","I love being able to watch movies, TV programs, and listen to music without any commercial interruptions. I cut the cord and get local TV stations with an over the air TV antenna."
"4359","Easy to set up, easy to use. Alexa works mostly great. Large variety of installed apps.Price was right...Love my Fire Stick!"
"4360","When cable fails us (and it all-to-often does) we turn to our Fire Stick. It rarely disappoints. The only drawback I've found is that Amazon fails to include a ""manual"" that helps unlock the services beyond the main menu. If you're new to streaming, that would be a BIG help."
"4361","All it does is just pull up subscriptions for you to buy in the world are you going to get rid of cable like this just to talk to your remote you're not want to going to get over it cable with this stick you can only just talk to it and it go where you already paying for you still going to have to have cable"
"4362","I love it. I am still playing with it. So far it exceeds my expectations. The batteries they sent me were dead. As soon as I put in live batteries it came to life. Make sure you are a prime member. Totally worth it. So easy to set up. Two great shows to start with. SNEAKY PETE AND THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE."
"4363","Channels were difficult to find and I still need to subscribe to premier services to see the best movies. The channels buffer way too much.  I would get an error message on the local channels saying the channel is not available at this time.  I wanted to return it but the packaging had already been discarded"
"4364","User friendly. We have the Sony Blue Ray, a Roku and not the Fire Stick. The Fire Stick is by far the best choice out of the three"
"4365","At first it was kind of hard to get used to the layout of the fire stick. But now that I am used to it I love using this device. I plugged it into my bedroom TV and all I had to do was enter in my Wi-Fi information and boom I had TV. I liked it so much that I ordered another one to give to Dad for Christmas. He's so behind on his technology that he needed a media player for his 4K TV which she had nothing to plug into it. Can't wait to see how he likes this device."
"4366","Noticeably faster performance. Worth the upgrade. I have the original one as well. Great device, great price, concealed behind tv."
"4367","Side-loaded with Kodi, this may be both the Roku and Netflix killer. After hearing many people sing it's praises, I finally got one. Now I can't get my husband off the couch, and if the selection and convenience of it remains steady, we may ditch Netflix the way we ditched cable so many years ago."
"4368","Very easy installation (if you call plugging it in installation).  Great way to use all my benefits of Prime Membership.  Never should have waited so long."
"4369","It works really well! However, I'm disappointed with how few of the things I want to see are actually available with Prime membership"
"4370","Works as advertized. Used for (in order of most to least use):1. DirecTV Now2. Netflix3. Amazon Prime streaming.Absolutely ZERO buffering or hiccups. Works flawlessly. I could not be happier with it.My environment for comparison:- Charter Spectrum 65mb cable internet service (Metro Atlanta market)- Arris SB6183 Cable Modem- TP-Link AC1900 Wireless router- FireTV stick v2 connected to the BGN side of the router."
"4371","Love being able to jump quickly from app to app with the voice remote. Mostly use this for Daily Burn and movies/tv shows. Works great for all of that! Interested to see what other features it has that we haven't explored."
"4372","Great Product!  We have Samsung smart tvs but the apps are not worth a hoot.  They can not be updated so we bought this firestick to replace that part of the tv.  Only troubles is the Alexa part, seems it doesn't understand or compute someone is talking to the remote.  We also have Roku on another tv and they are close.  Firestick is a better interface and ease of use!"
"4373","Helped us cut the cord finally. Remote has acted up a few times, won't recognize us hitting the keys but that's it. Great product."
"4374","Was hesitant to add another remote. Glad we did it's been great. Finally can use my prime benefits. Will get another for other tv."
"4375","The set up was easy. Shipping was fast. The sleekness of imaging is perfect. I just love this thing. We had been having trouble with our built in Wi-Fi Blu-ray player and even went to get another one and still did the same thing, which was constant buffering even when no one was connected to the Wi-Fi via smartphone. The extender it comes with definitely heightens the speed. I'm never going back!! <3"
"4376","Easy to hookup.  Arrived when expected. Works well.  Can now play movies on my TV even though the TV is not on the supported list."
"4377","I didn't realize I had so many items to choose from until I got my Fire TVStick with Alexa Voice Remote.  Thank you.  Carol Becker"
"4378","Had not realized I could use this to stream from my media server. Wow. Really great  and a cheaper solution than using WDTV boxes."
"4379","My biggest complaint is the difficulty finding movies to watch.  I don't know what channels carry movies or how to search titles anywhere.  It's all very confusing and frustrating.  However, once I find something to watch, the delivery is excellent."
"4380","I have recently decided to cut my cable, and I figured that this device is one of my best ways to that. After having it for about a week I am sad I did not buy one sooner.I was super easy to setup, very user friendly in navigating all over the place and downloading apps.Not to mention extremely fast with my current internet speed I have.I strongly recommend this the Fire stick and will probably be picking a couple more up in the very near future."
"4381","I cancelled my satellite TV. I ordered Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa voice and love it. I added Hulu and Netflix. I have more options and access to more TV at half the price."
"4382","When I first installed my firestick I could net get Hulu and although I reached out to customer service they were not helpful and so I posted a negative review.  Patrick C emailed me and asked me to call and I spoke to Josie who has totally fixed the problem and I now have a fully functioning Hulu app.  Thank you for resolving this matter for me in a timely manner.  Now, for the review - I just love the firestick and will now definitely recommend it to my friends."
"4383","I just replaced my Chromecast device with the Fire TV Stick; the convenience of not having to use an additional Android device and deal with the multiple clicks (often unreliable) before you get to cast, this one is just fast to get going. Best way to convert your TV to a smart TV. I haven't tried the voice activation much; based on a couple of attempts, it didn't seem as sharp in its listening skills as the Alexa; but I will reserve judgment until I use it more."
"4384","It seems like a fine product thus far, though I am so used to Roku that navigating is a newbie for me. My only complaint is that sometimes the remote just won't respond. Twice I've had to unplug it just to be able to get it operational again. This was a freebie due to signing up with DirecTV Now, but I'm more impressed by the Fire Stick than I am by DTVN, though they offer one channel that I really want, otherwise Sling TV is a better and more economical product."
"4385","This is so easy had and fun that I had to have more than 1. I never thought I could get with the streaming but now I can't live without."
"4386","Xbox and Google home have the ability 2 use voice search on tv programs in netflix without pressing a button. Why didn't Amazon make it possible for people to use their Echo Dot to voice search shows on Netflix instead of using this cheesy fire TV remote where u have to press the voice button. Amazon if u are reading this then please answer the feedback and Make echo dot control of fire tv possible or your competitors are eventually going to win on voice control"
"4387","I absolutely love this! Takes up no space and so portable. My only disappointment is I can't get a Vudu app to play my digital movies. I wonder if they will ever update the apps available to include more like Vudu."
"4388","This was very easy to set up - less than 5 mins. I have more access to features than my ""smart tv"" allows. Alexa works ok - I guess but i dont think the voice addition was really needed. The remote did give me some issues in the beginning but I eventually got it working. Never could figured out what the problem was, may have been a syncing issue. I really think they should add a light similar to regular tv remotes."
"4389","I love my Fire Stick. It was very easy to set up & I have even added apps.I love that I can watch so many things as an Amazon Prime member."
"4390","Does exactly what I want it to do and runs very fast. The Alexa remote can navigate you to anything as quickly as it takes to say a sentence. Very user friendly"
"4391","The Fire stick is a great idea, but the functionality isn't there. Most of my apps have lag and timeout issues. I have ensured it wasn't my internet by streaming the same channels and shows on different devices and they had no problem. I like how everything is in one place but it's frustrating to have to switch to my laptop because the stream has issues on my firestick. I personally would go with Roku if I was to buy a streaming device again."
"4392","We had our roku xs for years and were perfectly happy with it.  Got this as a present for my mother.  The interface was a bit more complicated seeming than the roku so i decided to do a switcheroo and keep it.  We are loving it.  I wish we could use starz app but thats my only complaint.  Love the voice control.  Love having prime video front and center.  It has everything i loved about our old roku and more.  Very worth the price and feels like significant upgrade."
"4393","This has been one of the best products that I've bought on Amazon. I use it every week and it performs very well. I'm really happy about this product and it's performance"
"4394","I am HOOKED ON Firestick, for ""obvious reasons""!!! ;) If want a simple to use Streaming Media Device for your Apps, then you ""Can`t Teach THAT""!!!!"
"4395","I really like the fire stick w/alexa. I have an older flat screen Sony and couldn't watch Netflix on it, now it's a delight. I also downloaded some apps to watch sports but a bit disappointed the regular NFL app wasn't an option. Just NFL Sunday Ticket that I don't subscribe to. Also if you're not a Prime member you will not be able to watch/use a lot of the features, so be careful npt to select Prime labeled features because they will activate and bill you as a new Prime member."
"4396","I've had two fire sticks - one I bought in 2015 and this one that I bought in 2017. I must say, the 2017 fire stick is much faster, and is on par with my Roku. I love it. The old one is good, but this one is much faster, less lag."
"4397","Easy to install and easy to use.  I resisted streaming service for years for fear it would be hard to use.  So far so good as far as ease of use.  My sister and I were able to install it quite easily."
"4398","Liked it more than I expected! It's a good solution for my second TV, have also used it in the RV when wifi is available. Don't really use Alexa that much but have been pleasantly surprised when I do."
"4399","For the price it can't be beat , just dissapointed in the content offered on it thought there would be more movies and TV offered with Prime. The fire stick is great and easy to set up. The remote is awesome. Just lacking in great content."
"4400","Love our new Fire Stick, I bought two of them and they work very well streaming content over a Time Warner Spectrum intranet connection. The only reason I didn't give 5-stars is that we sometimes encounter buffering that may be totally the fault of TWC but I also with the Fire Stick had more easily-navigated online help. Not everything is trouble shooting. I'd love instructional video."
"4401","Mother's Day gift from my daughter and I'm so pleased with it! I had secretly been admiring hers when I visited! I love my options!"
"4402","Easy hookup and sorry I didn't take advantage sooner. If you have prime, then why wouldn't you take advantage of this great add-on?"
"4403","Very unhappy with this fire stick! It freezes a lot even when I change the batteries. Been an amazon shopper for almost 15 years and never had a problem with anything I purchase until now!"
"4404","It's good, but not great unless voice command search works for other apps in the Fire Stick and not just for Prime Videos.I hope the next iteration of this has at least 32GB of space"
"4405","This has saved me so much money.  I would give 5 stars, but I do have an occasional freezing TV screen from the Fire Stick. I have to hold my power button and turn the tv back on as it freezes from the Fire Stick.  With that said, I have been able to cancel my satellite in all but 1 room, saving me $20/month. My kids love watching either Netflix or Prime shows and I love playing music when company comes over or when I am cleaning.  A must have if you are a Prime Member."
"4406","it works as expected!  :) now I have a secondary Fire TV in my bedroom. And actually I like it quite much than the Fire TV G1 I have in the living room."
"4407","My boyfriend has one and I was blown away by the sheer ease and available apps for this. Got mine on sale and I'm excited to get it. So much better than cable and less expensive!"
"4408","Exceeded my expectations. I have since cancelled my cable tv subscription. This device gives me many choices of movies, tv shows, news etc . I am very pleased with this purchase."
"4409","Wow, just wow.We do not have cable and we tend to watch Netflix and amazon and play music on Pandora. Used to use our computers hooked up to the TV to do this. that was very inconvenient.This Fire Stick is very intuitive, very simple, very convenient. And cheap! Some people might not care but I love this: when you leave the TV and have nothing playing, the Fire Stick has the most amazing photos as a ""screen saver."" This is five stars all the way."
"4410","I love it, I like it a lot better than the Roku stick, the remote helps out a lot and the voice activated Alexa is a added bonus."
"4411","Bought for my coach potato husband, and he loves it.  Maybe not the smartest thing I ever bought (lol).  Easy to install and use."
"4412","Am having issues even though my WiFi is in the next room. Internet provider claims it is not their fault when picture freezes up."
"4413","I love this product. I barely watch cable anymore. It's easy to use and I enjoy the variety of shows, movies and music available."
"4414","We have both a Fire stick and box. We love them both! Easy to use. Great for our grandkids too! We would recommend it to any one!"
"4415","Got one for each TV in my house, also as gifts for others.  Cut the cable and just use Netflix and Prime for my viewing pleasure!"
"4416","I love the Amazon TV Stick. Using Alexa is fun and streaming is great! I cut off all other TV companies so I save a lot of money."
"4417","Love this stick, watch all the latest movies with Kodi AND my 4 yr old & 5 yr old learn, so many educational apps and videos that actually interest them like none of the other things I've invested in to keep their attentionOnly deducted 1 star because sometimes Firetv stick tends to be sluggish and processing in the middle of using it but other than that we love it and recommend it to others"
"4418","i've had this product all of two days and I'm highly disappointed with the remote. It constantly stops working and I have to fiddle with the (brand new) batteries and....if I'm lucky....it will start working again. Had purchased the same product a couple months ago (bf took it when he up and moved out...) and had zero issues with it. Even the loading time seems to take longer with the ""new"" one."
"4419","How often do you get more for less?They updated it a bit and threw in the Voice search style remote.What used to be 50 bucks is now $39.99.Use the Firestick from TV to Tv in the house if you can't get more than one.You will need to buy an HDMI extension/extender,3 ft is fine.You are going to need another USB charger setup.We have several around the house so it was not an issue.If you have Tablets and Phones and whatever else you really need multiple charging setups anyway."
"4420","Faster than Roku but some options require separate subscriptions. I am told that this is jailbreakable but I have not tried that."
"4421","You need the remote, period! Alex in the remote is icing on the cake! skipping is now as natural as it should be!Youtube casting is finicky at times ( most of the times), I have to cast at least 2 times for the video to start playing! When I cast for the first time, the Youtube app opens up as expected and stays on the home screen, I had to disconnect and cast again for the specific video to play!. After the first connect, subsequent videos play just fine!"
"4422","I absolutely love my Amazon Fire Stick! I waited a while as I reviewed all my possibilities. My daughter & son-in-law use the Roku but I ultimately chose the Fire Stick. It was very easy to set up, it is easy to navigate (especially with the voice command) , and I have even decided to discontinue our movie channels within AT&T Uverse. I find all I need and more with Netflix & Amazon movies, so I am totally happy with my purchase. I would recommend it to anyone!!"
"4423","Installed Kodi and the family loves it. Set up was super easy. Just wish this could be a universal remote so I didn't have to use the Roku (tv) one *and* this one.Don't really use it for anything other than the Kodi apps, but I did feel this application (?) worked smoother than the Amazon app on my Roku tv.Decent prize when I think about not having to pay for cable.I do love how it searches by actor/director, etc. Pretty cool."
"4424","As much as we are loving our new Fire TV Sticks with Alexa Voice remotes, there are some issues that we are having to work out.  Because we have gotten rid of Dish and we are streaming through the Internet, there are some items that are just not available to us.  Sometimes, even purchasing a subscription through Amazon does not make available the program we were hoping to see!  But our Fire TV Sticks have been easy to figure out especially with the voice remote!"
"4425","My daughter gave me a fire stick for christmas, today is January 28 and the  remote control stopped working, I look in the package for some warranty, searched amazon and found nothing related to a warranty on the Firestick. This is the first time I am very disappointed with Amazon, I cannot find a way to get them to address my problem, the freaking remote control is DEAD,  is just a month old surely they would honor the 90 days warranty but is hard to find how."
"4426","I had Roku for quite a few years, and I have to say that the Firestick and the Fire t.v. box just blow it away...I wish I had bought these sooner."
"4427","We love our Fire Stick! It's so convenient and easy to watch tv, movies, play games, and even shop! Very happy with our purchase!"
"4428","The Amazon fire stick is just as good as the Amazon fire tv box aside from being able to play games and it's much less expensive."
"4429","buffering buffering buffering... my bluray player has netflix and amazon video also, uses wifi also and only 2.4gz channel compared to this that uses 5gz which is faster, yet my bluray player streams video much clearer without any buffering at all, both are in the same room and same location so distance is not the issue."
"4430","Works okay. Easy to install Kodi. Video quality is lacking. If I were to purchase another, it would have to be the $K media player."
"4431","We are enjoying the numerous and huge variety of viewing selections available.  Easy to install and use.  Reduced our current level of cable TV thus saving money while still enjoying all our favorite shows and movies."
"4432","We purchased our stick to watch Prime Video. We downloaded other apps too. Its great for all my entertainment needs. Its been great ,so easy to use and set up. Love that it has a remote.  I would recommend."
"4433","This low-cost stick has been far superior to all TV boxes I've used previously. The integration with Amazon Prime and IMDb (also Amazon owned) combined with features like X-Ray provide an experience that far outweighs the competition. Live TV apps like Playstation Vue are a bit sluggish but Amazon Prime Video and Netflix are super fast and the overall experience of the two combined with the stick's interface make it feasible to skip live TV."
"4434","I think the Fire stick is a great technology, but unfortunately my rural internet isn't quite strong enough to make it as reliable as I'd like it to be.  But I think the technology is good, it just needs a very high bandwidth internet to work well."
"4435","We love the firestick!  It is so easy to use and offers a varied array of movies and other programming.  This is our second firestick."
"4436","I can stream very quickly from one movie to another. I am extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend everyone get one!"
"4437","Started watching series movie's on fire at my daughter's house.  Knew right then I had to purchase one. The movie selection is awesome."
"4438","So I have a smart tv but I guess it is old enough that it couldn't access Amazon Video. I got the Fire TV Stick and hooked it up. It was so easy to install and setup was a breeze. Now I have access to all the TV apps I couldn't get before. Definitely worth it."
"4439","I really don't know what I ever did with out this. Although it's at my daughter's house now. I will be purchasing another for me."
"4440","Works very well. Need to make a deal with Rabbit Tv and CBS."
"4441","Best investment ever do not forget that!  I have an xbox 1 ps3 wii u wii reg!!! this is my goto remote for the TV all the apps all the power, I was a video game junkie now I'm a hulu youtube netflix crackle junkie because of this"
"4442","Finally I can access Amazon Prime through my smart TV!"
"4443","I still have a lot to learn on how to work this thing, but am very impressed. There are a lot of YouTube videos explaining how to download different apps like Exodus and Kodi for viewing free movies."
"4444","Very nice device, was comparing it to the Roku. I like both and they both have just enough different that I will be using them side by side."
"4445","Hope to cut the Sat cord buying two Firesticks and one Fire TV (the mid-price one) and have Prime. Absolutely does what it says. I have average 25Mbs internet and haven't had stuttering/buffering yet using the 5Ghz connection (for 1080i HDMI)."
"4446","This was a gift for Christmas and a really good investment. I do have some issues....there are absolutely no directions. The insert tells you how to put the batteries in the remote, that's it.  It was difficult to find which apps were free to download and watch. Most apps were free to download and you don't know until after you try to watch them that you have to pay to watch. Just wish there was more instruction and guidance about the apps and what you are able to watch"
"4447","Absolutely love this product. I can stream tons of movies and TV shows, even more so with my Prime account. There's lots more movie and TV options available to rent, and I love that there's the option to play games as well. The only thing I don't like about it is that it has to be plugged in to the wall for power constantly. I thought it was a device that had to charge periodically? I suppose I was wrong. However, a minor inconvenience to an otherwise great product."
"4448","I love it, after a few days of getting the hang of it.  Entirely different from Roku, kept that onbe too, just in case something goes wrong.a"
"4449","Works well does so much with total ease to use. Moves easily from one TV to another. I added a USB fan to cool so no over heating."
"4450","Inexpensive, reasonably easy to install, works well.  Make sure TV or receiver has HTML ports. Instructions for installing remote control batteries useless. Go on line and watch tutorial."
"4451","It is compact, very fast, and the interface is quite slick. For the price, quality, and the freedom Amazon offers in their devices regarding software, you cannot go wrong with it.Also the remote bundled has a nice feel to it and it is very simple to use.However, if you're looking for 4K streaming, you'll have to go for a more expensive option."
"4452","My firetv stick stopped working due to latest update and only had a blank screen. I was able to Google a fix and stick is working again."
"4453","Keep losing my internet connection. I like some feature but not all.I feel quiet silly telling Alexa. to do something .I live alone .I have reset my tv stick and router. Connect for a few minutes then says connection error."
"4454","We cut cable and have both the Roku and fire stick. We love both and are saving a ton of money. The Fire Stick's interface is much better than Roku. It is also very easy to use."
"4455","I have been using this device for only a couple of weeks.  I mainly bought it because my smart DVD player in in a cabinet and oft times loses contact with my wireless. During my limited use of this device, it has only lost contact with my wireless a couple of time.  It responds quickly in moving about the menu.  So far I am pleased and also got it for a bargain on Cyber Monday.  Should my opinion change up on further use, I will edit this reviews.  So far so good."
"4456","Easy to connect and love the Alexa feature. Got this because my DVD player would not stay connected to my router. I would recommend."
"4457","Works with HDMI control/CEC. If your TV does have HDMI control/CEC you can use your TV remote control to control the Firestick, I do not want to deal with multiple remote controls. If Amazon came out with a universal remote control/firestick control then I would use it. But for now the Firestick remote sits in a drawer."
"4458","Very nice flexible device. I use it with Kodi. Would be nice if the remote had a few more buttons on it such as stop and record."
"4459","Works really good for my parents but it is annoying having to log into each and every app. Very happy overall. Great price also."
"4460","Compared to the first generation stick, Sturdier device, quicker processing, experiencing less buffering, better wifi technology etc...alexa voice is not a feature that I am impressed with, have not used yet. To each there own, I am old school I like clicking to search plus I prefer the size and softer operation of the older remote..."
"4461","We love it! Best device to watch my favorite series. More advanced than Apple TV and the best thing: I can now watch Amazon Prime on my not so smart TV!!"
"4462","Very easy to follow instructions including attachuing to wireless...Still playing around with all the functions a ns access points"
"4463","We bought this for my Mother and she is over-the- moon happy with it!  She is so excited to be able to watch Hulu while she sews in her craft room.  It has allowed she and my father to have a little bit of time where they can each watch what they want on tv. She LOVES it!  Highly recommended!"
"4464","I,m 69 years old and not very tech savvy but I had no trouble setting the new fire stick up. It was delivered on time and i,m very happy with the way it works. My only complaint is with the remote,it seems to just shut off. If I take the batteries out and reinstall them , it will work again. All and all I love the my new fire stick ,and alexa works great. If your thinking about buying one, do yourself a favor and press the buy now button. Lee"
"4465","I had no idea of how this worked but decided to give it a try.  I have Amazon Prime and up until now could only watch the free movies, etc. on my computer!  Now we can watch them on our TV!  That alone makes this well worth it!  It was very easy to set up (even for me!) and easy to use!"
"4466","Works great when it works. Device consistently crashes and reboots itself randomly. May happen right in the middle of a show. May crash every 30 minutes or not at all. When it is working, all the apps work great."
"4467","Love the fire stick.  Alexa works great with it as well. Thinking of turning our cable off and going with just the fire stick tv!"
"4468","If you don't have one.., get one! This works great even with a slow internet service and is much cheaper than DirecTv or Dish Network."
"4469","Have trouble with the remote fro day one. It is intermittent. To get it to work or reset I have to pull a battery out and install it to get the remote to work.  Pairing it up does not fix the problem"
"4470","I don’t usually write reviews and I’m on my phone so I’ll keep it short. The fire stick is amazing! I maininy use it to stream from netflix and YouTube and the results are fantastic! Comparing it to my smart Samsung televisions preinstalled apps, this is incomparably better! A lot better than chrome cast and roku in my opinion as I used all three. It’s due to the fact that the operating system is closely matched to android so it runs smooth and efficiently! :)"
"4471","I love, love LOVE the Fire Stick.  Works great. The picture is better than what I used previously and it has only ""buffered"" once.  I get Amazon Video, Netflix, Youtube and Pandora with no issues. The voice feature is great.  I haven't attempted to mirror my cell or computer yet as it does require an additional app for that and I haven't had time.  Oh, I also love that I can move it from room to room and the remote is small and very simple when needed."
"4472","This is our second fire stick. We bought it as a present. It's very convenient for our family members that want to watch Netflix, etc. on a TV but don't have a smart TV or a gaming system. Easier to use than google chrome because they don't have to be casting from a different device. Easy to install and easy for them to switch between TVs. I have not tried the Alexa feature. My only experience with Alexa is with the dot and it has a hard time understanding me."
"4473","FireStick functionality is good, but the Alexa is a waste.  We have both FireStick and FireTV and it either doesn't understand or can't perform the function.  It feels like old GPS, Recalculating..."
"4474","If you don't have one of these, you should definitely get one.Easy to use and MUCH better than my Apple-TV-2 units. I'm done with Apple.And you can add extra programming to this via open-source software without any major ""jail breaking""."
"4475","I love the Alexa voice feature! I also love the fact that I can use the app on my phone as a remote, and it has a keyboard option!!"
"4476","I bought this for my mother to be able to watch DirectTV NOW. It's ok, but we have had to restart the stick several times in the past week."
"4477","Wish I had done this years ago! I only kept my Dish tv for local news programming and if the internet goes down in bad weather. Simple to use and the viewing options seem limitless."
"4478","Love it so far! Had it for a week and the entire family used it! Ages 4-42 lol. The ease and speed of finding movies, game selection for the kids, all the kid shows.. I feel like I could cancel my cable and be happy! Couple dislikes... some games require you to download the game controller app on your phone, little confusing.. and some common apps aren't available. Oh and the parental control is great, no accidental purchases. Very pleased overall. We use it every day."
"4479","I have NO complaints about making this purchase! I also got a GREAT deal on it and since I don't have WiFi, I use my personal Hotspot to watch all my Netflix and HBOGo shows!! I LOVE the Fire TV Stick!!!"
"4480","This makes cutting the cord from cable or satellite possible, and easy.  Streams not just Amazon content, but most other services."
"4481","We ordered this to have access to Amazon prime video, Netflix and Hulu all in one place. It works great and has way more to offer than just the things we were looking for. We bought a digital antenna to get local channels and use this for access to all kinds of programming and are now saving $150/month by cutting the cable cord finally! Awesome!"
"4482","Well, I am very satisfied with the fire stick. I did however have one issue which was corrected by calling customer service. Initially, when I played a movie the sound did not sync with what was playing. Called customer service and within a minute everything was fine."
"4483","I thought if you have amazon prime you can watch just about anything, I was wrong no you can't. It's not worth it and for what I pay for I should get more."
"4484","I haven't had a lot of time to watch TV, but I'm more excited about how easy it was to hook up and follow the installation details.  Very easy--no complications whatsoever.  I'm very happy to finally be a Netflix watcher.  Thanks so much for this device!  Technology is amazing!!!"
"4485","I have not had time to see all that it appears to be capable of yet. Setup was simple. No regrets at having purchased. Only four stars due to lack of use at this time, but has potential."
"4486","good"
"4487","I was very pleased with the Fredrick until recently.  It is less than a year old and keeps dropping the internet connection. I have had to reset the stick 3 times this week.  Come on Amazon"
"4488","Very fast loading time. No lag like the roku I replaced. It was an excellent buy for the price and performance. Easy to set up and use."
"4489","awsome product.  took a while for it to come in due to high demand for them.  i watch a lot of anime and movies on it.  have not had any issues with the product.  it is a solid item to buy and easy to use.the only con i had is that i had to use the hdmi extender from the back of my tv cause the stick was a little too long for my sony tv."
"4490","I love mine!!  Ask it to find an address, a TV show, A Movie, the Weather, and it does it, plus it has a neat slide show if left ideal for awhile!"
"4491","No problems with it yet. Works as it should. 4 stars just because I would like to see the app store grow some more. But very much worth the money."
"4492","We were using the Wii to watch Netflix but found the Firestick provided a much better viewing experience. Still haven't checked out all the other things it can do yet. Love it!"
"4493","havent used it that much but what i have it works great...i have an omgfreetv and i really think the firestick works much better"
"4494","Love this! I finally ""cut the cable"" due to expense and lack of choices. I ordered and attached this simple device and Voila! many more options clear HD pictures. Amazon Prime gives such great programming you can binge on many shows and movies. I also have Netflix so my cable saving my $120 a month. I love using the Alexa Voice control jus think of an old TV show or movie and it will search with in seconds to give you options. Would recommend to everyone!"
"4495","Typical crap hardware from Amazon. This thing freezes at least once a day and the voice command doesn't work at all. Still an easy way to access Amazon Prime video on your TV. Save your money and buy an Apple TV instead"
"4496","The Amazon Firestick is easy to set up and use, and it's nearly perfect for streaming channels like Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, etc. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 star rating, is that VUDU isn't offered."
"4497","I have bought 3 firesticks and they are all amazing my kids love to watch all the shows they want. My wife and I can enjoy watching tv together or in separate rooms I will definitely be getting a couple more firesticks!"
"4498","Stick has to be ""rebooted"" by disconnecting from power and TV at each start. A bit frustrating as my set up isn't convenient to do this. Once it's working, it is fine."
"4499","Absolutely love it!  So many shows and movies we have not seen!  So easy to hook up and use. A whole new world of TV enjoyment."
"4500","Love my Fire stick but hate Alexis! She will forget what I just asked for or she just don't know! Irritating more than helpful."
"4501","Where has this been all of my life! We take it when we travel and we don't miss a beat. I love how user friendly it is as well."
"4502","The shipping took forever. However, the product was worth the wait. After installation the picture was great.It works as advertised."
"4503","This is a great FireStick and so easy with the Voice. When I ask the Alexa it gets videos across from Netflix to Amazon which is great"
"4504","It doesn't have Spectrum/ TWC app!!! Also for older TV convert to HDMI connection , the picture isn't good!!!Otherwise is good just for regular HD or smart TV."
"4505","Works perfectly and everything is exactly how I was hoping it would work. Easy to set up and use. Would definitely recommend it."
"4506","I am not interested in streaming videos and movies as I am in my 70s. However i do like to watch Fox news and CNBC and Fox business and a few other live broadcast shows.It  took me several days to figure out how to find and open DirecTV Now, but it is very difficult to navigate to anything with the fire stick. And I am a retired computer guy and savvy to most electronic stuff.We had a word for this in the IT world.  The device is ""kludgy""."
"4507","I've purchased 4 fire stickes from Amazon. The voice Fire Sticks have a newer interface ( icons look different and menu is updated). This one looks like the first Fire Stick I purchased. I'm very dissappointed with this one. Why is it not updated? What can I do to the the updated view. For instance when I select something the icon spins around and the screen options look like my first Fire Stick Very unhappy. But I gues if it works there's nothing I can do???"
"4508","If you don't have a smart TV, then this is what you need. Even if you do, get one. I signed up for DirecTV Now and spend $35 a month for like 60 channels with no taxes and it runs through the Fire Stick. Literally saving myself $135 a month after dropping Verizon, do yourself a favor, get this, get DIRECTV Now and get rid of your cable company. All the apps are great to, all in one, DIRECTV, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon TV and movies. Best decision I've ever made"
"4509","So far so good. I had a issue trying to use Google chromecast in my bedroom. The Wi-Fi struggle in and out to stay connect. I do not have that problem with the Amazon Stick. I wanted to purchase and try it out for a while. When cyber Monday came I took a chance. I am even more happy that I waited because with the Alexa feature it makes it even better. Once I test out that it can stream from SHOWBOX, I will change my rating to a 5 stars instead of 4. Stay tuned."
"4510","Sometimes when watching HBO Now it stops mid-show and goes to the menu screen. Other than that, it's great. The other apps work great, picture is clear."
"4511","Very easy to set up. Very easy to use. It recognizes my voice very well to look up shows. And it loads them very quickly. Very pleased with this product"
"4512","For some reason, does not offer the Spectrum TV app, or its predecessor, TWC app. Generally love the device but will return to Roku."
"4513","Good so far. Easy to set up. Couple different options for connecting to tv. Quick to start and play. Nice remote. Voice is nice too."
"4514","I love it.  I saw the ""Manchester by the sea"" was availableso As soon as I got it set up I said ""Manchester by the sea"" and alexa found itShe also did the weather."
"4515","After using it for several days, it started going on and off at a frequency which made it impossible to view anything.  Before this time, I was liking it a lot.  The selection of movies are better than the selection at Netflix,"
"4516","Well it plays internet content fine, as expected. Wireless setup was easy and work the first try.  Voice commands OK, found Sarah Brightman on the first try, but does not work with YouTube app, not really a deal breaker.  The Home button on the remote is in the location of the enter ( play it ) button on all the rest of the remotes in the house, this is a pain in the butt, to be returned to the home screen all the time"
"4517","I love the FireTV Stick and will completely eliminate cable soon!! I have 2 sticks and a few more to go! They are very easy to use and the savings are great compared to AT&T, Xfinity, Dish Network, which is what I've had the past several years. Time for a change."
"4518","Purchased this for my 60+ year old mom. She wanted to save a few bucks and cut the cable company cord, so bought her a Fire Stick and HD omni antenna. She's loving it!"
"4519","Every home should have one!  I never knew anything about this before my sons turned me on to the realities of the world....just had kept paying those HIGH cable bills!"
"4520","A very good product that met all my expectations, it fills in the gaps - the content not provided by my ROKUstreaming stick.  I use them both, and I think having them both is very useful, not just duplications of thesame things as some people might think."
"4521","So disappointed because I wanted to love it.  We have a strong Wi-Fi connection but this connects inconsistently and the remote has drained the batteries twice in less than a week."
"4522","Arrived on time and I love it ! Easy to set up and use. Cable prices are getting too high. We plan on purchasing more of this product for our other tv's ."
"4523","I have 3 Roku Boxes and 1 Roku Stick. I bought a Amazon Fire Stick (After buying an Alexa and wanting an extra Remote) about 2 months ago. I have since bought 2 more, Talked My Brother (who was a 6x Roku owner), Cousin, and 2 Son-in Laws into Buying one. Needless to say - Good Buy Roku - I love The Amazon Fire Stick !"
"4524","I am still exploring this product but am very happy so far. It was super easy to set up (and I am horrible at ""tech stuff"") and use. A little disappointed that there are so many programs you have to ""purchase"" to view but there is enough otherwise to make it worth it."
"4525","We purchased one of these to replace our cable subscription. Coupled with amazon prime its been fantastic. NO commercials, and shows on demand is the way to go. Plus we're saving money!"
"4526","Easy to set up and easy to use.  Still working on the Alexa part though. Suits my needs and very inexpensive compared to others."
"4527","I loveeeee my Amazon firestick!!! Thousands upon thousands of free movies. I might never leave home!!! Excellent"
"4528","I'm kinda disappointed with the firestick.  It is slow and sometimes freezes up.  There is no way to expand the memory. I wish it ran a decent version of Android.  There is no us input.  I own a Nexus player and a Nvidia shield they will walk circle's around the firestick.  The Nvidia shield is more expensive but is pretty much unlimited abilities.  The Nexus player is pretty impressive for a 50.00 investment.  Plus the Nexus player just got the Oreo update."
"4529","I love my Fire Stick but the Alexa feature can be a pain.  Hopefully, I'll adjust to it but it can be frustrating.  For the price and the wide selection of choices, The Fire Stick is a real bargain.  I stream music, listen to my audiobooks and watch all the PBS shows I love but the selection of streaming options beyond that is almost infinite.  I don't need cable with the Fire Stick.  Combined with Amazon's unparallelled customer service, you can't go wrong."
"4530","We replaced our Roku unit with the firestick and love the beautiful and easy to use interface, plus the ability to download additional apps."
"4531","I recently purchased the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote at my wife's request so she could relax and watch NETFLIX on the weekends. So far she loves it. Plus, at a price of $39.99, I felt it was at a reasonable price once you considered the voice remote functionality included with it."
"4532","Nice product that turns on  my TV to all my apps and lets me select what ones I want to watch. Does not turn my TV Off though."
"4533","This will be perfect to take with me on travel! Now I can have all my shows and music with me.  Installation was a breeze too."
"4534","Why pay for cable and movies when you can pretty much watch anything you can think of?! FOR FREE. (after you jailbreak it, download kodi app and exodus.. Watch YouTube videos, you'll figure it out) One of my favorites shows is based out of Australia (Wentworth.. It's like OITNB but way better) and the next day after it airs I can watch it on this. No more waiting for Netflix! This is a game changer!"
"4535","I love this, so glad I bought it! Portable enough to move from one tv to another and quality product. I like the voice feature."
"4536","Loved it so much we bought another one for our downstairs TV.  Regular TV is no comparison to this!  Find anything at any time!"
"4537","My mom has the last gen firestick, and after seeing her use it I wanted one. This version with the Alexa voice is so much more coniveient. You say a movie or show and it'll open it with any app you have that will offer that movie or show. You can also tell ask to open any apps you may use, such as twitch, and it'll open right up. I love this handy little streamer."
"4538","It's ok but we have 5 televisions and need to be able to watch them all, plus be able to watch local over the air channels/stations.I mean, do I need a Fire TV Stick for each tv?...I have not been able to find info on doing the above except for a 'MOHU 50' Indoor antenna for local stations, which doesn't do well because of distance of towers and trees."
"4539","For me this was an upgrade from the first fire tv stick.  Having the extra processing power really helps the non native apps to run smoothly.  Ib did have since difficulty getting it set up.  I tried to hook up the stick to HDMI2 slot. It would get stuck in a loop of updates... once I hooked up the new fire tv stick to HDMI1 slot,  it was golden.  The voice feature is nice,  but IMO the upgrade to the processor is the real upgrade.Great product.  Great price"
"4540","this worked out very well for us, we get a lot of channels that I could only watch on my computer, now I watch them on the big TV"
"4541","We already own one firestick & love it so much we got another one for our bedroom. The alexa feature is cool & saves time from not having to type everything out! & we have cancelled cable & now save $100/month!"
"4542","If you are thinking about the Kindle Fire Stick. Quit thinging and go ahead and spend that 39.99. I promise you you will not regreat it. The only thing that bothers me is I waited this long to spend that tiny amount of money. Thank you Amazon. Amazon customer for life. Tiffanie"
"4543","So far I like this more than the Apple TV box I have, so I ordered another one to take with us on vacation or even use outside."
"4544","Very good Wi-Fi. Good organization of menus & remote simple & effective. I get absolutely nothing else in the way of programming. I have to purchase subscriptions to anything I want to watch, including network channels. I'm also concerned the size of storage is only 8GB & no way to add external storage."
"4545","If you are looking to 'cut the cord', this is a good way to start. When coupled with an ota antenna and DVR, your only problem will be trying to figure out what to do with all the money you saved."
"4546","Would buy again and again for friends and family. This is a great product. Easy to install. The Fire-stick came pre-programmed and WOW !"
"4547","I needed a replacement for the remote I had first bought a few years ago, but this I couldn't get it to work with the Fire unit I had so I replaced it with the stick."
"4548","We have not gone to the movies in one year.  Once you download special KODI APP you are able to see every movie you desire.  Great for a family with young children and no babysitter.  You can have your own date nights at home while kids are sleeping.  Don't forget the popcorn😊"
"4549","I did not know I had to plug it in a socket while it is plugged into the TV.  So I have to try again in a few days when I get back into town."
"4550","this is more then likely the best streaming device out there so far----even though Comcast is going to try and compete they will never be able to match the price"
"4551","It is a great way to stream videos to your tv. It turns your television into a smart tv. I would love it even more if it had a web browser function so that I could browse the net a bit.There are a lot of apps.  Some you have to pay a subscription fee for.  I registered for trials for a lot of them.  The games seem very basic, but it is fun.It is a great purchase.  I am so glad I chose this one over Roku.  The Alexa is an awesome feature as well."
"4552","We love the New Fire TV Stick!!  My 9 year old son was begging me for the Xfinity one but I didn't want to go with a Comcast Internet.  With the Fire Stick I can use any internet and it can travel with me too!  It loads super fast not like the Apple TV which made you wait an hour to load a movie.  And we never get bumped off.  It's all we watch now because it serves all our needs.  I'm planning to get another one for my kids TV room.  I highly recommend it!"
"4553","I'd give it 5 stars if:1. Amazon wasn't constantly pushing it's content on you.2. Alexa falsely returns no results for Hulu for a show they have and instead prompts you to purchase it through Amazon.  Clicking on see other sources doesn't return the Hulu link.  Some shows search fine some do this.Overall this is a good streaming stick.  Kodi can be installed without much hassle along with any other streaming app you might want."
"4554","I love my new Firestick. I had a small problem in the beginning because my HDMI splitter wouldn't work. A brief call to tech support and two days later from Amazon Prime my new electronic remote controlled splitter arrived and all is well.The biggest plus is that I use it in hotels and motels.Get one now!"
"4555","I love my amazon fire stick!!! It has been such an awesome experience. I wouldn't trade i t for anything not even apple tv!! It runs smoothly and quick so many options to buy or get for free. I just love this way better than buy cable just invest into WiFi or use the free WiFi at your apts and works amazing love this"
"4556","This is a great upgrade from the previous model which we also own.  I love how quick the remote responds to the buttons and how clear the picture is.  The added alexa voice feature is awesome!  I can simply tell alexa to open an app and it's done.  This is well worth the price!"
"4557","I love this fire stick and the ease it was to set up and use with Alexa. now I can find movies and TV shows just by asking Alexa. love it"
"4558","I love this thing. I don't use the Alexa service but that's just me. The ease of use and variety of programs movies, etc. Is outstanding."
"4559","We love it. It goes well with our prime membership."
"4560","AWESOME Purchase!I really love the new fire stick. I no longer need Netfllix or any other application to watch movies. Say goodbye to Redbox as well. Everything you need is right on this device."
"4561","Alexa easier than ever before! The remote is responsive and ergonomic as well. A must have for anyone who has TV and the internet."
"4562","the device is fine,  Its similar to all the rest.  I'm just on the fence about the value of the amazon prime service over netflix."
"4563","Easy set up navigation is simple I would recommend this product seems to do everything it says it will i don't have great intrernet service to take full advantage of the Firestick yet.This is the first streaming device I've used and I'm very satisfied I can't imagine any other devices being much better but I only use it for Netflix and Sling sometimes the Alexa voice option so I'm not that tech savvy like a lot of users out there."
"4564","It's the most amazing piece of technology ever, and that's coming from a shamed TV lover! This the new xfinity, for half the price, if you've got the right channels! Love it!"
"4565","Works well, but have to pay for every single little thing on the stick, so I really don't see where all the savings are at.  When all said and done, to set it up like I have my other provider, I would be paying right at 45 dollars MORE a month for the same thing I have with my other provider.  So please tell me where the savings are at?UPDATE:Ordered 2 more for out of area trips. For some reason, these new 2 were more difficult to set up and update than the last one."
"4566","Had to buy the fire stick because my smart tv was lacking in options.  For anyone who has a prime membership, this thing is a must!"
"4567","This was a great purchase, I have access to all my programs in one little device.This includes Hulu, Netflix, etc. a great buy for anyone!"
"4568","I love it so far!  I did have a little trouble cancelling an app subscription.  I downloaded Sling TV and then decided I wasn't watching enough to warrant paying a monthly subscription.  I could not figure out how to cancel it and I'm still not sure I did it correctly.  That is my only negative.  I love all the movies and TV shows on the Firestick.  The best part is saving $135 a month for cable!!!"
"4569","Works better than a smart TV.  Just love it. Keeps the grandkids off regular TV broadcasting and on their endless supply of chosen children's shows."
"4570","Great....everyone should have a Fire Stick. Wow  ! What a great item for the entire family and you alone. Great value for a great product."
"4571","More thought out and better designed than APPLE TV.  This is a great addition and my reason to cut the cord!Well done to the designers of this product.  They've thought of everything, and that's rare these days."
"4572","I really like my fire stick. Sometimes it's slow but I think that might be the streaming site and the the stick is away from the modem. It doesn't happen often. I highly recommend it's very easy to use."
"4573","If you are an Alexa fan, you have to have one of these.  Replaced our Roku with this and love it.  Voice commands work great."
"4574","I have been using my VCR to stream movies. I find the Fire TV Stick much more, user-friendly. Alexa Voice Remote is the bomb."
"4575","Really like the Amazon Fire TV stick!!!  It works great.  Looking at getting additional units for the other TV's in our home."
"4576","I like this so much more than using cable. People have been recommending so many shows to me. Geesh, there are a lot of them. Enjoy!"
"4577","Great device, easy set up, user friendly operation, decent price. We are very happy with it, much better than expensive cable costs."
"4578","A great product- easy to use, especially the voice activation, with a tremendous content of movies, TV, and channels to choose from."
"4579","Better than expected. Bought a second one already......opened up a lot of new shows and even the game have been a lot of fun for my daughter and I...."
"4580","Really like this, it works great, good enough to almost give cable up. We had used Roku and like this better because of Alexa"
"4581","This is a awesome device that is very user friendly and easy to set up. I enjoy the easy navigation with this device and the fact that these are one of the handful of Android Streaming devices that are very easy to customize. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family and I think that every one should own one of these. My wife and I already had a Roku when we decided to purchase the Fire TV Stick and we now use this more than our Roku."
"4582","I have had my Fire Stick for about 2 months now. At first it was great! I was finding the majority of content I was looking for and the unit almost never crashed. In the past few weeks this has drastically changed. Now the Fire stick will lost internet connectivity about every 90 minutes for no apparent reason. None of my other connected devices will drop the connection, so it is not my WiFi source as the problem. Why is this happening over and over again?"
"4583","I love my Firestick. The Alexa voice remote works wonderfully! It can take up to a minute to load a channel or program. A setback for me is that unlike a Google Chromecast you have to plug a power cord into the fire stick, causing one more thing in your outlet."
"4584","Fire tv with Alexa voice is great, best media stick out there. Easy to set up & use. The device is fast in loading up media content. You can't go wrong with it specially with the price tag."
"4585","The Fire stick is awesome.  It is very user friendly and very easy to set up.  The only suggestion that I would have for purchasers of this product is to look up how to open the remote control to insert the batteries on youtube.com.  I couldn't figure it out and may still be trying to open it had I not looked it up."
"4586","Worked beautifully.  At first I couldn't get the remote to ""talk"" to the Firestick to make anything happen.  I walked away a couple of hrs and tried it again and it has worked ever since."
"4587","Super easy to install and the voice is fun to play  with in addition to being functional.  What I really like is being to speak the name of a movie rather than having to go through typing it out like you have to do with straight cable or satellite.  It was also nice purchasing an electronic dodad that didn't cost an arm and a leg."
"4588","easy set up. works like a charm, love to connection to Alexawould be nice if can work with my external keyboard to save time and energy when looking for titles"
"4589","Amazon needs to suck it up and Let VUDU be a app on there system. That is reason I sent it back I have over 700 movies on my VUDU that I was not going to forget about and had to use 2 different system"
"4590","I absolutely love my firestick! No need for big cable bills or crazy installation fees. As long as you have internet it is amazing! You do have to pay for certain features such as Netflix or Amazon TV (unless you have amazon prime). The only thing I dislike is that my dog ate my remote and I had to purchase an entirely new firestick instead of just a replacement remote since the remote is not interchangeable. But its still worth it :-)"
"4591","Just learn about Firetv when I went to purchase the RuKu.  Salesperson conveniences me the FireTv was better.  So, I purchased the FireTv.  I have yet to learn to operate it.  I found no simple instructions.  I did go back and purchased Amazon Prime and things got a little more manageable.  I still believe if I had written instructions showing a step by step and what to expect next would help a person like me who lacks the know-it-all."
"4592","My review is this.  If you want to cut the cable cord correctly all the content is on the media player.  If you are actually using the excuse to go to someone to download illegal content then you need to read the TOS agreement.  Obviously as my gpa once said ""Do you believe everything that people tell you and you hear?  Also its not always the price of the item but what the item actually does."
"4593","I'm your average single female buyer. I have two chrome attachments and the FIRE TV STICK with Voice remote is the BEST THING I HAVE EVER BOUGHT. I've never complemented anything about packaging but even the packaging was well thought out. It was soooooo easy to attach to the TV. I've been cable free for 8 years and it was the best thing I did. Having the  apps on the stick itself is a big winner."
"4594","Works fantastically! I can stream music an watch movies all with 1 click or voice command with the Alexa remote. Amazing product and was delivered on time."
"4595","The fire stick is more then I thought, the Alexa voice remote is incredibly accurate and can do more then help find shows. I find my self asking it what the weather is like or to define or provide information on topics and words I'm not familiar with . The speed and accuracy of the remote is surprising for the price and the build quality is better then that of my Verizon fios remote. Would absolutely recommend this to any one who could make use of the features."
"4596","This exceeded my expectations.  It is faster than m Apple TV and gets more channels as well.  Sound quality is great and having Alexa functionality is a great bonus as well.Speaking of Alexa Functionality, please be aware that this will not be the full functionality you get from something like the Echo or Echo dot.  But you do get really nice display cards for those functions that do work, such as the weather."
"4597","Works great on my TV, except I have to change from HDMI ports each time I want to go back and watch cable TV. Bu that's not Amazon's fault and my wife & I enjoy the Fire stick so far."
"4598","After viewing YouTube videos I was confident in programming my Firestick, since quite a few apps asked to subscribe, log in, or put in code. It was confusing at first, but enjoy it now."
"4599","Great product for the price. Especially if you only have Wi-Fi. Make sure you have prime, and adding a channel like HBO makes it the bomb. Enjoy!"
"4600","it is kind of confusing, but i am sure i will get the hang of it. right now i am in the process of trying to set up my closed captioning."
"4601","I was  so excited,  I now have Alexa in my bedroom.  I can listen to music and tell her to turn a certain movie and she does.  I love it."
"4602","These things are the best! Turns any TV into a smart TV. The app store is extensive and it's a must for anyone who has Amazon Prime."
"4603","Voice search comes in handy. You can use it to find anything. I use this stick all the time. It's pretty smooth and has never broke."
"4604","Amazing!  Not just Amazon on this stick but I can get all the other cable stations in one place easily and can watch series from the beginning. My only complaint has to do with packaging. Directions would be helpful."
"4605","Fire stick it’s self works great, it was very simple to install but am not quite satisfied with the so called free movies even with prime most movies I like to watch it ether wants 3.99 to rent or more to purchase my understanding was with prime most or all movies were free I would understand if they new releases but I’m an old movie person and one out of 10 I like wants a rental price. I think they should change there advertising of free movies with prim"
"4606","I just received this as a Christmas gift.  I haven't had cable or satellite for 4 years and have been watching Prime on my MacBook, but this is so much better. The biggest thing I notice is that I don't get any buffering at all! I have a fairly slow DSL connection for my internet, and it has not been a problem at all.  Alexa has been working well, but she can't see to get ""Listen to Mahavishnu Orchestra""!  But other than that, she's been accurate."
"4607","I think it is OK. It is complicated. My wife is learning how to use it from our granddaughter. We still don't know how or if we can always get capations. I' very hard of hearing, and without capations, I haven't watched anything with it. My wife can hear, and we started tp watch one movie with it she tried to wxplain what was going on but we gave up. My granddaughter will be back in a week. She knows how to do it and should be able to make it work for us."
"4608","I have only had the Fire stick for a couple of days and have not had a lot of time to experiment but from what I have seen so far it has surpassed what I was expecting.  Looking forward to trying more."
"4609","Love this product.  Didn't realize how old my Roku was until I installed this to replace the Roku.  Easy to install, great features and great quality. I immediately bought a second one for my other TV."
"4610","Ok build Did not have terraniun tv but good so far. Having slight trouble with with streams but could be my internet. Thanks"
"4611","Firestick.  Great product and can even ""cut the cable"" with it if you'd like so you don't have to pay a monthly fee."
"4612","Doesn't synch well with my Samsung software. I have to unplug it and reinsert it for my TV to sense it. Chromcast is better."
"4613","This is just great.  I bought a smart TV and it's so laggy I ended up getting this fire stick and use it instead.  Fast, responsive, love it!"
"4614","I am so glad I got the amazon firestick! I was concerned that it might be difficult to set up but setup was surprisingly easy and took about 5 minutes. It comes with everything you need to set it up. I use it to watch Netflix, Hulu, Prime and to listen to spotify and pandora."
"4615","This little device is so powerful, it just works and works very well. I got to get on line and see if there are instructions and a channel guide. It is actually quite intuitive, but I miss the official cheat sheet."
"4616","Constantly rebooting and the device overheats...there have been times that the device is almost too hot to handle! Can no longer use for fear of fire"
"4617","Love love.  Setup was a no brainer.  It understands what you say and no hunting and  peck to fine movies.  All you need is wifi.Alexa is great."
"4618","I was very pleased with the older version of the Fire TV Stick.  And the same goes with this upgraded version with Alexa Voice Remote.  The main reason for upgrading was to provide better reception for the FilmStruck app (which is amazing!).  The older version did not fully support that app and now I'm happy to say the new Fire TV Stick works like a charm.  I've noticed that the performance on other apps has improved also, especially with Sling TV.  Excellent!"
"4619","Received a day before it was scheduled to arrive and setup was easy (I already have 2 other fire sticks) since we've been using it we have noticed that some apps that we had on our other stick (TNT specifically) aren't offered on this one, which is extreamly frustrating since we got this one for our living room.I haven't used ""Alexa"" too much since I'm so used to the old version,but when I have it's worked well!I hope they work Out the app issue soon!"
"4620","I really like the fire stick features, my remote seems to drain the battery fast and doesn't work sometimes unless I hold the mic button down. Takes severall trys or even taking out batteries and replacing. Put in new batteries thought problem was solved but it's still happening"
"4621","I love that this is voice activated and very easy to use.  I actually installed it myself and believe me....that's a miracle.  I can access Netflix, pandora and all my movie extra channels very easy now and a great interface"
"4622","Works great! Love the updated UI. Very zippy. Easy to install and update. A great collection to our Amazon/Alexa integration"
"4623","Works great! Even got the red cover for it :) Plugged it into my new projector and it works amazing! Better than Roku.... so far!"
"4624","I had an original Fire TV Stick, which I thought was a great value but had become slow. This newer version is great. Super fast!"
"4625","I love the firestick and it works well.  I like how I can view newly released movies and catch up on shows that I have missed."
"4626","Great product. Beats streaming my Amazon Prime videos from my iPhone or laptop. For 39$ it's a deal given that it includes streaming clients from other video providers."
"4627","Love this product.. I will buy another one - once it goes on sale..... I actually might buy the bigger version - Once its on sale..lol"
"4628","The apps that this device has all work very well and look nice. The setup is easy and the Alexa remote has been nice to use and works well. It is a well made product. The reason for the 3 stars? The Amazon App store is really holding this product back and has some big omissions in my opinion. No Starz, Epix , or Cinemax apps really hurt this for me. If the absence of these apps (and a few more that slip my mind ) don't bother you then add another star and a half to my score.."
"4629","I am very happy with the fire stick.  It makes my TV in the kitchen into a smart TV which doesn't seem to be available in the smaller TV sizes.The remote could use some better design however.  Trying to open the battery compartment was very difficult... one needed 5 hands to do it.  Plus the remote could use some arrows or dots on the outer circle rim to let you know it is the navigational component.  LOve the Alexa feature.. especially to play music."
"4630","I think the concept of the stick is great...the price is great...the REMOTE STINKS!  I've had nothing but trouble with the remote which affects the total operation of the stick...so much so that I don't want to attempt to use it.  I contacted AMAZON and they will replace the remote around the 20th of January...they are currently out.  They did admit to some problems with the remote...but the stick doesn't work without the remote so they better fix the remote...FAST@"
"4631","Great device I'm having one heck of a time for  myself lots of movies docs, and to many other things to watch. love this thing."
"4632","I LOVE IT!!!!  I've been telling all my friends and associates about buying one or 2.  I'm going to buy a couple more as Christmas gifts.  I got rid of my Directv.  I'll be saving over $1700 a year with my Firestick.  The only thing I don't like is the TV goes dark and silent after you watch what you were watching."
"4633","The UI is different from Roku which is what I'm used to.  After a couple of weeks, I have no issues with it.  I do wish there is a way to control the auto-play, sometimes you just want to get more description without having the content to start playing in the background.  All the apps I use are there, not missing anything from Roku, well, it is actually better than Roku since I now have the updated Netflix app that supports profiles.  Yes, you suck Roku!"
"4634","My previous experience with almost all things electronic has been less than encouraging but this Firestick was way different; tiny little box overflew wires and/or confusion about where to plug them in.  Then figuring out how to turn it on (not intuitive any more than turning it off) keying in my password the old fashioned way and it was  done!  Alexa understands my spoken language with no instruction and is a snap to have do my bidding.  Great purchase!"
"4635","I am trying to get my husband away from the high cost of DirectTV. I bought a ROKU, but my husband's work friends strongly encouraged him to go to the Fire TV Stick. Which by what I could see was no different.....I was wrong. Our Fire TV Stick isn't completely compatible with or 2011 Sanyo 50"" plasma flat screen TV. We cannot get any sound. After several calls and internet searches; I have bought an adapter that I am hopeful will resolve the problem."
"4636","It works beautifully as expected and lived up to its expectation I was shocked at how fast and smooth interface was I have to admit Amazon pull it off again however I did not sign up for the prime service nevertheless I will take advantage of the other features like DirecTV now and Netflix I think this is a great supplement for any cable TV satellite option I look forward to using the firestick and hope it will continue to mature into a very good product"
"4637","Definitely beats having cable and the cost that went along with it. Wish I had purchased the fire stick from Amazon a long time ago.  Works very well for my family's streaming needs - out of the box, it linked directly to my Amazon prime account and is really easy to use!  Great product!"
"4638","I love how Amazon packs their products, when I bought my first Kindle I was in awe of the beautiful packaging and the Fire TV Stick is no different. The stick is great, my only complaint is that it only connects to 2.4 GHz, it would be so much better if it could connect to 5 GHz as well."
"4639","***update after leaving it alone for a few days decided to give the app a try only to find the remote decided to start working.Ordered this back in February, finally took it out of the box to try it and the remote does not work. Did a battery change and factory reset trying to get it to work with no success.After doing some research found this to be a common problem--for the price do not feel like I should have to download an app to use the product.Would not recommend."
"4640","Instructions are not clear.  I thought it was also going to serve as an antenna to pick up local channels"
"4641","Just got our fire stick and can't say enough about Amazon being on the ball! Our tv had the spot  in a obscure area that the fire stick couldn't begin to fit in so we figured had to wait until we got a extention. Oh no Amazon already thought of that! Easy as pie setup! Love Amazon"
"4642","I love it! Once I found all the pieces-they are very cleverly packaged-I got it set up and was binge-ing an Amazon originial in no time."
"4643","It's okay. We bought two of them. We have had them for a little while now. One works fine but the other one you have to reset it all the time. Not sure what the problem is."
"4644","I have the fire TV gaming edition and the fire stick  I am more than satisfied with both .I wish everything was this easy to set up"
"4645","I am happy that it makes it easier to stream my Netflix and Hulu..  I am told it does more but being a non techie I guess I am happy more or less."
"4646","Works great. However, there would be some symbols on the remote, showing Enter for the big button and arrows for up, down, right, left direction.  It took me a while to even realize that big button wasn't a speaker."
"4647","It worked exactly as I was told by the millions and millions of people that have already purchased this awesome product. Even though I don't live at home any more, still able to use my parents dish account to be able to access live programing thru the apps. Cable cutter for sure."
"4648","The only problem I had with the fire stick was opening the back cover to insert the batteries.  I think you should change the design.  I have given it four stars because of it.  Otherwise, it would have been five."
"4649","Have had the original Fire TV mini-box with speak-to-remote for 2-1/2 years, and have been very happy with it. I just bought the Fire Stick which plugs into my Smart TV. The remote functions the same with voice input. I love the smaller device. Less clutter on my TV console, less cabling. I carry my Fire TV with me when I travel, and to my vacation home. The stick is so much easier to pack and carry. And it still has the wonderful voice control and search."
"4650","We love it . So much easier than roku . An beware with roku ! They kept Charging me for something I cancelled 4 months ago ."
"4651","I ordered this Fire Stick and was really excited but every couple seconds it drops internet connectivity. I have a very good router and have quite a bit of experience working on modems, routers and wifi networks. They later recommended a certain type of router is needed which should be specified in the network capabilities which blows my mind that they can push a ""new"" product thats not backwards compatible even if it is a low percentage effected by this!"
"4652","Use it on our tv outside and works great! Even if you're not a prime member, it can launch a whole variety of applications! Great quality on the streaming but my biggest gripe is the power cord that is required for best quality. All the outlets outside were used so had to snake a long extension for the power adapter. It Makes a tripping hazard and does not look good on our patio. I Have covered it now, but I wish it wasn't like that."
"4653","Frustrated with the high cost of cable and the little bit we do watch, I decided to try the Amazon firestick. After reading all the reviews I was curious if it was going to live up to the hype. After a few months of strickly using the stick, we have cancelled our cable and are saving over $100 a month! My boys love the alexa on the remote and use it all the time. I would highly recommend the firestick to anyone looking to dump cable."
"4654","I love the Fire TV Stick, with one exception, I am suffering with some audio drop outs when using Exodus. The remote app for IOS has some bugs and the keyboard is iffy. Still running checks but other than that it works well and gives me what I want 90% of the time which makes it worth the investment."
"4655","Everything is great except that Fire TV Stick does not accomodate the News On app which I used to watch all the time on Roku."
"4656","I'm having technical difficulties with my internet provider but when I get that squared away I'm sure the fire stick will work just fine."
"4657","Best thing I have purchased in a long time!"
"4658","I love this. It does everything I needed it to and more. After reading reviews I did as instructed and couldn't be happier."
"4659","What can I say except this is money in your pocket.  I went on youtube and added Kodi and I will never pay for cable again!"
"4660","Love this. We originally purchases the first FireTV that came out. It finally gave out. Moved on to the stick. Works great."
"4661","I really like the voice remote as it sure is easier than trying to sort through all the menus looking for a movie to watch."
"4662","A marvelous treat 9-- the ability to call up TV sessions to view. Thank you for creating FireStick with Alexa Voice Remote."
"4663","Easy to install and easy to use. I erroneously sent one back that was probably perfectly ok. The electrical outlet was faulty, not the Fire TV Stick. This is my second one. Good content and easy to navigate."
"4664","I love it when it works. This is the second one I've owned and they both have overheated and died within 1 yr of purchase, so make sure you buy it with a warranty plan. It makes it super easy to find movies, fast or turn my photos into a photo screensaver or play music. I will be buying it again, but with a SquareTrade warranty."
"4665","Had a ROKU for years. This is a bit better. Of course my ROKU is an older model. Love the addition of Alexa to the product."
"4666","I was amazed, this little Fire Stick works way beyond my expectation. Grate picture easy to setup and so far very reliable."
"4667","It's just ok. The Roku Stick is much better in my opinion. I ordered the Fire Stick to get DirecTV Now, but now that the Roku has added it, I wish I would have just ordered another one of those. The fire stick just doesn't have the ease of use that the Roku does."
"4668","Well worth the money.  I purchased this for our daughters tv in her room. We have the Fire TV. Very happy with the selection of channels on both units. Would recommend this to anyone who is thinking of cutting the cord."
"4669","It's okay... i have may first gen fire sticks and cannot figure out why amazon would remove the useful and simple feature of scaling the display so that the picture will fit the screen..."
"4670","Update 5/6/2017: I've been experiencing a lot of network connection issues recently. I also have a Roku that doesn't have any of these problems, so it must be the fire stick equipment.Love my firestick and am happy I made the purchase! However, recently it's been having trouble connecting to my wifi (all my other devices keep a strong connection). Its also disappointing that a lot of the tv apps can't be used without a subscription to cable. What's the point of cutting the cord if I can't use this to watch shows on abc, nbc, hgtv, etc without buying the most ridiculously expensive cable package. Rant over :)"
"4671","Does not seem to make a difference with buffering issues, the voice option is not working maybe it's me but the included documentation is very limited.  Also the menu format has changed without an option to keep the old one,  I perfer the old one, and the aspect ratio screen setting has been removed nothing about this in the description or news on the new device vs. 1st generation. Also you are limited to how many you can purchase,  I am returning mine."
"4672","I have been waiting to get this so I can call and cancel my cable subscription. Verybeasy to install and boot up. Experienced a couple buffering delays but nothing that I couldn't deal with. Also had 3 other people watching videos on iPads at the same time so I was actually amazed that it didn't act up more for the 8 straight hours I was streaming football games. Extremely happy with the product and will be buying a few more to scatter around the house."
"4673","Does what it is supposed to do. I turned off my Cable TV. Saving a few coins. I highly recommend firestick.The remote stopped working. Called tech support - great! Got it working quickly."
"4674","We love our amazon stick! It's a lifesaver to have the apps for our whole family. Getting rid of cable now and saving money!"
"4675","We've always had rokus as they had the spectrum/time warner cable app but we've since ditched them and switched to fire tv now that it's been integrated with the Alexa devices."
"4676","Up and running in minutes. World of new programming to watch for every age group or interest. Highly recommend this to all!"
"4677","My boyfriend and I love the Amazon fire stick! It makes me feel like I'm getting more use out of Amazon Prime music/movies/games that they offer for free. Plus I can now watch Netflix/Hulu on my tv instead of my tiny iPad screen. Alexa added into this product just makes it 10x's better!"
"4678","I had no idea how easy streaming could be until I got the Fire TV stick. The only complaint I have is that I cannot figure out how to delete trial APPs if I decide I don't want to buy them after the trial period. It should be easy to do without having to log on and figure it out online."
"4679","I LOVE IT!!  will reduce my monthly bills by over $120.00....easy to set up, a joy to use...highly recommend this product, and seller!"
"4680","Easy to install and operates smoothly. The voice feature is also nice and works well. I got tired of unlocking my phone to pause the show on my Chromecast."
"4681","My husband loves loves loves this !I do as well.When he first got it,I didn't see him for days he was catching up on Billions!"
"4682","I noticed a significant increase in response speed and playback on this version. I was and am a happy owner of the generation 2 however I always complained about how slow the apps loaded and menus took to scroll. This new version fixed all that with the quad core processor."
"4683","I had been using an alternative media center for a very long time, but after I fell in love with my Echo, I thought I might upgrade my entertainment system as well.  All of my apps work better than ever and with my Echo, I am enjoying hands-free playback.  If you are considering different methods to turn your TV to a SmartTV, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Fire TV stick.  If you have an Echo, don't even consider anything else."
"4684","Makes my TV a smart TV. Works well! Lots of great apps to stream from! We don't have cable but we have Netflix, Hulu and HBO and their apps work great on the Firestick. Plugs into the wall and into the back of your TV. Reminds me of using my friends apple TV but for a much cheaper price. Has an automatic shut-off. I have had it over a week and haven't used my computer to stream anything since. Personally I don't think you need a Fire TV for what this can do."
"4685","Started off a bit intermittent but after using a couple of times works great now.  Seamless operation with PlayStation Vue."
"4686","if you can describe with one word. What it will be, amazing in all aspects. the picture quality the movies that are available and all the apps."
"4687","I have a ""smart TV"" but this works much better.  Colors are better and I don't have to turn the volume way, way up to hear.  Also, I would frequently have buffering issues with the smart TV but very rarely with the Fire Stick.  A lot of content is accessible via the Fire Stick.  The only problem I had was that they are so popular that they sold out and are backordered."
"4688","I found this very easy to install, (5-10 minutes), once installed the instructions are very self explanatory. For those who may not be new generation savvy installation was a breeze. All the channels are on the home page and you just click on what you want. It has it all, I am in love with it. After the 1st order I placed a order for another and I received it in no time. I have since cancelled my premium cable and now have the basics because I watch the Fire Stick."
"4689","Works Good no problem with install but; No ""ON/OFF"" button so its always on then go's to sleep mode when not in use, and a lot of the apps you have to pay for with a subcribtion fee as well as being a Prime member... Overall good product if you don't have a Smart TV..."
"4690","It's Great & extremely easy to use. This is my 2nd one,  my 1st remote died out so I use the app, which is OK, I just wish that the firestick remotes were interchangeable."
"4691","Everything that was promised. This replaced an older one. It went in quickly. Installed with little or no problems. Works like a charm."
"4692","It does lock up now and then.  A restart or reboot will fix it.  Not real fond of the Hulu new format. It's a good choice overall. easy to install and operate."
"4693","Great value for streaming services already subscribed to. The only drawback is, as with other on-screen​ devices, is navigating a one at a time click keyboard."
"4694","These things are awesome.  what a great easy way to be able to watch shows via netflix, amazon prome, etc on a tv.  Setup was quick and painless."
"4695","I bought this for my non smart tv. I wanted both my tv's to have the capability to be smart tv's because I went cable tv free. The best choice I ever made. Wish I would have bought this sooner.  I do have amazon prime so that is helpful to watch movies. Also I like this much better than my smart tv."
"4696","Great little gadget.I can now get rid of some of those expensive satellite Chanel's. Would recommend to family and friends."
"4697","Awkward design with cable coming out of end and also needing the wired power cable but is a great device.Alexa hates me so I gave up using it. Was like having a conversation with a deaf parrot."
"4698","It would help with the set up if there were at least brief basic directions.There was plenty of help online and good video tutorials once you managed to get it installed."
"4699","Still learning to use the Fire Stick. We do not watch the Tv,  that much but it nice to have so many stations to choose from."
"4700","Everything you need to start streaming media, just plug it into a spare HDMI port on your TV, connect the power adaptor to it and you are good to go. Voice recognition is excellent.  Even with my Spanish accent, this amazing gadget was able to understand my commands. All in all I am very pleased with my purchase."
"4701","The desired item was optimally packaged and promptly delivered - an ideal transaction! This fine product is a great bargain."
"4702","I've bragged on this and three people have bought one, after seeing mine. I'm done with Charter and Directv. There's so much on this, that there's no way I can fully see or experience it all. It's overwhelmingly diverse. You add a ""build"" to it and can change whatever, is accessible, whenever. However, live tv is tough, except for sports. I watch NFL and NBA games relatively easy, with good quality. You have to find which sections work for you."
"4703","I wasn't sure how streaming would work for me considering I've used cable for 30+ years. I couldn't be happier with my Fire TV Stick with voice remote. It has made the transition from cable to streaming so very simple. The only problem I have now is trying to decide what to watch! One thing I do miss and I haven't figured out why it's not available and that is where is the OWN network?! Cable has lost a customer, I just wish I'd made the change sooner."
"4704","Easy set up & very entertaining. My 5 & 3 year old get a kick out of using Alexa. I don't necessarily like the Prime movie choices and you have to pretty much buy or rent the good ones. Installing apps like Kodi is an option, but I've heard Alexa won't work which is the whole point. Overall, it works as advertised...but you end up spending more money. If you watch a lot of movies and want to replace a cable bill with Fire...realistically it won't work."
"4705","Of all the technology gadgets out there...this is the easiest item to install.  I received the first one as a gift, and then ordered  two more for the somewhat outdated Television sets in my home. The Fire TV Stick is amazing.  Everything it is supposed to do, does happen.  We are enjoying additional movies, games for grandchildren, and just a good feeling about an item that seems to have no glitches...I would recommend this without reservation!!"
"4706","Love the new firestick it is definitely 2x as fast as the v1 firestick. It's noticeable and before I was unable to run the better Builds on Kodi like the  beast due to ram and cpu usage being low and buffering. Now it loads quick and handles anything I can throw at it. The video card is actually a 6 or 8 core even though the CPU is dual core. If you have a older firestick it is worth it to buy this one and sell or give the old one away. BIG DIFFERENCE!"
"4707","I really like the fire TV stick! I haven't tried out Alexa, but everything else works great. I love that you don't have to switch the tv to the input that the stick is on with the TV remote... you just click on the stick remote and it does it for you!"
"4708","I'm giving this 3 stars for two reasons:1. The first Fire Stick I was sent did not work at all. I'm pretty sure the remote was mislabeled and probably never worked. I also didn't realize until I received my second Fire Stick that the pieces should have been wrapped in plastic in the box. I have a feeling I was sent a refurbished or returned Fire Stick, which was a hassle to return to get a new one. I usually expect my items to be new unless otherwise speficified, so this was not a great start to my Fire Stick experience.2. My second Fire Stick worked as expected. However I really don't understand the purpose of the voice remote. When I ask it to search for a movie or tv show, 3/5 times it brings it up in IMDB, even if I'm in Hulu or Netflix when I search. So then I have to go back to the app and manually search for what I want to watch anyway. Why would IMDB be the default for a search? I don't want to buy the movie or tv show, I want to watch it through the subscription service I already pay for. So for the money this thing gets the job done, but it's not nearly as advanced as it pretends to be, per most Amazon electronics as I'm finding out."
"4709","So glad I purchased it. Was debating between this or Roku. I have Amazon prime so it was a no brainer.Wasn't sure about installation too. Turned out to be easy to install. Now I can watch my prime movies on my tv ISO my iPad."
"4710","Oh my gosh. I had the first gen Fire Stick which I thought was great. This Second Gen is even better. Took about 5 minutes to set up, the Alexa voice control is amazing. I've asked it to find everything from a certain movie, to weather to the closest Dominos Pizza in my area. Never fails. I have Prime, Hulu and Netflix and all three were instantly recognized by the Fire Stick and after I entered log-in data for each was up and running. Really a great device."
"4711","This is an amazing item, I had heard talk about it but had never thought that it was this good. The things you can do with the fire stick will blow your mind. I recommend for anybody that is tired of cable and/or fees buy the Fire Stick you'll be glad you did..."
"4712","The new fire stick is so easy to use and set up.  I love the way it seamlessly combines all of my streaming services together and searches them all at once.  This device makes it easy for everyone in the family to enjoy all the movies and TV shows plus the internet with a simple voice command.  This is instead of starting your particular streaming device and then searching manually for what you want.  All I can say to sum it up is quick, easy, and effective."
"4713","Given as a gift.  They LOVED it.  I don't have one so cannot speak of the details, only the recipient was going on and on."
"4714","Works great, I canceled our cox cable I love the fire stick but we had our special programmed to get everything imaginable"
"4715","This thing rocks, have Amazon video, Netflix, and YouTube.  Just installed Kodi on it and it is now supercharged! Amazing!"
"4716","I'm very pleased with my fire stick. There are so many movies and tv shows you can watch! You can even use workout videos!"
"4717","I love my new firestick. The only problem I had is the USB cord/power cord is not compatible with all sticks and/or TV 's."
"4718","We had one in another room.  This was for an additional unit.  Works well, still learning all the tricks, but good product!"
"4719","I'm still learning on this but so far so good. Sometimes Alexa doesn't quite know what I'm asking for so that's a little frustrating. I tried to put Kodi on the Firestick with help from a YouTube video. Didn't work so I've sent for a book on how to do this so I can have some free channels and try to get rid of cable. I do love that I have all my downloaded music that I put on my tablet now on the Firestick. That is awesome and so worth the money just to have that."
"4720","Finally a reason to cut cable and trim the fat. Thank you Amazon. This this is amazing, I don't know why I waited so long."
"4721","The Fire TV Stick works as described.  I can watch all my Prime movies on my TV in HD.  Easy to use with a lot of options."
"4722","I am addicted to this! Streaming is much better than through the smart tv. I use it for Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Video and HBO GO and streaming is very good and I don't have a fast internet connection."
"4723","It was sad that our old fire stick died a premature (I feel) death, but the new one picked up where the old one left off. Since we mainly use it with Netflix, the voice command hasn't been used very much. It might make it worth trying the prime content again."
"4724","Excellent Amazon Fire Product. These fire sticks are awesome and they do it all! Priced right and designed extremely well."
"4725","It's making life easier on us. No more searching web on smart tv. It was a torture typing in letter with a remote control."
"4726","Especially with apps designed for the Fire TV stick, the performance for the price is exceptional. I am quite pleased with it."
"4727","Super easy to install and I am getting the hang of navigating with it. I hope to add Amazon Prime to my Netflix programs soon!"
"4728","Just installed it yesterday.  Easy installation, fast, and complete.  I really like Alexa and its voice features.  Love it."
"4729","I don't really care for the fact that the fire stick has to be plugged in all the time which means you have an ugly wire hanging on the side of your TV."
"4730","i bought on line for sale of 29$ and it worked for one night and then would not connect to wifi with very strong signal.  and the other i purchased  fred meyer for 39$ and still in use with no problems. the defective one was easy to return and i received my refund as stated."
"4731","Great purchase. Still have cable. Ultimate goal is to eliminate that outrageous bill when NOTHING is ever on.Lost the remote, Auntie told me about the app. Happy camper."
"4732","Only disappointment was having to plug the stick in.  Other than that I was pleased with it.  Offered alternative content to the the roku"
"4733","Loved this so much I bought another for another TV.  Super easy to use. No more having to stream through an old DVD player."
"4734","So I purchased the Fire Stick to ""cut the cord"" and I am more than delighted. Left my cable provider that was charging $70 per month for 220 channels that I don't watch to Sling TV that has 52 channels that I do watch for $30. Interface on the Fire Stick is easy and I have experienced no buffering or digital artifacts in the video streams.Highly recommend!"
"4735","Received timely, easy install and works as expected. No issues and I recommend. Only question I have is I ordered one about 4 - 5 wks ago for a sale price of $29.99 just like this one BUT the one I received first was not a Alexa voice activated model....it wasn't advertised as one, just wondering...I guess I just missed the cut off point for Black Friday...both versions work fine for me and I really don't expect to use the voice activation so I am not mad."
"4736","The bulk of my experience has been with Roku and ran with a smart Android device for a few months before getting this.  This is definitely better than the Android device and pretty close to the Roku as far as performance.  The reason for four stars is because I've found it needs to be restarted every few days or it really starts to lag.  Other than that, it's great.  Now, if only the Amazon Prime Video could take some lessons on layout, access, etc. from Netflix . . ."
"4737","I love my new Firestick! I don't have a computer or a smart TV so this works so well for me to watch movies, listen to music, etc."
"4738","I will say that we had been using Roku devices when I ordered the Fire Stick.  I found this device to be much slower in all aspects of operation than the comparable Roku device. I did like the ability to fast forward and rewind better than the Roku. But in all other features I found the Fire Stick to be more cumbersome.  I found it harder to change between applications, harder to find a particular program within the applications, and harder to move around.  I did not use the Alexa function. This may have solved some of these problems but because of the slow responses I failed to see how using voice commands would've made it faster."
"4739","The fire stick is a great addition to a TV. It allows for a variety of viewing options, including movies via Prime, videos using Youtube, Netflix (and many other subscription and fee based apps) all built-in. The new interface is easy to use and the set-up is straight forward (allow for approximately 15 minutes to set-up). The only negative I have is the user interface when typing or keying in a movie title. Otherwise, the Fire Stick is a definite go."
"4740","Like the idea but basically you still can't watch anything and what you can watch (for free)Is not something you Want toWatch... and if you happen to find something it'll only be a few episodes ..i get it, every one wants a piece of the pie.. but I'm sure you could throw in something  ""good""  to watch for free.  And I'm  sure you know what is ""good"" ,  i specifically would like something from the Disney channel for my kids."
"4741","I can't complain about the quality of the video.  I primarily use this with the PlayStation Vue app we're loading of the program guide is slow"
"4742","I don't use the voice commands very much but when I do it works perfectly it is really hard to believe that they have so many features on such a small device pretty cool."
"4743","My son in law had to install the apps, and the remote seems like it is always loosing sync or contact with the fire-stick."
"4744","This is my second fire stick. I bought this one because I really liked the first one so much. Plus my wife stored the first one for herself."
"4745","I love my firestick! There's so much to do with it especially if you jailbreak it and get Kodi! I love the voice search with Alexa feature, it's a very nice touch!"
"4746","As advertised.  Delivery was prompt.  Item was easy to set-up, even for an old non-techie.  Works great. I would positively recommend this item."
"4747","Have got it for a while and it disconnects from WiFi network from time to time. I have to restart it to fix the issue and it happens a lot frequent recently. Other than that, this is a good product."
"4748","I would have upgraded to this along time ago if I would have known how much better the experience would be over the original."
"4749","I must have pushed a 1 button  purchase. My INTERNET has been DOWN since MARCH 01, 2016. Also, I don't have a SMART TV--both ítems are necessary for FIRE TV to work. Am I correct???"
"4750","Cable will soon go the way of the dinosaur. Wish I had bought this earlier. If you are a Prime member it's a must have. So get Prime and get a fire stick."
"4751","I'm disappointed that in order to work the way you want you have to download programs and they don't give any suggestions"
"4752","One of the best designed remotes I have ever used.  Don't use the voice because the item is so very easy to use manually."
"4753","Anytime I can save money from using cable, etc. I'm for it! Thank you Fire TV Stick.  I supposed I should turn on Alexa?!"
"4754","Really enjoy using this.  Easy to install and easy to use and so much faster than another brand we were previously using."
"4755","Worked as expected and is quick for such a small device.The one thing that bothered me was that Amazon auto enrolled me for prime and hit my credit card for $100 with no notice just by downloading a free app from their store.  Had to call customer service to get the charge reversed.Other than that little learning experience,  I have been very pleased with the device and will most likely buy another as well."
"4756","Alexa is amazing. Instant response for everything. Is much quicker than scolling through menus, and Alexa's response & answers can be quite humorus & entertaing at times. Almost like having another person in the room. The range of the remote is very good and I can control playing music from other rooms. Nice to be in another room and say ""pause"" to silence the music when answering the phone. A great product. I ordered a 2nd one the very next day."
"4757","Exactly as advertised. Setup was a snap. Purchased primarily for use on an old TV in the bedroom that is connected to cable but has no set-top box. The Firestick has expanded the content available probably tenfold. Pictures are crisp, no buffering, sound is perfectly synced. The Alexa remote is pretty sharp - I don't have to consciously attempt to clearly enunciate what I want the unit to do. Added the android app as an alternative remote and it works just as well."
"4758","I replaced my older model fire stick with this updated model. I'm very pleased with the added features especially the Alexa Voice Remote. My only disappointment was that in my rush to upgrade I forgot that the holiday sales would be starting a few days after I placed my order.  If I had waited I could have saved $15.00.  Since it is listed as a ""deal"" I was not able to get the price difference refunded."
"4759","I have only had the Fire TV Stick a short time so I am still working on my learning curve. I am having issues with the movies or shows downloading as fast as I am viewing. I may need to up my internet speed but am working on the problem. I was under the impression that my internet speed was sufficient for downloading. I am still working on that. I also am trying to acclimate to the control stick to fit my need."
"4760","I love this thing so much, I bought a second one.  Works exactly as described.  I love watching movies with this.  I have a Roku and didn't find it as user friendly."
"4761","Item delivered quickly.  Real easy set up.  Instructions were well written.  The Alexa voice remote worked better than expected, and makes the search for whatever much quicker.  I am an Amazon Prime Video user so the on screen layout was very friendly.  A little more difficult to find anything that was not amazon, but overall very safisfied."
"4762","I like it especially having prime that I bought it for a second tv and probably a third. I was able to upload several cd's of music to be able to access it also."
"4763","I really like it however when streaming movies is a delay on the sound I thought it was my cable but when switch to Apple TV it doesn't happen ?? Just  wondering"
"4764","GREAT PRODUCT! 10 STARS! GOOD QUALITY AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY HOW FAST THIS IS ON HIGH SPEED INTERNET! INCREDIBLE!!! 2 DAY PRIME SHIPPING! VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!"
"4765","I find it ok. not all the apps i would like to see are there, but worst of all immediately after the update Alexa voice control stopped working.The loading is slower than other streaming devices and when you search something in the main page it shows you the results and where you can watch them but then, when you open the app you have to start the search from the scratch. Now that in the household we also have the ps4 we dont use the stick anymore."
"4766","It's way faster than the first Fire TV Stick. It actually plays HBO Go, unlike the first gen one which always skips and stops. It seems HBO has a really poor implementation that causes the older device to fail a lot of the time, but since I got this new stick, I've had zero issues with the HBO Go app. The voice search is really convenient as well. Definitely worth the upgrade. I can barely sense any delay when I'm scrolling around and loading videos."
"4767","Fire TV Stick is a great add on for older flat screens. Or TV's that do not have the ""Smart"" capabilities!! Just a little too expensive for me."
"4768","After five days of use I love the fire stick and its streaming capabilities with my amazon prime membership.  Only problem I have experienced is a network connection problem when streaming Sling TV.  My research indicates it is a common problem with the network being connected but showing a problem with the network.  Will continue to troubleshoot and hope a tech solution is put in place soon!"
"4769","Love it! Fire TV was perfect for what we were looking for.  We have our TV hung on the wall in our living room and the satellite box and wires all run through the wall in to the basement.  I needed a remote that would work even though the streaming device would be located in the basement.  It works perfectly!  Now I can stream Netflix so our children can watch their favorite shows and movies."
"4770","Absolutely love it, even though the reviews express lag time between the remote and Fire Stick I have yet to experience any lag. Currently I have the device located behind my Yamaha Receiver and in a cabinet and still no issues to date. Picture quality is HD and audio is right on que. Highly recommend over any other device that I've used, side note I have six tv's, best connection hands down!"
"4771","This is the greatest kodi stick I have ever kodi stuck. Kodi kodi kodi kodi. You will love this, you can get games like the shark game. Watch walking dead for free. And kodi."
"4772","I had the previous, non-voice version and this one is much improved. The interface is easier to use and my wife likes the voice function. Would buy again."
"4773","I absolutely love this Fire Stick. I have full access to anything i want to watch. I installed kodi on it and i didn't  jailbrake it which is awesome because I honestly do not like to jailbrake anything. Alexa is so awesome she understands me about 95% of the time which is actually super impressive. The initial set up was so easy, and i love the fact that i can transfer it from my room to the living room without having issues. Seriously worth every penny"
"4774","Perfect !!"
"4775","Better than Roku, It pulls from all apps. Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Then you choose which to watch it on. Plus you get Alexa."
"4776","Great for movies and TV shows.  Wish there were more options for live-streaming news, weather, etc.  You need to buy subscriptions to other services to get the most out of it, but it's worthwhile, and a good option to move away from cable."
"4777","Potential to be 5 Stars, but closed captioning capabilities are either poor or not intuitive.Pure Flix and Feeln are fine on Roku, but not on the Fire Stick.Only reason it got 3 stars was the ease of projecting YouTube from my iPad. YouTube allows you to set the captioning."
"4778","I don't know why we waited so long to purchase this product! We love our firestick-- it's easy to use and worth every penny! We cancelled our cable service and will never go back!"
"4779","I absolutely love this! I can use it for my Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, FOX, NBC, etc, easy to set up and easy to use."
"4780","Awesome!!! I love the Alexa voice remote. I also have the 1st generation Fire TV stick and this one is noticeably faster."
"4781","We received this on time and have enjoyed using it. I must say Alexa understands 10 times better than Siri on my iPhone. We have been watching several Amazon series and listening to music. It was easy to connect."
"4782","Went through a roku and apple tv until I got this.  Controlled by Alexa and has been the most error free out of them all."
"4783","It worked but while I was learning it, I installed a password so as not to accidently be charged unknowingly. I was slowly learning while keeping comcast. I since lost the PIN. On the screen it says to sign in to Amazon acct. I did but nowhere is there any answers. I cannot use it right now an seeking help !!!!"
"4784","So much better than paying for cable.  Don't know if it's just me or not, but we don't always have the best service.  Wonder if it's our internet provider, but it cuts out and then freezes so we can't watch the rest of the show we were on.  Would recommend this to anyone though.  Saves a bunch of money a month!"
"4785","Firestick has chromecast and other devices of this nature beat in every way imaginable. Super simple to setup and use. If you can operate a smartphone you can easily setup and use a firestick. My 8 year old daughter was able to pick up the remote and figure it out with very little instructions on how to use it."
"4786","I am very pleased with the FireTV Stick.  You have to know how to follow the directions and you have to know your connections which can be tricky but we have watched several of the shows.  So far we have watched the free Amazon Prime shows and find them very entertaining."
"4787","I am loving the fire stick. It's easy to use and installed it myself at 68. I haven't mastered Alexa yet but working on it."
"4788","This is fantastic. My three month free movie channels is coming to an end and I am not renewing it because this serves all our needs."
"4789","What a fun way to keep cool and happy thru this week of triple digit temps and dirty air. Fire TV Stick equals never a boring moment."
"4790","WONDERFUL and even 65 year old grand parents can figure out how to use the thing:):)Still so much to learn but loving Alexa!!!!"
"4791","We purchased one a couple of months ago, and we liked it so much that we ordered another.  These things are great and a real bargain.  They are fast, buffer very well, and the remote is also great."
"4792","The best thing ever. I like the size and weight on this fire stick. The product was not available when I purchased it. I think there was a 10 day wait. After 6 days, they emailed me to let me know that the product is now available and ready for shipping so I got it earlier than expected. The voice remote work great (btw I have an accent). Love this product."
"4793","I'm very disappointed.  The stick is too long to fit in the space where the HDMI port is within the area of my Samsung 55"" LED tv sits. There is an edge around the tv that protrudes and the fire stick is approximately an inch too long to fit between that and the port.  I can only use it on my bedroom tv so I can't use it for company or for watching most of the time since our living room is the most utilized room in the house."
"4794","So much fun! Very easy to set up and use. You need wifi enabled t.v. and it just seems neat to talk to Alexa. I watched Amazons' video before I purchased, and it's a breeze to set up and watch your shows."
"4795","I recently ""cut the cord"".  I got a Fire TV box for my main TV and this Fire TV stick for a second TV.  These are exactly what I was looking for at very reasonable prices.  The processing speed is good and streaming is as reliable as your wireless service.  Very pleased so far."
"4796","Goes along with my review of the FIRE BOX. Would recommend it for any one wanting to cut the cord on cable or the Satellite."
"4797","My son bought  this for us. It is great. We cancelled our Dish and got Directv Now, saving us about $100. a month and we have a lot more choices of what to watch. It is taking me awhile to learn this new electronics era.You can teach an old dog new tricks."
"4798","Love all three of them, so much on the fire sticks, music, movies, sports, live tv, and they have Alexa voice, and very easy to operate, very cool...just ask and Alexa does it, want to know the weather anywhere just ask."
"4799","The hardest thing about hooking up the fire stick was getting the remote back off to insert the batteries. Very easy after that!"
"4800","I returned item because it is not what i thought it would be, did not fit my needs.I gave 5 stars for customer service by excepting my return and refunding me promptly."
"4801","It's a good ecosystem with plenty of streaming apps and the Bluetooth remote works well. However, if you have a fire TV box you will notice massive lag loading things. The stick is just too underpowered. It's slow, laggy and that becomes painfully obvious when you have the better fire TV box. My advice, spend the extra 50 bucks and get the fire TV box. You get so much more."
"4802","We switched from Roku to the firestick and am in love with it so far. You can download so much more than you can a roku."
"4803","Awesome, I had the first model Fire TV Stick.just thought I'd upgrade to a newer Fire Stick and might I say its awesome."
"4804","We already have a Media player on one T.V.,, so we needed a fire stick for the bedroom T.V., they both are fantastic, the voice command is great."
"4805","I'm so glad we finally ditched our Apple TV and moved to the Fire TV Stick (or Fire Stick as it's known in our house!). Everything works perfectly, the voice commands are always spot on, and you have the ability to add solid apps like Plex for a movie server interface, which I highly recommend. I was a bit hesitant after some so-so experiences with our kids' Fire tablets, but this is a great value that I expect we'll have around for quite some time!"
"4806","If you don't have a smart tv this is a great option.  Love how simple it is to use.  Have no need to order anything online with it or use the voice commands but thebtv aspect is great."
"4807","Way better than the original. The Alexa voice controls are great, too. Set up is just as easy as the original and for streaming, the apps are amazing. We're huge Flash fans in our household and have direct access to the CW in HD is amazing for watching the episode the day after it airs.The Remote app is easily the best way to use the stick, as it has the virtual keyboard, but the new remote is fantastic as well!Overall, it's a solid product and fast."
"4808","Where's STARZ  Unless you by it through Amazon no access.  Other than that very good."
"4809","Great product!!!!  If your router is not within 5 feet of your tv then you will need to purchase a ""WiFi range extender"" to receive good signal. You can buy these at Walmart for $39.95.Without the WiFi extender you won't get a strong signal and the shows and movies that you are watching will take several minutes to load."
"4810","recommend over roku, works beter than the installed hardware on my smart tv. as advertised"
"4811","I purchased the new Fire Stick with Alexa... Great Purchase! Firstly, I ordered from Amazon Prime Now.... Gotta love 2 hour delivery. I'm the perfect person to have to set this up. I'm blind; if I can setup without assistance... Most others should not have an issue. I set this unit up without directions. Very clear where each piece attached. After unit powered up, the complete setup was less than 10 minutes. Your account already programmed to the Fire stick. The remote and functionality is pretty self explanatory... However, Amazon did also have quick -start guide online. For my fellow blind consumers... This is as easy to use as Apple TV. The screen reader that Amazon uses is called Voice View. You will not have issues navigating. I even setup without assistance. Voice View is turned on by pressing the Back and Menu buttons at same time. These are the first and third button on first row of three buttons. Their is also an easy to follow help article from Amazon online. As for the actual product... I couldn't be happier. Only time will tell if it's a quality product. For $40., if I get a couple years... Great!! I do have one recommendation after using for a few days. The unit gets hot when used for a long period of time. Does not affect the device function. However, I would unplug from wall outlet when not in use. The Stick doesn't seem to have venting for the processor. Unplugging gives unit time to cool. Which should prolong the life of your Fire Stick!"
"4812","Yes it does what is claimed. Does run slow at start up but could be my wifi. How ever the battery life in the remote is non existent. Maybe a USB type charger ?"
"4813","Love this!  I'm addicted to Amazon.  I confess and I'm not ashamed.  This was easy to install and I've had zero problems!  Would definitely recommend."
"4814","Easy to use. Lots of free apps and channels. Neat interface with your phone to use as a remote.  Better than chromecast!"
"4815","If you have Prime this is a real great tool for watching the prime content.  Easy to set up and use. Really enjoying it."
"4816","We had an HD roku, so not one of the newest ones, but we still love the Fire stick. I'm so glad we upgraded, it works great."
"4817","I just absolutely love my Fire TV stick. I am truly addicted to it and all of it's content. It's too bad that I have to sleep sometimes because I could watch it 24/7/365. It is that good !  :)"
"4818","With a few applications added on and computer-wise grand-daughter ,we are more than happy. No more expensive television/movie channel service thru cable-satellite providers. The Fire-stick payed for itself in less than 10 days. We watch what we want, when we want,so convenient."
"4819","Having the fire stick is almost like converting your regular tv into a smart tv. You can have apps, music, movies, you name it! I love how you can hook up your amazon account to it as well. For anyone who mostly watches netflix and hulu like me, this is definitely worth it for the price you pay. I also love how it is so portable. I  have already taken it on a few vacations and that has allowed me to watch my own movies on the tv's in my hotel rooms!"
"4820","So much easier than Roku, and the choice of apps is great!"
"4821","I like it, but would have given 5 stars, but my package didn't have a extender cable in the box(Packaging said one was included) and my TV only had two HDMI ports and the Fire Stick is too wide to fit, so I had to go out and purchase a extension cable for $14 at best buy"
"4822","I've tried to like my Amazon All-New Fire TV Stick for maybe 3 weeks now. The Alexa Voice feature is lovely. However the content is not what I expected.  I found no 'real time' programming, cable channels, which I expected from reading its description. Movies are abundant, which is nice; however, any programs from cable stations are old videos. Also I feel it should have come with a manual, which I saw for SALE, instead of the little folder it came with."
"4823","I had a first generation Fire TV Stick without voice and liked it fine. Having received this version for Christmas, I quickly learned to enjoy the voice command. Rather than manually scrolling through menu layers to find what I wanted, now I simply ask for the movie or app that I want, and it's up and running!Request for the future: allow Echo to control the Fire TV Stick functions. At this point, you must use the included voice remote."
"4824","I was trying to find an alternative to cable TV because no one wants to pay $300 for television.  I kept hearing everyone talking about this fire TV stick and how it beats cable, so I decided to give it a try and cable is a thing of the past in my house. There's tons of things to watch, I can connect my Netflix and Hulu accts and it's tons of add ons as well. I'll never pay $300 for cable again and I have no regrets. I've even had my mom order one."
"4825","You get so much for what you paid for, I received my first one as a gift and I loved it so much I bought a second one for my room. My daughter was really impressed with the item that she is planning on buying one as well. On the drawback side, it does take a while to figure out how to download the different apps and we do have streaming problems from time to time. Not sure if that's my internet or the device. Still pretty happy with the fire stick."
"4826","I have purchased this 2nd gen firetv stick after my 1st gen one would not turn on. This is way faster in loading titles and much quicker in UI response. I was debating myself to either go for FireTV box or stick, but after reading some reviews I decided to go with the stick as it is much cheaper and 2nd gen stick is much faster than the 1st gen. I think it is worth the price. Moreover Alexa voice remote is included in the box which is a sweet deal."
"4827","I am really enjoying using the Fire TV Stick.  Unfortunately, they may not be available any longer. What is up with that?"
"4828","Works great,  but it goes to sleep and doesn't wake up.  It's a real pain to move the television and unplug it over and over."
"4829","It meets my standards but I can't get Vudu on here that's my only complaint if I can't get the Vudu app then what good is this thing other than that everything is fine just hope that they come out with better situation than this sometimes I think that these contractions they improved throughout time I would recommend this to someone three stars that's all you get get me the Vudu app and it'll go up to 5 stars"
"4830","Came across 2 issues within 2 months of purchase:Remote isn't working as of now. Downloaded the app and using fire tv with android appAt another instance firetv was restating by itself continuously. Not sure whether it has anything to do with a faulty remote?"
"4831","This is a great product Alexa works nicely it is a bit slower than the fire tv which is expected but there is one issue I am having my remote does not always work I have to hit buttons multiple times before the fire stick recognizes that I have hit a button otherwise it would be a 5 star"
"4832","Well I hate to write my first somewhat negative review of a Amazon device, we own kindles, kindle fire and an older firestick so I figured getting a second one that had alexa for the kitchen TV would be a no brainer.  Still playing with Alexa but think its ok and the stick seems to work fine for prime tv Netflixs and most of the apps.  Then I tried to set up my Pandora again that I have on other devices.  The app starts but never runs to play music, tried all the amazon trouble shooting with out luck called support was referred to Pandora who punted back to Amazon.  So after 3 calls to amazon got a very helpful tech who listened instead of cutting and pasting canned messages and he confirmed that the Pandora app is not working with firestick and escalated the ticket.  Now 3 days later we are back to canned messages about clear the cache reload the app etc etc.  I can understand if lower use apps are not tested but the big ones like Pandora Netflix etc that are in the app store on amazon should work.  I will give it a few more days and return if they cant fix it."
"4833","My rating is actually 4.75 stars but since they don’t have that I gave the five… I only wish the capacity was slightly more otherwise it’s a wonderful item that every household should have, and personally I have FOUR!!!"
"4834","This is a great product for the price.  I am not sure why my Prime 2 day shipping took 5 days, though.  I was disappointed in that.  Easy set up and great picture.  No bufferring.  I was also a bit surprised to see all the content that requires a purchase. Prime members don't get as much free content as I had thought I would. Overall, we are really enjoying it though, and it adds to our entertainment quite a bit, as before we had only had an antenna."
"4835","This is a cool little device; it turns your TV into a smart TV for 40 bucks. Not bad.  HOWEVER, while the product is functional, the Amazon software that's on it leaves a lot to be desired.  it's a total organizational mess and frustrating to use.  My suggestion, hire some people that know something about optimizing user interface designs."
"4836","I love the firestick. The integration with Amazon prime is fabulous! The game apps keeps my daughter occupied when there's down time. Netflix app works great. We ditched cable for this and I wouldn't look back! Definitely a good investment and worth the savings getting rid of cable."
"4837","A friend of mine said I need to get the stick rather than buying a new Rokuie and I am so very glad I took his advise this is far better than Rokue  I'm verry happy with this product. Amazon you scored again and I would highly recomend it."
"4838","Great interface for TV and music so far. I really won't be using it much until we cut the cord soon. As always, Amazon products rock."
"4839","This product is an awesome step in the right direction if you are going to cut the cord. I do recommend Sling TV with it if you are in to TBS, ESPN. HGTV etc. My wife loved having the Hallmark Channel (I did not) but it is a separate app on this device which is a pay to play app."
"4840","I love this. I am new at using one. I have only had it a little while but I would definitely recommend that you get it."
"4841","Works great.. Another source for watching movies as a Prime member .  Still trying to figure out whats available though"
"4842","Move over Roku, the Fire Stick has taken over.  I travel a lot and this is fantastic when at hotels with good internet."
"4843","Bought this for my boyfriend as a gift and he absolutely loves it!  He enjoys watching so many of his shows and movies."
"4844","I find the Amazon Fire stick to be a wonderful item and I like the capability of using my voice to control what it does"
"4845","Very Good. Very fast Gives me access to amazon video lightning fast. I already ordered another one for the living room."
"4846","Easy setup, love that it can go from tv to tv. We have one TV that doesn't have cable on it and it works great on the for when guests come over."
"4847","Can you say Kodi? As if this Fire Stick wasn't great enough, being able to use developer apps is over the top! Love it!"
"4848","I love this unit. I take it with me on my seasonal trips to Myrtle Beach and it provides all of the services I rely on."
"4849","There was what I expected.  AND THEN THERE WAS WHAT IT DELIVERED!  OMG I don't know why i didn't get this years sooner."
"4850","I thought that I had to get the $150 Apple TV to have the best experience with something like this but the Fire TV stick is JUST as good, if not better in my opinion. I used to have Apple TV until my roommate moved out and was looking for a cheap replacement. It's so worth it! No complaints at all and love that it's so tiny"
"4851","Prior to ordering, I continuously heard great things about the firestick. My husband continued to hound me to get one for months and cancel our satellite.  Finally I bought it and it has EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. I will be cancelling our satellite tv and will save 150$ a month. Thank u Amazon!😁"
"4852","I received this today.  It was purchased solely to use with BeachBody On Demand.Amazon says it is not compatible.  I am not sure if this is on BB or Amazon.  Either way I have help tickets issued (as both companies say it is compatible.Seems awesome other than that issue."
"4853","We have multiple.  Make sure you have a high speed internet and it will be seemless.  I have replaced roku's with this."
"4854","We love it. It works great. I would recommend this to others. The voice remote finds what we ask if it is actually there to find. I'm very happy with this product."
"4855","Love the Fire TV Stick.  It was easy to install and even easier to operate.  Streams all my Amazon Prime shows and Netflix."
"4856","This works great. I like it so much better than my Ruku. I have an Amazon Alexa and this works well to give it a command when I'm in a room without an echo dot"
"4857","I probably waited too long to get a fire stick.  I only have a projector (not a TV) and this worked great.  I hooked it up with a blue tooth speaker and have never looked back!  Amazon keeps providing value over and over.  Great product!"
"4858","This is the way of the future. Have decided that number of HDMI ports on any new TV will be an important consideration."
"4859","Excellent product. Works as advertised. We are new to Fire Stick, so we are working our way through learning how to use it. So far, we are very pleased."
"4860","I LOVE this!  I think I love it even more than my AppleTV.  Compact, easy to set up and SO many choices.  It's great to have all of the media services in one tiny package.  Still exploring ways in which to stream from different sources, but overall, a great, solid product!"
"4861","Been using two of these hard for all of our viewing and tv needs since December when we cut cable. Changed our lives and wallets!"
"4862","I love this device! I was initially skeptical: I plug this in to the TV and an outlet to watch Prime movies? YES! That is exactly how it works. It goes to ""sleep"" when you change your output on the TV. It even has a series of pictures it shows when you pause a movie and take too long to resume (without changing outputs). I highly recommend this device. The remote is simple, and I have not experienced any problems in terms of loading speed."
"4863","This Amazon Stick is a very good product and it has a faster streaming capability then any others devices in the market."
"4864","Love this!!!  Didn't use the voice feature after the newness wore off but Love the Fire Stick for those TV's that don't have wifi."
"4865","The Simplicity of the remote is refreshing. I totally enjoy the fire stick. Much better technology then running the Blu-ray player for streaming video. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants to turn there TV into an internet-ready TV. Just plug the fire stick into an HDMI port hook up the power supply and you're ready to go. Very fast on Startup and loading programs. Plus the screensaver has beautiful pictures. The voice searching works extremely well."
"4866","So far, I'm not impressed.  I received my Firestick last Thursday, opened and installed it on Friday, and by Saturday, the remote was dead.  I used the brand new batteries that came with the device.  I tried other new batteries that I had around the house.  Nothing.  I troubleshooted it using their recommendations.  Nothing.  Called the customer service center three times, who again all walked me through the troubleshooting despite telling them that I had already done it.  Nothing.  They are sending me a replacement remote but they are back logged so I won't receive it, at the earliest, until next week.  Yes, I know I can use the app remote in my phone but find it cumbersome.  Additionally, the very reason I purchased this device as opposed to some of the competing devices isbbecause of the separate remote.  I don't want my kids having my phone.  I've been incredibly let down so far."
"4867","Easily the best way to watch streaming media..  The price can't be beat and the sheer amount of stuff you can watch is mind numbingly awesome.. I would highly recommend this product to anybody.. Just buy a regular tv. Save the money and use the amazon fire stick to add the ""smart"" that you need..  Also the fact that it also uses the 5 ghz band as well as the 2.5 is awesome..  Really.. It's worth it.."
"4868","From DirecTV to Firestick effortlessly and happily-- especially for the hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in annual savings.  Go with Firestick!"
"4869","just so happens this is my second fire stick the remote stopped working on my first i called for replacement , so I went on and bought another one too , so I'll have a second one.So within this little time now the remote to the second fire stick has went out...Bummer!!!"
"4870","A smart person would make a micro usb splitter that can charge from a usb hub that is connected as a host.  But the main reason it loses stars is that the headphone on the controller is not supported on the Fire Stick 2.  Spent too much time on that for a full review.  Alexa is spotty; allows you to add to some shopping list, but no way to remove without another device.  Too much time locking down, not enough time innovating.  New software should improve things."
"4871","Love my Fire TV Stick. It was easy to install and I have an amazing picture quality and no extra wires snaking around my house."
"4872","push the button and the channels change. the circular 'button' is convenient as it easily allows for quick navigation. Not much to say other than it works."
"4873","I like having the opportunity to access my Amazon account and watch some shows and movies.I am a Prime member,  so was quite disappointed in the small selection of FREE movies and TV shows."
"4874","So far I am really enjoying this.  Set up was a breeze. I had purchase something similar in the past and it gave me nothing but trouble from the start.  This has been so easy that I am overjoyed."
"4875","My first time with this , it take a little getting used to it but I think this is better than paying rental for a cable box to watch tv on different sets. One time  purchase then it's all good.  Saves me almost $200 a year in box rental ,fees and taxes. And it belongs to me."
"4876","I just received this product and read some reviews that I did not particularity like but decided to try it anyway and it seems to be working great, I do believe the reviews I read must have been from people with slower internet"
"4877","Was unable to log in with most apps , to my cable service provider so rendered the apps useless. I don't know if the restriction comes from amazon or some. Place else ! I can easily log into same app from my phone and watch TV."
"4878","I love having this Firestick! I don't watch enough TV to pay for cable. With the firestick I can watch Netflix, HBO Now or listen to pandora. The best part is all the Amazon Videos and movies.Great purchase for the price."
"4879","I've been using the YouTube App, Amazon Video, HULU trial and eventually the NETFLIX trail. It has some games such as Crossy Road and Pacman. The Voice search is a great thing to have."
"4880","Love it! Set-up is simple. Picture is clear. I just cut the cable and have big savings because of it. One of the best purshases I have ever made!"
"4881","The item was what I ordered but I am having a few issues with programming.  It is not the item or the supliers fault.  100% my fault but not totally happy.  Knowing what I know now I would have not purchased this item."
"4882","Great item if you dont have amazon prime. My mother doesnt want prime and she loves this because she can download more apps adn movies but I have prime and it has all of the same shows/movies prime has."
"4883","I received my Fire Stick on October 7, 2017 and I have had to replace the batteries in the remote twice and the remote had already died again.  The remote seems to be defective and needs to be replaced."
"4884","I love my fire stick. I was not a believer until I actually purchased it and used it. You can definitely cut your monthly cable bill with this. I called my cable provider and downscaled by package. If you pick the right apps, you may even be inclined to cut your cable all together."
"4885","It took me a long time to consider going from cable to streaming TV, but with rising prices from my cable provider, the decision was straightforward. I received my Fire TV Stick after a few weeks because it was on backorder, obviously due to high demand. I plugged it into the HDMI-Side port on my Vizio M650VSE smart TV with the HDMI extender cable because the Fire TV Stick would not fit in the space available otherwise. Once it powered up, it looked for the remote which it recognized quickly by pushing on the Home button. I was concerned that my WIFI signal might not be strong enough based on the location of my router but the Fire TV Stick found my router right away and prompted me to connect with it. Once connected to the WIFI and  checking for updates the unit was ready to go. Navigating the Amazon home page left me overwhelmed with the amount of content available online.  I can see where one can run up their streaming fees if not careful when selecting from the content being offered."
"4886","Thought it would be a stick that did not require to be plugged into the wall, my main purpose for purchasing this was so I could avoid having to plug into an outlet as my TV is mounted above a fireplace and wanted to avoid having to take down, as well as get an outlet splitter. It pretty much has a cell phone charger attached to it.Other than that, all good!"
"4887","Bought one for each of our 3 TV's and are enjoying music and shows we cannot get otherwise.  Not too hard to figure out."
"4888","This is undoubtedly the greatest thing since sex. It really is a great pleasure to use and I recommend it to everyone."
"4889","Lost my first fite stick when I moved. Love the new fire stick with voice. Awesome is all I can say. Highly recommend."
"4890","Made for a great gift for my mom. She really likes the versatility of it ease of connecting Amazon applications to it."
"4891","Love this thing. I Spend more time watching programming through this than my cable. Everything I need is in one place."
"4892","I have the Fire TV box in the den and enjoy watching movies, so I bought the Fire stick for the bedroom. I enjoy both."
"4893","Works pretty good, only issue is occasionally picture but no sound, only way to correct it is to reboot the firestick."
"4894","Dead easy to use; far prefer to Roku, and easier to use, in some ways, than Apple.  Consider this -- an extreme value."
"4895","Sweet product. Its even sweeter if you know or learn how to expand its features via add-ons. My only complaint is the power cord that comes with the device. If you don't have a powered usb port and need to power it via outlet the cable is relatively short. Definitely buy this."
"4896","I love my Fire Stick. In the past, I streamed through my DVD, which offered few selections (Netflix, Amazon Prine, Hulu). I then got a Chrome Cast which enabled me to access CBS All Access and Acorn TV -- but navigation using my phone was unwieldy and casting took a long time. The Firestick's remote control makes it easy to navigate and to add new apps (e.g., cable TV stations). I've now bought additional ones as gifts and for TVs in other rooms."
"4897","I enjoy the Fire TV Stick.  Compared to a Google Chromecast there are some things missing and  some things that are improved.  With the chromecast you have to use some other device to control it, with the fire stick there is a remote that you can speak into.  Unfortunately, it can be a little persnickety at times.  And it doesn't have the ease of casting from another device as well as chromecast. But, overall, I am very happy with the fire stick."
"4898","Didn't purchase through Amazon but at a store. I really like this stick compared to other devices I currently have with the exception of my internet causes some streaming services to buffer on this. According to back of the box buffering isn't supposed to be an issue. But compared to some of the other devices this one fares better than the others I have."
"4899","We got it for our daughter for Christmas (she's 6) in no time at all she figured out how to work it and uses Alexa all the time! She still gets our DirectTV programming which ends up saving me $$ on our DTV bill!! Our family loves it I highly recommended it!"
"4900","Short story: I love Chromecast.  Amazon Prime content can't be streamed on Chromecast.  I'm left with few other options.  I decide to buy a Fire Stick.  It does everything well enough.  Alexa is growing up.  Ultimately I wish mommy and daddy would stop fighting so I could stream Prime to Chromecast.Honestly Fire Stick is good.  If you don't care about Prime content, Chromecast is so much better."
"4901","Still trying to get used to it and learning it.How can I find local news station,up to DATE news from Fox News (national)and Weather.  Is there a guide somewhere as to what is  streaming,  other running thru each clip?"
"4902","Had 1 Amazon and 1 Roku.  Was always having issues with the Roku stick. Difficult startups and program stalls.  Changed to fire stick problem solved.The Fire sticks run a little faster and without less issues than Roku sticks now."
"4903","This is awesome! We had a fire stick before. But needed one for another TV and Alexa remote is the ticket! So much easier than typing in and searching for what you want to watch. I know, first world problems, but it's pretty darn handy!"
"4904","This item is wonderful. It was given to me as a gift, and it's one of the best gifts ever!I am able to put so many of my favorite apps on it to watch anytime I care to, even yoga and exercise ones.Thanks for this great item."
"4905","I like the Firestick very much.......I have not used Alexis yet, but really find the product easy to use and navigate."
"4906","I love it!!!! This is the best invention since sliced bread and pockets on a shirt!!! I love love love our Firestick!!"
"4907","Firestick what a great product! Got it quick and the wife loaded Kobi on it by watching a U tube video. We love it. Hurry up and get yours ordered ! 😬"
"4908","Works well. Had to move from behind the tv to get solid wifi connection but then worked well.  Love being able to use Netflix and Prime in hotel rooms."
"4909","This product took a while to set up.  I wish detailed instructions came with it.  I had to use youtube.com to get it set up.  Otherwise, it works good."
"4910","Worth the price. Can bring my Hulu and Netflix account with me when I go to my boyfriends house and easily hook it up."
"4911","So easy to set up so easy to use cheap enough to have one of every television set  All you need is high-speed Internet"
"4912","Works well. The only problem is slow internet. We are at the end of our line. We need to switch service. We love the fire stick."
"4913","Could not have asked for a better accessory. Saving money and enjoying to the fullest the little time I have for entertainment."
"4914","The Amazon fire stick is everything I hoped it would be and then some. I highly recommend it for people that want quality TV"
"4915","I absolutely LOVE my new fire stick!! I can't believe all that I can watch! My music is on there too so whether I'm cleaning or entertaing, I can crank it up! Best Christmas present I bought myself this year!!! And Alexa finds me the best stuff!! Highly recommend this!"
"4916","Really like the product! There is so much you can do with it. Would be even better if the picture fit my tv screen! The new fire  stick does not have the ability to calibrate to screen and my older flat screen tv doesn't have the ""overscan"" feature to turn off."
"4917","You've got to have this - tired of paying cable bills of nearly $200 a month -for nothing loving NETFLIX and all I want to see..."
"4918","Very easy to set up & use. I got rid of all of my premium channels with my cable provider & haven't missed any of my shows. Watched the season premier of Power the day b4 it came on. Saving a lot of money now that I invested in the Fire Stick! 👍"
"4919","Excellent, easy to use, turned my older tv into a smart tv.. nice not having to go online to connect to netflix or amazon"
"4920","Excellent product. Couldn't be simpler to install and works just as advertised. I just recently started streaming and this is just what I needed."
"4921","Too many apps installed with no useful instructions. Guess i'll have to find a neighborhood 10-year old to sort it out for me."
"4922","I really enjoy using my fire stick. I purchased a newer version, but I like the old version better. I do like the difference in the remotes, the new one is slightly bigger, than my old one. I still lose it, but find it a lot quicker. Overall, I enjoy it, because I choose what I want to see and hear. That alone is 5 stars!!!!!. Thanks...."
"4923","Brilliant device.... Lots of streaming capabilities.... I couldn't be happier with my purchases.... It's truly a whole new experience every time I turn on my device...."
"4924","I really like this device. A few things I have learned: When I use the voice command, it only seems to search through the Amazon stuff, not the other apps (Hulu, Netflix etc). Some apps that run great on Roku run horribly on this device. Case in point is The Great Courses Plus app, which fails about every hour. Otherwise, I have been able to stop using the Chromecast I had in the living room, and this is similar to a Roku stick I have in our bedroom."
"4925","This works so much better then roku.. I will have to say that you need to use what's in the box, I ordered a short cabled usb to get power from the tv itself. That didn't work very good. I recommend this product 100%."
"4926","The cord was to short, when I tried to use an alternative cord, which has worked before when needed, it would not allow the fire stick to work😦 I wish the cord had been longer is my primary complaint."
"4927","Have to restart the fire-stick about once a week, as it degrades in performance until it reports that there are network issues before finally needing a reboot. After that it is happy again. Sits in the same cabinet with apple tv, xbox, tivo, all of which work flawlessly."
"4928","I just bought this for my sister in law for her birthday and I set it up for her before sending it out to her. I have the older version. This one seems faster and has of course has Alexa which is nice."
"4929","Super! The All-New Fire TV Stick with Voice Remote works great! Picture and Sound quality is excellent. I use it for Netflix and couldn't be happier. For the price, I recommend it!"
"4930","Turned my dumb TV into a smart TV. I'm finally using the Netflix and Amazon Prime subscriptions I was already paying for, on my TV and without hassle. Things like ESPN, ABC, and Comedy Central require connecting to a cable subscription, but now I can access those things in other rooms without paying for more cable boxes. By far my best purchase ever, and I intend on buying another fire stick for my other tv, and eventually expanding to the Echo."
"4931","I like having access to most of the current apps, all in one place.  It's also a lot easier to travel with than the Chromecast, and I like having a remote rather than having to rely on my phone.It may just be me, though, but the video output seems a little washed out.  I may have to check my video settings, but compared to the TiVo on another HDMI port, same television, the Fire Stick's output seems like it has a gray filter over it."
"4932","It streams very well, better than I expected. Sometimes it freezes but I'm not sure if it's the stick or my internet connection that freezing it. But overall I have no other complaints, currently I stream direct tv ,Hulu and Netflix . I'm very happy with my purchase. Also went back and bought one for my sons room as well."
"4933","Not impressed. No vudu which my blu ray had. Cannot power down when my wifi acts up which worked with my blu ray, no volume/tv power control which my blu Ray remote offered. Should have researched more before purchasing but the other reviews were great I didn't think I needed to make sure I wasn't downgrading with Amazon."
"4934","Fantastic. Though I have many devices that can use to stream (Xbox/PS4, computer, Chromecast, Blu-ray player) this is the first device that I can use which doesn't feel like a pain. The remote is simple, intuitive and brings it all together. Have already purchased an additional one as a Christmas gift. Highly recommended."
"4935","I ordered a Fire Stick and a Roku player. After comparing them both, the Fire Stick works much quicker, but does not stream as quick or clear as the Roku. The Fire Stick has a lot of great options, but at the end of the day, the most important option for me is HD streaming and the Fire Stick couldn't meet my expectations."
"4936","An excellent product so far.The voice command even switches inputs to access movies or programs.Impressive!"
"4937","Works great!  Makes being outdoors on the patio much more enjoyable.  Nice to be able to just speak the movie you want to watch!"
"4938","The device works great and provides an easy portal to all the various media apps. I do think the navigation can be improved on as getting to specific media apps sometimes seems like a confusing process. This, however, did not diminish the use of the device as the voice control features make finding things super easy. I found out too, that you can use the remote to play some games, Sonic 2, in a limited fashion. I would still get a remote for a wider scale of play."
"4939","I'm loving my Fire TV Stick! This replaced an older model Roku which tested my patience each time I used it.  Setup was easy.  Speed is good.  Remote is easy to use.  No complaints!"
"4940","The Amazon fire stick is a great way to watch your favorite shows through the available apps. It has so many more options than our smart tv.The only complaints that I have is that some of the commercials are FAR TOO LOUD. It should be illegal to have such variation in volume. Also, the fire stick malfunctions initially, but after a system reset, I've had no issues. Would still recommend it to anyone."
"4941","Absolutely love it! Works great and is another fantastic way to watch the movies and shows that we are interested in."
"4942","Use this quite a bit and no trouble setting this up.  Love being able to watch the Amazon products as a prime member."
"4943","Love it and very easy to use. I have VUDU and the Fire TV does not have it as yet. It would be nice to get VUDU also."
"4944","It’s awesome and so much cheaper than cable or satellite...even with paying for extra services like Netflix and Hulu."
"4945","I love this.  Allows me to stream to it watch prime and Netflix and many other subscriptions I have all in one place."
"4946","Very happy. Much faster than my Roku 2 when watching SlingTV! Beautiful picture and Alexa is fantastic. Very pleased."
"4947","Neat apps.  Haven't really had a chance to work with some of the features yet, but like the potential of alexa voice."
"4948","Love it! of corse.... much easier than trying to scroll to each letter or number... it's my second one on my account."
"4949","A fantastic device. Easy to install and turned my TV into a ""smart"" tv. I even dumped my Apple TV in favor of FireStick. The voice remote works really good. It works with my Amazon Echo to control my Phillips Hue lights, retrieves data from Automatic Pro installed in my car, and my house thermostat and even solves math problems.  If you control your A/V surround system through the amplifier plug the FireStick into an HDMI slot on the amp, not the tv."
"4950","Makes navigating sites and T.V. channels so much easier and it can be taken with you when evacuating from hurricanes!"
"4951","Love it works great. Going to but one for every TV in the house. Good Bye high priced cable(Time Warner aka Spectrum)"
"4952","It almost set up itself.  Showed me the WIFI networks it found. I selected mine and it asked for the password and I was in.  Amazon prime came up and asked for my pin and my watch list was up.  Netflix was just as easy.  Picture quality is excellent with no drop outs or buffering that I experienced with my 11 year old blue ray player with an Ethernet connection. Navigation is intuitive and easy.  I have not used a lot of voice control yet but will."
"4953","Excellent- but streaming broadcast TV links do not have all major channels in this area.  Lots of content. Easy install"
"4954","Since I have broken my addiction to cable and started using service's like this I am happy I did. Going back to what television was has been great I was never able to view all 500 + channels on cable. Being able to have this service I do recommend the change to all. I am still Leary of amazon and what they are able to do but what else can you do we need our addictions satisfied some how."
"4955","This has changed my world. I had used a smart BluRay player for streaming. The resolution and connectivity through the Fire TV Stick is so much better and so much easier to use. One of these days I will also bring it with me on travel."
"4956","Very disappointed, I thought I would be able to watch live TV. You have to purchase shows and when you can watch something that's supposed to be live you have to fool around with punching in different codes. Not at all what I expected."
"4957","Just got my new Fire TV Stick yesterday and I love it!!!  So easy to install!  Great for streaming movies, etc.  I look forward to using it a lot more in the near future!"
"4958","It's awesome comes in a small box and small design but that's were small ends the endless amounts of TV shows, movies, etc is Infinite I highly recommend it forget cable."
"4959","I love the fire stick. No more cable bills or commercials, politics or news. It really is a fantastic product, very easy to install and use. Well worth the $"
"4960","I love having the ability to switch over to Amazon programing!  Catching up on all the shows my friends have been talking about.  I can't speak to the ease of installing as we had a friend's son do it for us."
"4961","I had to return the first one after constant rebooting and this one is doing the same thing.  I also find the voice response is never related to what I'm looking for.  I much prefer the original fire tv stick"
"4962","Easy to install, easy to use. Most importantly, I wanted a product I could use at home and take to a vacation house. Can take it anywhere there is WiFi and a HDMI port in the back of a TV. All the streaming apps I wanted are available. The voice remote is a great feature, too. I previously used an older Google Chromcast product and while I liked it, I found that the Firestick was much easier to set up and use when traveling."
"4963","Easy to use. There should be a free subscription to Amazon movies with purchase. No comparison thus far though. First time user"
"4964","This is my second firestick added one to another tv in the house. Love the new remote wish my old one had the Alexa one."
"4965","No screen calibration!!!??? We need a software update like right NOW to fix that. That is a major feature thay has been removed!"
"4966","Works as described. Easy to set up and easy to use.It would have 5 stars instead of 4 if the voice remote actually worked."
"4967","I've been thoroughly enjoying the use of the fire stick.  I have a habit of changing settings and downloading different builds.  I would recommend for a first timer NOT to change anything at first.  Look at all the youtube videos about the different builds until you feel you want to change a few things.  Remember, you can't always find the first build if you erase it and put another one on.  And the build that comes with the stick is very good."
"4968","Works okay. Difficult to find the shows you've been watching on your iPad. What you watch on your devices don't seem to be synced up with your account. A show I was watching on my iPad doesn't show up on the Firestick and I have to go searching for it. I also have an Apple TV and I would say that the simplicity of use between the two (Firestick and Apple TV) would be the Apple TV hands down.Easy setup but poor landscape maneuvering."
"4969","I love my new Firestick, but I came very close to returning it. No matter what I did, it would not turn on. In frustration, my last-ditch effort was to purchase and install new batteries in the remote. Lo and behold, that was the problem! The moral to the story? Don't trust that the included batteries are fresh and in working order. Message for Amazon? Either check that the batteries are good or knock a bit off the price and don't include them."
"4970","I receive a Fire TV Stick as a Christmas gift and am very happy with it. Not only can you put a ton of apps on it and keep busy for hours at a time but you can also load Kodi on it and watch just about anything you want. It's powerful enough to stream full length movies without any buffering issues and also plays in full H.D.Anyone wanting to eliminate their overpriced monthly cable service should seriously look into getting one of these."
"4971","Love the new fire sticks, I currently have 6 in the house. Supper easy to use and I prefer using this vs the smart tv"
"4972","We love it. Wished I had done this  along time ago. I'm raising 4 Grandchildren and this is awesome. Always something they want to watch."
"4973","Slightly dissapointed that Amazon tries to not let you use VUDU. I mean I understand why they wouldnt support VUDU, but they support Netflix and Hulu who are two of their main competiors as far as streaming goes. Overall though this product has streamlined the search for content."
"4974","Love it. So easy to install and use. Like it better then the smart TV in the living room. So much faster and a lot more choices. Will be getting them for every TV in the house. Already got one for the TV at work. Like it much better then the Roku we had at work. Highly recommend."
"4975","I cut off my cable and lost my FOX news channel so i purchased the firestick because it said i could have access. Well i need to sign into a cable account in order to watch it so for that i can just go back to cable."
"4976","Way better than my Apple TV. Alexa's voice recognition superiority was a big reason behind giving this a try. The layout is simple, searching is a breeze, and being an Amazon Prime member makes this money well spent."
"4977","We decided to do away with cable. I purchased a fire stick for two of our televisions and am pleased with the programs we can watch. We are Amazon Prime members so that helps us get more choices. Very easy to set up."
"4978","Great product. I have an Apple TV and I like this better. Only thing I wish was that you could cast your screen to the device from your iPhone or other Apple device but other than that a very fast productAnd processor and works great.Alexa isn't the smartest when you ask to play a show it doesn't just start playing where you left off instantly. You have to select which app you want to use and stuff. And by that time I could just go to it myself."
"4979","I think this tool is by far the best gift I could have ever received, I am having so much fun learning and getting around with it"
"4980","Having the Fire TV Stick has opened up a whole new world of television viewing; there's more available than we'll ever possibly watch.It's super easy to install and use, basically plug and play."
"4981","Just purchased this for my husband's birthday.  Set up was easy and we are still learning all that it can do but so far, extremely pleased."
"4982","This is a must have for the cable cutters out there, a great product with a variety of options. Fast and I can even play games with it."
"4983","For those of you that already have cable, this review is not for you. For those of you like myself that do not have cable, read this and the other reviews very carefully before buying. I thought I did but obviously didn't go deep enough. After downloading the Apps I was interested in, when I tried to watch any of them that had live coverage (PGA Golf, Fox News, Cooking, Fishing, etc.) they all required me to enter an activation code on each of their websites. One of the requirements on each of the pages was to provide your cable provider. We do not have cable, consequently I could not complete the activation to watch any of the events. Pretty disappointed in it. On the flip side, there are a number of apps that have movies you can watch, music you can listen to and other things that are entertaining. Bottom line for me is I can either buy cable to get full use of the Stick, or pay monthly subscriptions to the various sites, neither of which is going to happen. Since it was only 29 bucks, I'll hang on to it, but wouldn't buy it again knowing what I do now."
"4984","The Fire TV Stick is really amazing. I've only had it a few days, so I am still trying to find out all it has to offer. Tried searching every venue I could think of and it had the shows / movies I was looking for. Very easy to set up and operate. So far, no problems what so ever. Would recommend, and I have, to everyone."
"4985","This is fantastic,don't know why I waited so long to get it.  Makes your tv experience much better and more controllable."
"4986","Always a great buy, I have about 6 of them now on each tv (better than the standard ""Smart TV"" on all these new tvs."
"4987","I tend to slur, but it still gets me. It doesn't do meta well, though, i.e., it won't logout out of Netflix via voice alone."
"4988","Fantastic...esdy to set up in just 2 minutes and now I have access to all my web channels that I use on my tablet and phone."
"4989","I've bought 2 now and love them - one for the living room and one for my daughters' room. Very easy to use and manage."
"4990","great product! I love that I can speak to Alexa and she pulls up exactly what I am looking for.  It is easy to set up and once done it is easy to download other apps although some still need a cable/satellite subscription some apps are free to use and Amazon Prime has tons of content as well."
"4991","This is a second unit.  They're great and inexpensive enough that we can do more than one.  (I'm not likely to use the VOICE function, however.)"
"4992","So easy to set up and use! The setup wizard makes it seamless. Although it's small and not much bigger than a flash drive it does require a power adapter. First thing it did was update the software for about 10 minutes but that actually was the slowest step. Love the voice remote but it's so small I know it will get lost pretty soon. Picture quality is top notch but it probably depends on your internet connection speed (not an issue for me). Highly recommended!!"
"4993","I love this little stick. It works well and so easy to use. Amazon thought of everything by adding the extender piece. Great product."
"4994","This is perfect, and exceeded my expectation.I am already having Apple TV (3rd Gen), Chrome cast, Roku on my old TV.I was planned to buy 4th Gen Apple TV ($149+) for my new TV$. And tried this $30+ fire stick.Picture quality is awesome, streaming and processing speed is very fast. Seeing movies, tv shows in 4K UHD TV is fantastic.Especially Alexa is very helpful to search movies and tv shows. My kids are enjoying to search videos by voice."
"4995","Love the Fire TV Stick.  Probably going to order another.  We don't have NBC right now, so its great to be able to see the episodes we are missing.  Also, I am totally addicted to Netfix and Prime TV....great shows!!!!!"
"4996","I have one of these on every tv i own and have bought them for my dad.  Very easy to use.  I love i can monitor what my kids are watching.  Never have trouble finding somwthing to watch."
"4997","I was very surprised at all the thing it can do. But I do wish a manual had come with it. It takes me several tries to fun what I want.I believe it will great once I figure it out."
"4998","I like the fire stick because I can watch tv programs and movies whenever I want and the quality is pretty good too!"
"4999","Duh on me, I haven't learned how to use this Alexa, not yet but time will pass til I do....OR I""LL SEND IT BACK."
"5000","This is a life-changing little, inexpensive item. Get one if you have WiFi and a smart tv with an unused HDMI port!!"
